abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging disease with a relatively high case fatal ##ity rate . most cases have been reported from saudi arabia , and the disease epidemic potential is considered to be limited . however , human – human transmission has occurred , usually in the context of healthcare facility - associated outbreak ##s . the scientific and medical community depends on timely publication of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information on emerging diseases during outbreak ##s to appropriately target public health responses . in this review , we considered the academic response to four mer ##s co ##v outbreak ##s that occurred in al - has ##a in 2013 , jed ##dah in 2014 and ri ##yad ##h in 2014 and 2015 . we anal ##yse ##d 68 relevant ep ##ide ##mi ##ology articles . for articles for which submission dates were available , six articles were submitted during the course of an outbreak . one article was published within a month of the al - has ##a outbreak , and one each was accepted during the jed ##dah and ri ##yad ##h outbreak ##s . mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology articles were cited more frequently than articles on other subjects in the same journal issues . thus , most ep ##ide ##mi ##ology articles on mer ##s - co ##v were published with no prefer ##ential advantage over other articles . collaboration of the research community and the scientific publishing industry is needed to facilitate timely publication of emerging infectious diseases .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute respiratory illness with fever , cough and short ##ness of breath . up to date , it has resulted in 1826 human infections , including 64 ##9 deaths . analogous to pic ##orn ##avi ##rus 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cp ##ro ) , 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) is critical for initiation of the mer ##s - co ##v replication cycle and is thus regarded as a valid ##ated drug target . as presented here , our pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitors of enter ##ov ##irus 3 ##cp ##ro ( 6 ##b , 6 ##c and 6 ##d ) inhibit ##ed 3 ##cl ##pro of mer ##s - co ##v and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) with ic ##50 values ranging from 1 . 7 to 4 . 7 μ ##m and from 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 μ ##m , respectively . in mer ##s - co ##v - infected cells , the inhibitors showed anti ##vira ##l activity with ec ##50 values ranging from 0 . 6 to 1 . 4 μ ##m , by down ##re ##gul ##ating the viral protein production in cells as well as reducing secret ##ion of infectious viral particles into culture super ##nat ##ants . they also suppressed other α - and β - co ##vs from human and fe ##line origin . these compounds exhibited good select ##ivity index ( over 70 against mer ##s - co ##v ) and could lead to the development of broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs against emerging co ##vs and pic ##orn ##avi ##rus ##es .  
abstract recent observations and experimental evidence have purported that a virus causes sar ##s , but such viruses have been isolated in only less than half of sar ##s patients in some studies and vi ##rol ##ogist vincent plum ##mer of winnipeg ’ s national micro ##biology laboratory found that indeed 1 in 5 perfectly healthy canadians with a history of recent travel to asia had the virus . the ##rf ##ore sar ##s micro ##bio ##logic origins remain unclear . outbreak ##s of multi - drug resistant ( md ##r ) tuberculosis and the at ##yp ##ical my ##co ##ba ##cter ##ia simulate sar ##s on clinical , radio ##logic , ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic , and diagnostic laboratory grounds and it is only logical then to include them in the differential to find a definitive cause and cure for sar ##s .  
abstract the 2015 middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak in the republic of korea has provided an opportunity to improve our understanding of the spread of mer ##s linked to healthcare settings . here we designed a dynamic transmission model to analyze the mer ##s outbreak in the republic of korea based on confirmed cases reported during the period may 20 – july 4 , 2015 . our model explicitly incorporates super ##sp ##rea ##ding events and time - dependent transmission and isolation rates . our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios . specifically , we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures , especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration . early interventions within 1 ##week after the epidemic onset , for instance , including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , show a promising means to reduce the size ( > 71 % ) and duration ( > 35 % ) of the mer ##s epidemic . finally , we also present results of an uncertainty analysis focused on the role of super ##sp ##rea ##ding events .

abstract phylogenetic analysis of sar ##s corona ##virus isolate ##s based on the spike gene and protein sequence using neighbor - joining , maximum likelihood and bay ##esian inference methods indicated that a recent human sar ##s - co ##v isolate was closer to some human sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s from earlier epidemic phase than to the sar ##s - co ##v - like viruses isolated from wild animals during previous epidemic phase . a reasonable judgment based on phylogenetic relationship and sequence variations it is likely that the recent human sar ##s - co ##v isolate is closer to an unknown sar ##s - co ##v predecessor .  
summary background human infection with a novel corona ##virus named middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in saudi arabia and the middle east in september , 2012 , with 44 laboratory - confirmed cases as of may 23 , 2013 . we report detailed clinical and vi ##rol ##ogical data for two related cases of mer ##s - co ##v disease , after nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a french hospital . methods patient 1 visited dubai in april , 2013 ; patient 2 lives in france and did not travel abroad . both patients had underlying im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive disorders . we tested specimens from the upper ( nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s ) or the lower ( bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge , sp ##ut ##um ) respiratory tract and whole blood , plasma , and serum specimens for mer ##s - co ##v by real - time rt - pc ##r targeting the up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a genes of mer ##s - co ##v . findings initial clinical presentation included fever , chill ##s , and my ##al ##gia in both patients , and for patient 1 , dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extra ##corp ##ore ##al membrane oxygen ##ation ( ec ##mo ) . both patients developed acute renal failure . mer ##s - co ##v was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load ( e ##g , cycle threshold [ ct ] values of 22 · 9 for up ##e and 24 for or ##f ##1 ##a for a bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge sample from patient 1 ; ct values of 22 · 5 for up ##e and 23 · 9 for or ##f ##1 ##a for an induced sp ##ut ##um sample from patient 2 ) , whereas nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al specimens were weakly positive or inc ##on ##clusive . the two patients shared the same room for 3 days . the inc ##uba ##tion period was estimated at 9 – 12 days for the second case . no secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v was suspected . patient 1 died on may 28 , due to ref ##rac ##tory multiple organ failure . interpretation patients with respiratory symptoms returning from the middle east or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for mer ##s - co ##v with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed inc ##uba ##tion period of 12 days . im ##mun ##os ##up ##press ##ion should also be taken into account as a risk factor . funding french institute for public health surveillance , an ##r grant lab ##ex int ##eg ##rative biology of
abstract since it first appeared in china ' s guangdong province , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world , especially asia . little is known about its ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . we developed a modified discrete sir model including susceptible individuals , non - hospitalized sar ##s persons ; hospitalized patients , cured hospital patients , and those who have died due to sar ##s infection . here , we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non - hospitalized sar ##s patients . both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the sar ##s virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases , indicating that the control measures implemented in china are effective , and the outbreak pattern of acc ##um ##ula ##tive sar ##s cases in china is a log ##istic growth curve . we estimate the basic reproduction number r 0 of sar ##s virus is 2 . 87 in mainland of china , very close to the estimation ##s in singapore and hong kong .  
recent outbreak ##s of sar ##s - corona ##virus and mer ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) have heightened awareness about the lack of vaccines or anti ##vira ##l compounds approved for prevention or treatment of human or potential zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs . anti - co ##v drug development has long been challenged by the activity of a 3 ′ to 5 ′ proof ##rea ##ding ex ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se unique to co ##vs . recently , a promising nu ##cle ##osi ##de analogue with broad - spectrum activity against co ##vs has been identified . this review will discuss progress made in the development of anti ##vira ##l nu ##cle ##osi ##de and nu ##cle ##otide analogue ##s targeting viral rna synthesis as effective therapeutic ##s against co ##v infections and propose promising strategies for combination therapy .  
abstract the sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) pan ##de ##mic caused ten years ago by the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has stimulated a number of studies on the molecular biology of corona ##virus ##es . this research has provided significant new insight into many mechanisms used by the corona ##virus replication - transcription complex ( rt ##c ) . the rt ##c directs and coordinates processes in order to replicate and trans ##cr ##ibe the corona ##virus genome , a single - stranded , positive - sense rna of outstanding length ( [UNK] – 32 ##ki ##lo ##base ##s ) . here , we review the up - to - date knowledge on sar ##s - co ##v replica ##tive enzymes encoded in the or ##f ##1 ##b , i . e . , the main rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( ns ##p ##12 ) , the he ##lica ##se / trip ##hos ##pha ##tase ( ns ##p ##13 ) , two unusual rib ##on ##uc ##lea ##ses ( ns ##p ##14 , ns ##p ##15 ) and rna - cap methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##ses ( ns ##p ##14 , ns ##p ##16 ) . we also review how these enzymes co - operate with other viral co - factors ( ns ##p ##7 , ns ##p ##8 , and ns ##p ##10 ) to regulate their activity . these last ten years of research on sar ##s - co ##v have considerably contributed to un ##rave ##l structural and functional details of one of the most fascinating replication / transcription machine ##ries of the rna virus world . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ” .  
abstract introduction middle east respiratory corona ##virus virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) first emerged from saudi arabia in 2012 and has since been recognized as a significant human respiratory pathogen on a global level . methods in this narrative review , we focus on the prevention of mer ##s - co ##v . we searched pub ##med , em ##base , cochrane , sc ##opus , and google scholar , using the following terms : ‘ mer ##s ’ , ‘ mer ##s - co ##v ’ , ‘ middle east respiratory syndrome ’ in combination with ‘ prevention ’ or ‘ infection control ’ . we also reviewed the references of each article to further include other studies or reports not identified by the search . results as of nov 2019 , a total of 246 ##8 laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v were diagnosed mostly from middle eastern regions with a mortality rate of at least 35 % . a major outbreak that occurred outside the middle east ( in south korea ) and infections reported from 27 countries . mer ##s - co ##v has gained recognition as a pathogen of global significance . prevention of mer ##s - co ##v infection is a global public health priority . healthcare facility transmission and by extension community transmission , the main amplifier of persistent outbreak ##s , can be prevented through early identification and isolation of infected humans . while mer ##s - co ##v vaccine studies were initially hind ##ered by multiple challenges , recent vaccine development for mer ##s - co ##v is showing promise . conclusions the main factors leading to sustainability of mer ##s - co ##v infection in high risk court ##iers is healthcare facility transmission . mer ##s - co ##v transmission in healthcare facility mainly results from laps in infection control measures and late isolation of suspected cases . prevent ##ive measures for mer ##s - co ##v include disease control in camel ##s , prevention of camel to human transmission .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) main pro ##tea ##se or 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) is essential for the propagation of the corona ##vira ##l life cycle and is regarded as one of the main targets for structure - based anti - sar ##s drug design . it is an attractive approach to find new uses for old drugs as they have already been through extensive clinical testing and could easily be accelerated for clinical approval . briefly , we performed virtual screening of a database of small molecules against sar ##s 3 ##cl ##pro , analyzed inhibitor – pro ##tea ##se complexes , and identified several co ##valent and non - co ##valent inhibitors . several old drugs that bind to sar ##s 3 ##cl ##pro active site were selected and in si ##lic ##o der ##iva ##tized to generate co ##valent ir ##re ##vers ##ible inhibitors with enhanced affinity . furthermore , we show that ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ores derived from clusters of compounds resulting out of virtual screening could be useful probe ##s for future structure – activity relationship studies ( sar ##s ) and fine - tune the lead molecules identified .

abstract the genetically diverse or ##th ##oco ##rona ##vir ##inae ( co ##v ) family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock . viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future . currently , there are no approved therapeutic ##s for any human co ##v presenting a clear un ##met medical need . re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( rd ##v , gs - 57 ##34 ) is a mono ##ph ##os ##ph ##ora ##mi ##date pro ##dr ##ug of an aden ##osi ##ne analog with potent activity against an array of rna virus families including fi ##lov ##iri ##dae , para ##my ##x ##ov ##iri ##dae , p ##ne ##um ##ov ##iri ##dae , and or ##th ##oco ##rona ##vir ##inae , through the targeting of the viral rna dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) . we developed multiple ass ##ays to further define the breadth of rd ##v anti ##vira ##l activity against the co ##v family . here , we show potent anti ##vira ##l activity of rd ##v against endemic human co ##vs o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) and 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) with sub ##mic ##rom ##olar ec ##50 values . of known co ##vs , the members of the delta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus have the most diver ##gent rd ##rp as compared to sar ##s - and mer ##s - co ##v and both av ##ian and por ##cine members harbor a native residue in the rd ##rp that con ##fers resistance in beta - co ##vs . nevertheless , rd ##v is highly e ##ffi ##ca ##cious against por ##cine delta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( pd ##co ##v ) . these data further extend the known breadth and anti ##vira ##l activity of rd ##v to include both contemporary human and highly diver ##gent zoo ##not ##ic co ##v and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging co ##v .  
abstract highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es associated with a severe respiratory syndrome , including middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , have recently emerged . the mer ##s - co ##v epidemic started in 2012 and is still ongoing , with a mortality rate of approximately 35 % . no vaccine is available against mer ##s - co ##v and therapeutic options for mer ##s - co ##v infections are limited to pal ##lia ##tive and supportive care . a search for specific anti ##vira ##l treatments is urgently needed . corona ##virus ##es are enveloped viruses , with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell . le ##ct ##ins are attractive anti - corona ##virus candidates because of the highly g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted nature of the spike protein . we tested the anti ##vira ##l effect of griffiths ##in ( gr ##ft ) , a le ##ct ##in isolated from the red marine al ##ga griffiths ##ia sp . against mer ##s - co ##v infection . our results demonstrate that while displaying no significant cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city , griffiths ##in is a potent inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v infection . griffiths ##in also inhibit ##s entry into host cells of particles pseudo ##type ##d with the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein , suggesting that griffiths ##in inhibit ##s spike protein function during entry . spike proteins have a dual function during entry , they media ##te binding to the host cell surface and also the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane . time course experiments show that griffiths ##in inhibit ##s mer ##s - co ##v infection at the binding step . in conclusion , we identify griffiths ##in as a potent inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v infection at the entry step .  
abstract background since the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , the virus had caused a high case fatal ##ity rate . the clinical presentation of mer ##s varied from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to severe bilateral pneumonia , depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies . there are few studies examining the mortality predict ##ors in this disease . in this study , we examined clinical predict ##ors of mortality of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) infection . methods this is a retrospective analysis of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic admitted patients to a large tertiary mer ##s - co ##v center in saudi arabia over the period from april 2014 to march 2018 . clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysis was done using a binary regression model . results a total of 314 sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic mer ##s - co ##v patients were included in the analysis , with a mean age of 48 ( ± ##17 . 3 ) years . of these cases , 78 ( 24 . 8 % ) died . the following parameters were associated with increased mortality , age , wb ##c , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil count , serum album ##in level , use of a continuous renal replacement therapy ( cr ##rt ) and co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid use . the odd ratio for mortality was highest for cr ##rt and co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid use ( 4 . 95 and 3 . 85 , respectively ) . the use of inter ##fer ##on - rib ##avi ##rin was not associated with mortality in this co ##hort . conclusion several factors contributed to increased mortality in this co ##hort of mer ##s - co ##v patients . of these factors , the use of co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid and cr ##rt were the most significant . further studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 marked the second introduction of a highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus into the human population in the twenty - first century . the continuing introductions of mer ##s - co ##v from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , the subsequent travel - related viral spread , the unprecedented nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s and the high case - fatal ##ity rates highlight the need for prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic measures . scientific advancement ##s since the 2002 – 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) pan ##de ##mic allowed for rapid progress in our understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v and the development of therapeutic ##s . in this review , we detail our present understanding of the transmission and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , and discuss the current state of development of measures to combat emerging corona ##virus ##es . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nr ##mic ##ro . 2016 . 81 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein is known to media ##te receptor interaction and immune recognition and thus it is considered as a major target for vaccine design . the spike protein plays an important role in virus entry , virus receptor interactions , and virus tr ##op ##ism . sensitive diagnosis of sar ##s is essential for the control of the disease in humans . rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v s ##1 antigen was produced and pu ##rified for the development of mono ##cl ##onal and bi - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies . the hybrid ##oma ##s secret ##ing anti - s ##1 antibodies , f ##26 ##g ##18 and p ##13 ##6 . 8 ##d ##12 , were fused respectively with the y ##p ##4 hybrid ##oma to generate quad ##rom ##as . the sandwich elisa was formed by using f ##26 ##g ##18 as a coating antibody and bio ##tin ##yla ##ted f ##26 ##g ##18 as a detection antibody with a detection limit of 0 . 03 ##7 ##μ ##g / ml ( p < 0 . 02 ) . the same detection limit was found with p ##13 ##6 . 8 ##d ##12 as a coating antibody and bio ##tin ##yla ##ted f ##26 ##g ##18 as a detection antibody . the sensitivity was improved ( detection limit of 0 . 01 ##9 ##μ ##g / ml ) , however , when using bi - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( f1 ##57 ) as the detection antibody . in conclusion , the method described in this study allows sensitive detection of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s spike protein by sandwich elisa with bi - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibody and could be used for the diagnosis of patients suspected with sar ##s .  
abstract in order to gain entry into cells , diverse viruses , including e ##bola virus , sar ##s - corona ##virus and the emerging mer ##s - corona ##virus , depend on activation of their envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s by host cell pro ##tea ##ses . the respective enzymes are thus excellent targets for anti ##vira ##l intervention . in cell culture , activation of e ##bola virus , as well as sar ##s - and mer ##s - corona ##virus can be accomplished by the end ##osomal cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses , cat ##he ##ps ##in l ( ct ##sl ) and cat ##he ##ps ##in b ( ct ##sb ) . in addition , sar ##s - and mer ##s - corona ##virus can use ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses localized at the cell surface , for their activation . however , it is currently unclear which pro ##tea ##se ( s ) facilitate viral spread in the infected host . we report here that the cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se inhibitor k ##11 ##7 ##7 ##7 , ( ( 2 ##s ) - n - [ ( 1 ##e , 3 ##s ) - 1 - ( benz ##enes ##ulf ##ony ##l ) - 5 - ph ##en ##yl ##pen ##t - 1 - en - 3 - y ##l ] - 2 - { [ ( e ) - 4 - methyl ##pipe ##raz ##ine - 1 - carbon ##yl ] amino } - 3 - ph ##en ##yl ##pro ##pan ##ami ##de ) and closely - related vinyl ##sul ##fo ##nes act as broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##ls by targeting cat ##he ##ps ##in - mediated cell entry . k ##11 ##7 ##7 ##7 is already in advanced stages of development for a number of parasitic diseases , such as cha ##gas disease , and has proven to be safe and effective in a range of animal models . k ##11 ##7 ##7 ##7 inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v and e ##bola virus entry was observed in the sub - nano ##mo ##lar range . in order to assess whether cy ##stein ##e or ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses promote viral spread in the host , we compared the anti ##vira ##l activity of an opt ##imi ##zed k ##11 ##7 ##7 ##7 - derivative with that of cam ##osta ##t , an inhibitor of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and related ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses . employing a pathogen ##ic animal model of sar ##s - co ##v infection , we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v is driven by ser ##ine rather than cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses and can be effectively prevented by cam ##osta ##t . cam ##osta ##t has been clinical ##ly used to treat chronic pan ##cre ##ati ##tis , and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory corona ##virus infections . our results indicate that cam ##osta ##t ,
abstract the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , but the prop ##hyl ##actic treatment of sar ##s - co ##v is still under investigation . we constructed a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus containing a truncated n - terminal fragment of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) gene ( from − ##45 to 146 ##9 , designated ad - s ##n ) , which encoded a truncated s protein ( 490 amino - acid residues , a part of 67 ##2 amino - acid s ##1 subunit ) , and investigated whether this construct could induce effective immunity against sar ##s - co ##v in wi ##star rats . rats were im ##mun ##ized either sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly or intra ##nas ##ally with ad - s ##n once a week for three consecutive weeks . our results showed that all of the im ##mun ##ized animals generated humor ##al immunity against the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein , and the sera of im ##mun ##ized rats showed strong capable of protecting from sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . his ##top ##ath ##ological examination did not find evident side effects in the im ##mun ##ized animals . these results indicate that an aden ##ov ##ira ##l - based vaccine carrying an n - terminal fragment of the spike gene is able to eli ##cit strong sar ##s - co ##v - specific humor ##al immune responses in rats , and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract given the mode of transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) in contact with mer ##s patients are expected to be at risk of mer ##s infections . we evaluated the prevalence of mer ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) g in hc ##ws exposed to mer ##s patients and calculated the incidence of mer ##s - affected cases in hc ##ws . we enrolled hc ##ws from hospitals where confirmed mer ##s patients had visited . serum was collected 4 to 6 weeks after the last contact with a confirmed mer ##s patient . we performed an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) to screen for the presence of mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg and an indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence test ( ii ##ft ) to confirm mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg . we used a question ##naire to collect information regarding the exposure . we calculated the incidence of mer ##s - affected cases by dividing the sum of pc ##r - confirmed and ser ##ology - confirmed cases by the number of exposed hc ##ws in participating hospitals . in total , 116 ##9 hc ##ws in 31 hospitals had contact with 114 mer ##s patients , and among the hc ##ws , 15 were pc ##r - confirmed mer ##s cases in study hospitals . ser ##olo ##gic analysis was performed for 737 participants . elisa was positive in five participants and border ##line for seven . ii ##ft was positive for two ( 0 . 3 % ) of these 12 participants . among the participants who did not use appropriate personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) , ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity was 0 . 7 % ( 2 / 294 ) compared to 0 % ( 0 / 44 ##3 ) in cases with appropriate pp ##e use . the incidence of mer ##s infection in hc ##ws was 1 . 5 % ( 17 / 116 ##9 ) . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg among hc ##ws was higher among participants who did not use appropriate pp ##e .  
abstract background / purpose severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) proteins including or ##f ##6 inhibit type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) signaling . methods this study identified sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 - interacting proteins using the ph ##age displayed human lung cd ##na libraries , and examined the association of or ##f ##6 – host factor interaction with type i if ##n ant ##ago ##nism . after the fifth round of bio ##pan ##ning with es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli - synthesized or ##f ##6 - his tagged protein , the relative binding affinity of ph ##age clones to or ##f ##6 was determined using direct enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . results the highest affinity clone to or ##f ##6 displayed the c - terminal domain of np ##ip ##b ##3 ( nuclear por ##e complex interacting protein family , member b ##3 ; also named as ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol - 3 - kinase - related kinase sm ##g - 1 iso ##form 1 homo ##log ) . the co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay demonstrated the direct binding of or ##f ##6 to the c - terminal domain of np ##ip ##b ##3 in vitro . con ##fo ##cal imaging revealed a close col ##oca ##lization of sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 protein with np ##ip ##b ##3 in human promo ##no ##cytes . the dual lucifer ##ase reporter ass ##ay showed that the c - terminal domain of np ##ip ##b ##3 at ##ten ##uated the antagonist ##ic activity of sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 on if ##n - β - induced is ##re ( if ##n stimulated response element ) - responsive fire ##fly lucifer ##ase activity . in addition , con ##fo ##cal imaging and western b ##lot ##ting ass ##ays revealed that the increases in stat - 1 nuclear trans ##lo ##cation and ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation occurred in the trans ##fect ##ed cells expressing both genes of or ##f ##6 and np ##ip ##b ##3 , but not in the or ##f ##6 - expressing cells in response to if ##n - β . conclusion the over ##ex ##press ##ion of np ##ip ##b ##3 restored the if ##n - β responses in sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 expressing cells , indicating that the interaction of sar ##s co ##v or ##f ##6 and np ##ip ##b ##3 reduced type i if ##n ant ##ago ##nism by sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 .  
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was controlled by public health measures at a time when specific interventions such as anti ##vira ##l drugs , vaccines and im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py were not available . since then , several animal models have been developed for the study of sar ##s and , although no model replicate ##s the human disease in all aspects , the use of animal models for sar ##s has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py . consistency and rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others . here , we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of sar ##s pathogen ##esis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for sar ##s .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) is one of the predominant antigen ##ic protein and the most abundant shed antigen throughout the sar ##s - co ##v infection . this feature makes it a suitable molecular target for diagnostic applications . in this study the full length cod ##on opt ##imi ##zed np gene and its sub ##fra ##gm ##ent gene segment was clone ##d in a bacterial expression vector . the full length np could be expressed in e . coli at very high level within inclusion bodies . the inclusion bodies were successfully sol ##ub ##ili ##zed , pu ##rified under den ##at ##uring conditions employing im ##ac column and ref ##old ##ed . the non - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted np was used to im ##mun ##ize mice for hybrid ##oma development . the poly ##cl ##onal anti ##ser ##um from animals im ##mun ##ized with this rec ##om ##bina ##nt np protein was found to specifically recognize the np and its sub ##fra ##gm ##ents , thus demonstrating the im ##mun ##ogenic nature of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein . the np antigen or a sub ##fra ##gm ##ent could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic ass ##ay to monitor sar ##s - co ##v outbreak ##s by detecting the early human anti - sar ##s antibodies . in addition , the availability of the np fragments could facilitate ep ##ito ##pe mapping of anti - np mono ##cl ##onal ##s for identifying suitable sandwich pairs .  
summary masked palm ci ##vet ##s are highly susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . infected animals become less aggressive and develop p ##yre ##xia , let ##har ##gy and dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . the present study describes the spectrum of his ##top ##ath ##ological changes in the lung , sp ##leen , l ##ym ##ph node , liver , small int ##est ##ine , kidney and ce ##re ##br ##um of ci ##vet ##s infected experimental ##ly with sar ##s - co ##v . in - situ hybrid ##ization ( is ##h ) with probe ##s specific for the rna polymer ##ase gene demonstrated viral rna in the lung , small int ##est ##ine and ce ##re ##br ##um only . in - situ label ##ling was employed in order to demonstrate cellular ap ##op ##tosis in the ce ##re ##br ##um , but there was no evidence of ap ##op ##tosis within the my ##oca ##rdi ##um . these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v causes multi - organ pathology in ci ##vet ##s , similar to that observed in human sar ##s patients . these parallels suggest that ci ##vet ##s may be used as an animal model of this infection to gain insight into the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs .  
abstract the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) resulted in several outbreak ##s worldwide . early tests for diagnosis were not always con ##clusive in identifying a sar ##s suspected patient . nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) is the most predominant virus derived structural protein which is shed in high amounts in serum and nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate during the first week of infection . as part of such efforts , a simple , easy to use im ##mun ##os ##wa ##b method was developed by generating a panel of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) , bis ##pe ##ci ##fi ##c mab ##s and chicken poly ##cl ##onal i ##gy antibody against the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) . employing the mab - based im ##mun ##os ##wa ##b , an np concentration of 200 ##pg / ml in saline and pig nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate , and 500 ##pg / ml in rabbit serum were detected . bs ##ma ##b - based im ##mun ##os ##wa ##bs detected an np concentration of 20 ##pg / ml in saline , 500 ##pg / ml in rabbit serum and 20 – 200 ##pg / ml in pig nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate . poly ##cl ##onal i ##gy - based im ##mun ##os ##wa ##bs detected an np concentration of 10 ##pg / ml in pig nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate providing the most sensitive sar ##s point of care ass ##ay . results show that the robust im ##mun ##os ##wa ##b method of detecting sar ##s - co ##v np antigen can be developed into an easy and effective way of identifying sar ##s suspected individuals during a future sar ##s epidemic , thereby reducing and containing the transmission . the key feature of this simple im ##mun ##os ##wa ##b diagnostic ass ##ay is its ability to detect the presence of the sar ##s - co ##v antigen within 45 – 60 ##min with the availability of the body fluid samples .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v was the cause of the global pan ##de ##mic in 2003 that infected over 800 ##0 people in 8 months . vaccines against sar ##s are still not available . we developed a novel method to produce high levels of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) vaccine containing the sar ##s spike ( s ) protein and the influenza m1 protein using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus insect cell expression system . these chi ##meric sar ##s v ##lp ##s have a similar size and morphology to the wild type sar ##s - co ##v . we tested the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protective efficacy of pu ##rified chi ##meric sar ##s v ##lp ##s and full length sar ##s s protein vaccines in a mouse lethal challenge model . the sar ##s v ##lp vaccine , containing 0 . 8 ##μ ##g of sar ##s s protein , completely protected mice from death when administered intra ##mus ##cular ( im ) or intra ##nas ##al ( in ) routes in the absence of an ad ##ju ##vant . likewise , the sar ##s v ##lp vaccine , containing 4 ##μ ##g of s protein without ad ##ju ##vant , reduced lung virus ti ##ter to below detect ##able level , protected mice from weight loss , and eli ##cite ##d a high level of neutral ##izing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v . sf ##9 cell - produced full length pu ##rified sar ##s s protein was also an effective vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v but only when co - administered im with aluminum hydro ##xide . sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s are highly im ##mun ##ogenic and induce neutral ##izing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge . sf ##9 cell - based v ##lp vaccines are a potential tool to provide protection against novel pan ##de ##mic agents .  
sar ##s - co ##v is a pathogen ##ic corona ##virus that emerged from a zoo ##not ##ic reservoir , leading to global dissemination of the virus . the association sar ##s - co ##v with abe ##rran ##t cy ##tok ##ine , che ##mo ##kin ##e , and inter ##fer ##on stimulated gene ( is ##g ) responses in patients provided evidence that sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis is at least partially controlled by innate immune signaling . utilizing models for sar ##s - co ##v infection , key components of innate immune signaling pathways have been identified as protective factors against sar ##s - co ##v disease , including stat ##1 and my ##d ##8 ##8 . gene transcription signatures unique to sar ##s - co ##v disease states have been identified , but host factors that regulate ex ##ace ##rba ##ted disease ph ##eno ##type ##s still remain largely und ##eter ##mined . sar ##s - co ##v en ##codes several proteins that mod ##ulate innate immune signaling through the ant ##ago ##nism of the induction of inter ##fer ##on and by avoidance of is ##g effect ##or functions .  
summary currently , the emergence of a novel human corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans . human - to - human transmissions have been described with inc ##uba ##tion times between 2 - 10 days , facilitating its spread via droplets , contaminated hands or surfaces . we therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary corona ##virus ##es on ina ##ni ##mate surfaces as well as ina ##ct ##ivation strategies with bio ##ci ##dal agents used for chemical di ##sin ##fect ##ion , e . g . in healthcare facilities . the analysis of 22 studies reveals that human corona ##virus ##es such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus or endemic human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) can persist on ina ##ni ##mate surfaces like metal , glass or plastic for up to 9 days , but can be efficiently inactivated by surface di ##sin ##fect ##ion procedures with 62 – 71 % ethanol , 0 . 5 % hydrogen per ##oxide or 0 . 1 % sodium h ##yp ##och ##lor ##ite within 1 minute . other bio ##ci ##dal agents such as 0 . 05 – 0 . 2 % benz ##al ##kon ##ium chloride or 0 . 02 % ch ##lor ##he ##xi ##dine dig ##lu ##cona ##te are less effective . as no specific the ##ra ##pies are available for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread .  
abstract bats are the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) which caused the outbreak of human sar ##s in 2002 – 2003 . we introduce the genetic diversity of sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##sr - co ##vs ) discovered in bats and provide insights on the bat origin of human sar ##s . we also analyze the viral geographical structure that may improve our understanding of the evolution of bat sar ##sr - co ##vs .  
abstract the emergence of new pathogen ##s , such as middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for methods to rapidly identify and character ##ize potential therapeutic or prevention options , such as neutral ##izing antibodies . spike ( s ) proteins are present on the surface of mer ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s and media ##te viral entry . s is the primary target for mer ##s - co ##v vaccine and antibody development , and it has become increasingly important to understand mer ##s - co ##v antibody binding specific ##ity and function . commonly used ser ##ological methods like elisa , bio ##layer inter ##fer ##ome ##try , and flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry are inform ##ative , but limited . here , we demonstrate a high - through ##put protein binding inhibition ass ##ay using image cy ##tom ##et ##ry . the image cy ##tom ##et ##ry - based high - through ##put screening method was developed by selecting a cell type with high d ##pp ##4 expression and defining optimal seed ##ing density and protein binding conditions . the ability of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies to inhibit mer ##s - co ##v s binding was then tested . binding inhibition results were comparable with those described in previous literature for mer ##s - co ##v spike mono ##mer and showed similar patterns as neutral ##ization results . the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of our cell - based ass ##ay was < 10 % . the proposed image cy ##tom ##et ##ry method provides an efficient approach for character ##izing potential therapeutic antibodies for combat ##ing mer ##s - co ##v that compares favorably with current methods . the ability to rapidly determine direct antibody binding to host cells in a high - through ##put manner can be applied to study other pathogen - antibody interactions and thus can impact future research on viral pathogen ##s .  
abstract in order to stimulate the development of drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , based on the atomic coordinates of the sar ##s corona ##virus main protein ##ase determined recently [ science 13 ( may ) ( 2003 ) ( online ) ] , studies of docking k ##z ##70 ##8 ##8 ( a derivative of ag ##70 ##8 ##8 ) and the av ##l ##q ##sg ##fr oct ##ape ##pt ##ide to the enzyme were conducted . it has been observed that both the above compounds interact with the active site of the sar ##s enzyme through six hydrogen bonds . also , a clear definition of the binding pocket for k ##z ##70 ##8 ##8 has been presented . these findings may provide a solid basis for sub ##sit ##e analysis and mu ##tage ##nes ##is relative to rational design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic application . meanwhile , the idea of how to develop inhibitors of the sar ##s enzyme based on the knowledge of its own peptide substrates ( the so - called “ distorted key ” approach ) was also briefly el ##uc ##ida ##ted .  
abstract emerging and re - emerging pathogen ##s and bio ##ter ##ror threats require an organized and coherent response from the worldwide research community to maximize available resources and compete ##ncies with the primary goals to understand the pathogen and enable intervention . in 2001 , the structural pro ##te ##omics in europe ( spine ) project prototype ##d the pan - viral structural gen ##omic approach , and the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in 2003 accelerated the concept of structural characterization of all proteins from a viral pro ##te ##ome and the interaction with their host partners . following that approach , in 2004 the center for functional and structural pro ##te ##omics for sar ##s - co ##v related proteins was initiated as part of the us ni ##h ni ##aid pro ##te ##omics resource centers . across worldwide efforts in asia , europe and america , the international research teams working on sar ##s - co ##v have now determined experimental structural information for 45 % of the sar ##s - co ##v proteins and 53 % of all its soluble proteins . this data is fully available to the scientific community and is providing an unprecedented level of insight to this class of rna viruses . the efforts and results by the international scientific community to the sar ##s outbreak are serving as an example and road ##ma ##p of a rapid response using modern research methods .  
abstract the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) main protein ##ase is a key enzyme in viral poly ##pro ##tein processing . to allow structure - based design of drugs directed at sar ##s - co ##v main protein ##ase , we predicted its binding pockets and af ##fin ##ities with existing hiv , psychotic and parasite drugs ( lo ##pina ##vir , ri ##ton ##avi ##r , nic ##los ##ami ##de and prom ##azi ##ne ) , which show signs of inhibit ##ing the replication of sar ##s - co ##v . our results suggest that these drugs and another two hiv inhibitors ( p ##nu and uc ##2 ) could be used as template ##s for designing sar ##s - co ##v protein ##ase inhibitors .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was the first pan ##de ##mic in the 21st century to claim more than 700 lives worldwide . however , effective anti - sar ##s vaccines or medications are currently unavailable despite being desperately needed to adequately prepare for a possible sar ##s outbreak . sar ##s is caused by a novel corona ##virus , and one of its components , a viral he ##lica ##se , is emerging as a promising target for the development of chemical sar ##s inhibitors . in the following review , we describe the characterization , family classification , and kinetic movement mechanisms of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sc ##v ) he ##lica ##se — ns ##p ##13 . we also discuss the recent progress in the identification of novel chemical inhibitors of ns ##p ##13 in the context of our recent discovery of the strong inhibition of the sar ##s he ##lica ##se by natural fl ##av ##ono ##ids , my ##rice ##tin and sc ##ute ##llar ##ein . these compounds will serve as important resources for the future development of anti - sar ##s medications .  
abstract virus vaccines have to be im ##mun ##ogenic , sufficiently stable , safe , and suitable to induce long - lasting immunity . to meet these requirements , vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of ( i ) the protective roles of anti ##vira ##l b and t - cell - mediated immune responses , ( ii ) the complexity and plastic ##ity of major viral antigen ##s , and ( iii ) virus molecular biology and pathogen ##esis . there are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines , whole - inactivated virus , vector ##ed , and live - at ##ten ##uated virus vaccines , each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations . while non ##li ##ving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable , they may cause side effects and be less e ##ffi ##ca ##cious compared to live - at ##ten ##uated virus vaccines . in most cases , the latter induce long - lasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent rev ##ers ##ion to highly vi ##ru ##lent viruses following va ##cci ##nation . the chapter sum ##mar ##izes the recent progress in the development of corona ##virus ( co ##v ) vaccines , focusing on two zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs , the severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and the middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v , both of which cause deadly disease and epidemic ##s in humans . the development of at ##ten ##uated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogen ##ic co ##vs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral vi ##ru ##lence proteins that , for example , interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types , such as macro ##pha ##ges , den ##dr ##itic and ep ##ith ##elial cells , and t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , thereby mod ##ulating anti ##vira ##l host responses and viral pathogen ##esis and potentially resulting in del ##eter ##ious side effects following va ##cci ##nation .  
abstract the open reading frame 3 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome en ##codes a predicted protein 3a , consisting of 274 amino acids , that lacks any significant similarities to any known protein . we generated specific antibodies against sar ##s protein 3a by using a synthetic peptide ( p ##2 ) corresponding to amino acids 261 – 274 of the put ##ative protein . anti - p ##2 antibodies and the sera from sar ##s patients could specifically detect the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s protein 3a expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . expression of sar ##s protein 3a was detected at 8 – 12 h after infection and reached a higher level after [UNK] h in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . protein 3a was also detected in the al ##ve ##olar lining p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and some intra - al ##ve ##olar cells of a sar ##s - co ##v - infected patient ' s lung specimen . rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein 3a expressed in ve ##ro e ##6 cells and protein 3a in the sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells was distributed over the cy ##top ##las ##m in a fine pun ##cta ##te pattern with partly concentrated stain ##ing in the go ##l ##gi apparatus . our study demonstrates that sar ##s - co ##v indeed expresses a novel protein 3a , which is present only in sar ##s - co ##v and not in other known co ##vs .  
abstract cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continue to be identified and with a lack of effective clinical treatment and no prevent ##ative strategies , treatment using con ##vale ##scent plasma or mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) is a potential quick route to an intervention . passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py via either con ##vale ##scent plasma or mab ##s has proven to be effective for other infectious agents . following infection with mer ##s - co ##v , common mar ##mos ##ets were treated with high ti ##ter hyper ##im ##mun ##e plasma or the mab m3 ##36 , at 6 and 48 h post in ##oc ##ulation . both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease , but reduction in viral loads in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyper ##im ##mun ##e plasma group . a decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mab - treated group , but no his ##to ##logical differences were observed between treated and control animals . while both hyper ##im ##mun ##e plasma and the m3 ##36 treatments reduced the severity of disease in the common mar ##mos ##et , neither treatment resulted in full protection against disease .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel corona ##virus that was identified in 2012 in saudi arabia . it is associated with significant mortality and mor ##bid ##ity . we identified factors associated with the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) infection among suspected cases presented with sign and symptoms of upper respiratory infection or exposure to the virus . we also looked at the impact of medication history on virus transmission . method : we included subjects with suspected mer ##s - co ##v infection and confirmed cases of mer ##s infection . subjects were excluded if there were any missing data that prevent the final analysis . descriptive statistics were used to report demographic data . percentage ##s and frequencies were used to sum ##mar ##ize the cat ##egorical variables , while means and standard deviation ##s were calculated for continuous variables . log ##istic regression was used to assess the risk of mer ##s - co ##v infection among the suspected cases . a value of p < 0 . 05 was considered statistical ##ly significant . results : a total of 16 , 189 suspected cases were identified , complete data were analyzed for 315 ##4 to assess factors that are independently associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection . mer ##s - co ##v infection was associated with age ( adjusted odds ratio [ ao ##r ] = 1 . 06 ; 95 % ci [ 1 . 02 – 1 . 09 ##8 ] , p - value = 0 . 00 ##4 ) , male gender ( ao ##r = 1 . 61 ##7 ; 95 % ci [ 1 . 365 – 1 . 77 ] , p - value < 0 . 001 ) and diabetes ( ao ##r = 1 . 68 ; 95 % ci [ 1 . 34 ##6 – 1 . 84 ##8 ] , p - value = 0 . 00 ##2 . there was no significant association with the other como ##rb ##idi ##ties . medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection . conclusions : mer ##s - co ##v infection is more common in male , advanced age and diabetes . no medications were associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection . this is important to focus on screening and detection to this patient population .  
abstract since 2012 , mer ##s - co ##v has caused up to 222 ##0 cases and 79 ##0 deaths in 27 countries with saudi arabia being the most affected country with ~ 83 . 1 % of the cases and ~ 38 . 8 % local death rate . current ser ##ological ass ##ays such as micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ( mn ) , plaque reduction neutral ##ization , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , protein micro ##ar ##ray or pseudo ##par ##tic ##le neutral ##ization ass ##ays rely on handling of live mer ##s - co ##v in high containment laboratories or need for expensive and special equipment and re ##age ##nts and highly trained personnel which represent a technical hurdle for most laboratories in resource - limited mer ##s - co ##v endemic countries . here , we developed , compared and evaluated three different indirect elisa ##s based on mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) , spike ( s ) ec ##to ##dom ##ain ( amino acids 1 – 129 ##7 ) and s ##1 subunit ( amino acids 1 – 72 ##5 ) and compared them with mn ass ##ay . the developed elisa ##s were evaluated using large number of confirmed ser ##op ##osi ##tive ( 79 samples ) and ser ##one ##gative ( 274 samples ) mer ##s - co ##v human serum samples . both rs ##1 - and rs - elisa ##s maintained high sensitivity and specific ##ity ( ≥ ##90 % ) across a wider range of o ##d values compared to rn - elisa . moreover , rs ##1 - and rs - based elisa ##s showed better agreement and correlation with mn ass ##ay in contrast to rn - elisa . collectively , our data demonstrate that rs ##1 - elisa and rs - elisa are more reliable than rn - elisa and represent a suitable choice for ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological testing and surveillance in mer ##s - co ##v endemic regions .  
abstract the tertiary structures of the s ##1 and s ##2 domains of the spike protein of the corona ##virus which is responsible of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) have been recently predicted . here a molecular assembly of sar ##s corona ##virus pep ##lom ##er which accounts for the available functional data is suggested . the interaction between s ##1 and s ##2 appears to be stab ##ilised by a large hydro ##phobic network of aromatic side chains present in both domains . this feature results to be common to all corona ##virus ##es , suggesting potential targeting for drugs preventing corona ##virus - related infections .  
since the outbreak of the novel corona ##virus disease co ##vid - 19 , caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , this disease has spread rapidly around the globe . considering the potential threat of a pan ##de ##mic , scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of this disease to uncover possible treatment regime ##ns and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines . to support the current research and development , cas has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the cas content collection . it highlights anti ##vira ##l strategies involving small molecules and bio ##logic ##s targeting complex molecular interactions involved in corona ##virus infection and replication . the drug - rep ##ur ##po ##sing effort documented here ##in focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other rna viruses including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . the patent analysis of corona ##virus - related bio ##logic ##s includes therapeutic antibodies , cy ##tok ##ines , and nuclei ##c acid - based the ##ra ##pies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines . more than 500 patents disclose method ##ologies of these four bio ##logic ##s with the potential for treating and preventing corona ##virus infections , which may be applicable to co ##vid - 19 . the information included in this report provides a strong intellectual ground ##work for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines .  
abstract the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is associated with close contact to sar ##s patients and drop ##let secret ##ions of those patients . the finding of positive rt - pc ##r results from stool ##s of sar ##s patients suggests that stool ##s of sar ##s patients or sewage containing stool ##s of patients could transmit sar ##s - co ##v . we used a novel style of electro ##po ##sit ##ive filter media particle to concentrate the sar ##s - co ##v from the sewage of two hospitals receiving sar ##s patients in beijing . we also used cell culture , rt - pc ##r and gene sequencing to detect and identify the viruses from sewage . no infectious sar ##s - co ##v contamination was found in any of the samples collected , but the nuclei ##c acid of sar ##s - co ##v could be detected in the sewage from the two hospitals before di ##sin ##fect ##ion . while the rna was only detected in three samples from the 309 ##th hospital , the others were negative after di ##sin ##fect ##ion . these findings provide strong evidence that sar ##s - co ##v can be ex ##cre ##ted through the stool / urine of patients into sewage system , thus making the sewage system a possible route of transmission .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus main pro ##tea ##se ( sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro ) has been proposed as a prime target for anti - sar ##s drug development . we have clone ##d and over ##ex ##pressed the sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli , and pu ##rified the rec ##om ##bina ##nt mp ##ro to homo ##gen ##eit ##y . the kinetic parameters of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro were characterized by high performance liquid ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy - based ass ##ay and continuous flu ##orescence - based ass ##ay . two novel small molecule inhibitors of the sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro were identified by high - through ##put screening using an internally que ##nched flu ##oro ##genic substrate . the identified inhibitors have k i values at low μ ##m range with comparable anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity in cell - based ass ##ays .  
abstract background an ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##vid 2019 , sar ##s - co ##v ##2 ) started in wu ##han , hub ##ei , in china at the end of december 2019 . the french government decided to rep ##at ##ria ##te the 337 french nationals living in wu ##han and place them in qu ##aran ##tine in their home country . we decided to test them all for sar ##s - co ##v ##2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision - makers . methods we investigated the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 19 in as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers by testing all rep ##at ##riated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in france and at day 5 . viral rna was extracted from poole ##d nasal and oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab fluids or sp ##ut ##um in the absence of nasal / oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was then carried out using several real - time reverse transcription ( rt ) - pc ##r ass ##ays . results we tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5 . all the tests for sar ##s - co ##v ##2 were negative . by opt ##imi ##sing the sampling process , sending samples sequential ##ly and reducing the time - scale for biological analysis , we were able to test the samples within 5 h ( including sampling , shipment and biological tests ) . conclusion opt ##imi ##sing our procedures reduces anxiety and reassure ##s the population and decision makers .  
in the space of just six weeks , a new corona ##virus , from a family that historically was not viewed as a global health concern , has become daily headline news around the globe . the 21 ( st ) century marked its arrival with the emergence of three previously unknown corona ##virus ##es . sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ) was recognized in november 2002 [ 1 , 2 ] , mer ##s - co ##v ( middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ) in june 2012 [ 3 , 4 ] , and 2019 - nc ##ov in december 2019 [ 5 ] . previously , human corona ##virus ##es , known since the 1960s , were viewed as being only marginal ##ly relevant to the clinic , except for infants , the elderly , and im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised individuals [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] .  
what is co ##vid - 19 , and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation ? the virus responsible for co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , is in the species sar ##s - like corona viruses . at 125 nm , it is slightly larger than influenza , sar ##s and mer ##s viruses . it is almost certainly a descendant from a bat corona virus of which there are many . the closest is a virus that originated from the rhino ##lo ##phus bat which is > 96 % homo ##log ##ous with the current sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . it is only 79 % homo ##log ##ous with the original sar ##s co ##v [ 1 ] . the near identical gene sequences of 90 anal ##yse ##d cases from outside of china suggests it has likely emerged after a solitary species jump in early december 2019 from an unknown ( likely mammalian ) intermediate host [ 2 ] . pang ##olin ##s are an endangered ant - eating mammal from which scientists in guangzhou have shown a corona ##virus with 99 % homo ##logy , with a receptor binding domain identical to that of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . however , this has not been confirmed , and , in addition , the pang ##olin ' s ra ##rity means this may not be the only mammal involved .  
abstract background a highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus causing respiratory disease emerged in the middle east region in 2012 . in - house molecular diagnostic methods for this virus termed middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) allowed sensitive mer ##s - co ##v rna detection in patient samples . fast diagnosis is important to manage human cases and trace possible contacts . objectives the aim of this study was to improve the availability of existing nuclei ##c acid amp ##li ##fication - based diagnostic methods for mer ##s - co ##v infections by providing a real - time rt - pc ##r kit , including an internal control and two target regions recommended by the world health organization ( who ) . and to valid ##ate this kit ( real ##star ##® mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r kit 1 . 0 , alton ##a diagnostic ##s gmbh , hamburg , germany ) using clinical samples of one mer ##s - co ##v case from munich and respiratory samples of patients with other respiratory diseases . study design an internal amp ##li ##fication control was included into the rt - pc ##r ass ##ays targeting the gen ##omic region upstream of the envelope gene ( up ##e ) and within open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1a . based on these ass ##ays , a ready - to - use real - time rt - pc ##r kit featuring both the up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a ass ##ays was developed , valid ##ated and compared to the established in - house versions . results the performance of both rt - pc ##r ass ##ays included in the kit is comparable to the in - house ass ##ays . they show high analytical sensitivity ( up ##e : 5 . 3 copies / reaction ; or ##f ##1 ##a : 9 . 3 copies / reaction ) , no cross - react ##ivity with other respiratory pathogen ##s and detected mer ##s - co ##v rna in patient samples in almost the same manner as the in - house versions . conclusion the kit is a valuable tool for assisting in the rapid diagnosis , patient management and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of suspected mer ##s - co ##v cases .  
abstract background ninety confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have been reported to the world health organization . we report the details of a second family cluster of mer ##s - co ##v infections from ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia . methods we present the clinical , laboratory and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological details of 3 patients from a family cluster of mer ##s - co ##v infections . results the first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason . he died 11 days later with multi - organ failure . two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever . mer ##s - co ##v infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction testing . all 3 patients had fever , cough , short ##ness of breath , bilateral infiltrate ##s on chest x - ray , th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia , l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and rises in serum cr ##ea ##tin ##ine kinase and alan ##ine trans ##amina ##se . no hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection . it appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired mer ##s - co ##v infection whilst in hospital from an un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed mild or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case . conclusion mer ##s - co ##v acquisition from un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed mild or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic cases may be a more important contributor to ongoing transmission than previously appreciated .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 3a protein is one of the opening reading frames in the viral genome with no homo ##logue in other known corona ##virus ##es . expression of the 3a protein has been demonstrated during both in vitro and in vivo infection . here we present bio ##chemical data to show that 3a is a novel corona ##virus structural protein . 3a was detected in vi ##rion ##s pu ##rified from sar ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells although two truncated products were present predominantly instead of the full - length protein . in ve ##ro e ##6 cells transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed with a cd ##na construct for expressing 3a , a similar cleavage was observed . furthermore , co - expression of 3a , membrane and envelope proteins using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system showed that both full - length and truncated 3a can be assembled into virus - like particles . this is the first report that demonstrated the incorporation of 3a into vi ##rion and showed that the sar ##s - co ##v en ##codes a novel corona ##virus structural protein .  
abstract the middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute pneumonia and renal failure . the mer ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) is a potential target for the development of anti ##vira ##l drugs . to facilitate these efforts , we determined the three - dimensional structure of the enzyme by x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy . the molecule consists of a u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like domain and a catalytic core domain . the catalytic domain displays an extended right - hand fold with a zinc ribbon and embrace ##s a solvent - exposed substrate - binding region . the overall structure of the mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro is similar to that of the corresponding sar ##s - co ##v enzyme , but the architecture of the ox ##yan ##ion hole and of the s ##3 as well as the s ##5 specific ##ity sites differ from the latter . these differences are the likely reason for reduced in vitro peptide hydro ##lysis and de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activities of the mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , compared to the homo ##log ##ous enzyme from the sar ##s corona ##virus . introduction of a side - chain capable of ox ##yan ##ion stabilization through the le ##u ##10 ##6 ##tr ##p mutation greatly enhance ##s the in vitro catalytic activity of the mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . the unique features observed in the crystal structure of the mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro should allow the design of anti ##vira ##ls that would not interfere with host u ##bi ##qui ##tin - specific pro ##tea ##ses .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , mer ##s - co ##v . with the continuing spread of mer ##s - co ##v , prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic treatments are urgently needed . in this study , we prepared pu ##rified e ##quin ##e f ( ab ’ ) 2 from horses im ##mun ##ized with mer ##s - co ##v virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) expressing mer ##s - co ##v s , m and e proteins . both i ##gg and f ( ab ’ ) 2 efficiently neutral ##ized mer ##s - co ##v replication in tissue culture . passive transfer of e ##quin ##e immune antibodies significantly reduced virus ti ##ters and accelerated virus clearance from the lungs of mer ##s - co ##v infected mice . our data show that horses im ##mun ##ized with mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s can serve as a primary source of protective f ( ab ’ ) 2 for potential use in the prop ##hyl ##actic or therapeutic treatment of exposed or infected patients .  
background an important emerging respiratory virus is the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . mer ##s - co ##v had been associated with a high case fatal ##ity rate especially among severe cases . methods this is a retrospective analysis of reported mer ##s - co ##v cases between december 2016 and january 2019 , as retrieved from the world health organization . the aim of this study is to examine the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of reported cases and quan ##tify the percentage of health care workers ( hc ##ws ) among reported cases . results there were 403 reported cases with a majority being men ( n = 300 ; 74 . 4 % ) . these cases were reported from lebanon , malaysia , oman , qatar , saudi arabia , and united arab emirates . hc ##ws represented 26 % and como ##rb ##idi ##ties were reported among 71 % of non - hc ##ws and 1 . 9 % among hc ##ws ( p < . 000 ##1 ) . camel exposure and camel milk ing ##est ##ion were reported in 64 % each , and the majority ( 97 . 8 % ) of those with camel exposure ##s had camel milk ing ##est ##ion . there were 58 % primary cases and 42 % were secondary cases . the case fatal ##ity rate was 16 % among hc ##ws compared with 34 % among other patients ( p = . 001 ) . the mean age ± sd was 47 . 65 ± 16 . 28 for hc ##ws versus 54 . 23 ± 17 . 34 for non - hc ##ws ( p = . 001 ) . conclusions mer ##s - co ##v infection continues to have a high case fatal ##ity rate and a large proportion of patients were hc ##ws . further understanding of the disease transmission and prevention mainly in health care settings are needed .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been responsible for multiple health care – associated outbreak ##s . we investigated whether high - touch surfaces in 3 rooms of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v patients were contaminated with mer ##s - co ##v rna . we found 2 out of 51 surfaces were contaminated with mer ##s - co ##v viral genetic material . hence , environmental contamination may be a potential source of health care transmission and outbreak ##s . met ##ic ##ulous environmental cleaning may be important in preventing transmission within the health care setting .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) en ##code multi ##fu ##nction ##al papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##ses ( pl ##ps ) that have the ability to process the viral poly ##pro ##tein to facilitate rna replication and ant ##ago ##ni ##ze the host innate immune response . the latter function involves rev ##ers ##ing the post - translation ##al modification of cellular proteins con ##ju ##gated with either u ##bi ##qui ##tin ( u ##b ) or u ##b - like inter ##fer ##on - stimulated gene product 15 ( is ##g ##15 ) . u ##b is known to be highly conserved among eu ##kar ##yo ##tes , but surprisingly , is ##g ##15 is highly diver ##gent among animals . the ram ##ification ##s of this sequence diver ##gence to the recognition of is ##g ##15 by corona ##virus pl ##ps at a structural and bio ##chemical level are poorly understood . therefore , the activity of pl ##ps from sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s ‐ co ##v , and mouse hepatitis virus was evaluated against seven is ##g ##15 ##s originating from an assortment of animal species susceptible , and not , to certain corona ##virus infections . exciting ##ly , our kinetic , the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic , and structural analysis revealed an array of different preferences among pl ##ps . included in these studies is the first insight into a corona ##virus pl ##p ’ s interface with is ##g ##15 via sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro in complex with the principle binding domain of human is ##g ##15 ( his ##g ##15 ) and mouse is ##g ##15 ##s ( mis ##g ##15 ##s ) . the first x - ray structure of the full - length mis ##g ##15 protein is also reported and highlights a unique , twisted hi ##nge region of is ##g ##15 that is not conserved in his ##g ##15 , suggesting a potential role in differential recognition . taken together , this new information provides a structural and bio ##chemical understanding of the distinct specific ##ities among corona ##virus pl ##ps observed and addresses a critical gap of how pl ##ps can interact with is ##g ##15 ##s from a wide variety of species .  
abstract the sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) is the main target of the protective immune response in humans and animal models of sar ##s . here , we demonstrated that efficient expression of s from the wild - type spike gene in culture ##d cells required the use of improved pl ##as ##mi ##d vectors containing donor and accept ##or sp ##lice sites , as well as het ##ero ##log ##ous viral rna export elements , such as the ct ##e of ma ##zon - p ##fi ##zer monkey virus or the pre of wood ##chu ##ck hepatitis virus ( w ##pre ) . the presence of both sp ##lice sites and w ##pre markedly improved the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of s - based dna vaccines against sar ##s . upon im ##mun ##ization of mice with low doses ( 2 μ ##g ) of naked dna , only intro ##n and w ##pre - containing vectors could induce neutral ##izing anti - s antibodies and provide protection against challenge with sar ##s - co ##v . our observations are likely to be useful for the construction of pl ##as ##mi ##d and viral vectors designed for optimal expression of intro ##nl ##ess genes derived from cy ##top ##las ##mic rna viruses .  
background the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) infected over 800 ##0 people and killed 77 ##4 . transmission of sar ##s occurred through direct and indirect contact and large drop ##let nuclei . the world health organization recommended the use of household di ##sin ##fect ##ants , which have not been previously tested against sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , to di ##sin ##fect potentially contaminated environmental surfaces . there is a need for a sur ##rogate test system given the limited availability of the sar ##s - co ##v for testing and bio ##sa ##fe ##ty requirements necessary to safely handle it . in this study , the anti ##vira ##l activity of standard household products was ass ##ay ##ed against mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) , as a potential sur ##rogate for sar ##s - co ##v . methods a surface test method , which involves drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the product for a specific contact time , was used to determine the vi ##ru ##ci ##dal activity . the virus ti ##ters and log reductions were determined by the reed and mu ##en ##ch tissue culture in ##fect ##ive dose ( tc ##id ) 50 end point method . results when tested as directed , common household di ##sin ##fect ##ants or anti ##se ##ptic ##s , containing either 0 . 050 % of tri ##cl ##osa ##n , 0 . 12 % of pc ##mx , 0 . 21 % of sodium h ##yp ##och ##lor ##ite , 0 . 23 % of pine oil , or 0 . 10 % of a qu ##ater ##nary compound with 79 % of ethanol , demonstrated a 3 - log reduction or better against m ##h ##v without any virus recovered in a 30 - second contact time . conclusion common household di ##sin ##fect ##ants and anti ##se ##ptic ##s were effective at ina ##ct ##ivating m ##h ##v , a possible sur ##rogate for sar ##s - co ##v , from surfaces when used as directed . in an outbreak caused by novel agents , it is important to know the effectiveness of di ##sin ##fect ##ants and anti ##se ##ptic ##s to prevent or reduce the possibility of human - to - human transmission via surfaces .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a recently reported virus that is associated with severe , life threatening and rapidly spreading primarily respiratory illness called the middle east respiratory syndrome . mer ##s - co ##v possesses a unique positive - sense single - stranded rna and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome . this results in antigen ##ic switching and genetic variation , finally leading to the emergence of novel and new mer ##s - co ##v sub ##type ##s which are un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble by vaccines . researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for mer ##s - co ##v . this virus can spread from human to human , but transmission from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to humans plays a crucial ep ##ide ##mi ##ological significance . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel acts as “ gene mixing vessels ” for mer ##s - co ##v and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them . viral receptors called dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 are important receptors for attachment and spread of mer ##s - co ##v in humans . the current method of laboratory confirmation is through real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction on bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge , sp ##ut ##um and tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates . unfortunately , till today there are no definite anti - viral drugs available for mer ##s - co ##v .  
the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , two strains of animal corona ##virus ##es that crossed the species barrier to in ##fect and cause severe respiratory infections in humans within the last 12 years , have taught us that corona ##virus ##es represent a global threat that does not recognize international borders . we can expect to see other novel corona ##virus ##es emerge in the future . an ideal animal model should reflect the clinical signs , viral replication and pathology seen in humans . in this review , we present factors to consider in establishing an animal model for the study of novel corona ##virus ##es and compare the different animal models that have been employed to study sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v .  
2019 - nc ##ov is a newly identified corona ##virus with high similarity to sar ##s - co ##v . we performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein responsible for entry of corona ##virus ##es into host cells . the rb ##ds from the two viruses share 72 % identity in amino acid sequences , and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ter ##nary structures . however , 2019 - nc ##ov has a distinct loop with flexible g ##ly ##cy ##l residues replacing rigid pro ##ly ##l residues in sar ##s - co ##v . molecular modeling revealed that 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d has a stronger interaction with ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . a unique ph ##en ##yla ##lani ##ne f ##48 ##6 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydro ##phobic pocket in ace ##2 . ace ##2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish , amp ##hi ##bians , reptiles , birds , to mammals . structural analysis suggests that ace ##2 from these animals can potentially bind rb ##d of 2019 - nc ##ov , making them all possible natural hosts for the virus . 2019 - nc ##ov is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets . however , since ace ##2 is predominantly expressed in int ##est ##ines , test ##is , and kidney , fe ##cal - oral and other routes of transmission are also possible . finally , antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ace ##2 with rb ##d should be developed to combat the virus .  
abstract preliminary data examining inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 treatment of sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona virus ) - infected patients suggests this therapy is well tolerated and of therapeutic benefit . we report here ##in that inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 , has potent in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v . in a cy ##top ##athic effect protection ( cp ##e ) ass ##ay , inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 inhibit ##ed the generation of cp ##e in a dose - dependent manner with an ic ##50 of 0 . 001 ##μ ##g / ml , a clinical ##ly ac ##hi ##eva ##ble level . furthermore , inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 also demonstrated significant anti ##vira ##l activity in yield reduction and plaque reduction ass ##ays . the in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity of inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 against sar ##s - co ##v suggests continued evaluation of inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con ##1 as a therapeutic treatment for patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract in september 2012 , a novel corona ##virus was isolated from a patient who died in saudi arabia after presenting with acute respiratory distress and acute kidney injury . analysis revealed the disease to be due to a novel virus which was named middle east respiratory corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . there have been several mer ##s - co ##v hospital outbreak ##s in ks ##a , continuing to the present day , and the disease has a mortality rate in excess of 35 % . since 2012 , the world health organization has been informed of 222 ##0 laboratory - confirmed cases resulting in at least 79 ##0 deaths . cases have since arise ##n in 27 countries , including an outbreak in the republic of korea in 2015 in which 36 people died , but more than 80 % of cases have occurred in saudi arabia . . human - to - human transmission of mer ##s - co ##v , particularly in healthcare settings , initially caused a ‘ media panic ’ , however human - to - human transmission appears to require close contact and thus far the virus has not achieved epidemic potential . zoo ##not ##ic transmission is of significant importance and evidence is growing imp ##lica ##ting the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel as the major animal host in spread of disease to humans . mer ##s - co ##v is now included on the who list of priority blue ##print diseases for which there which is an urgent need for accelerated research and development as they have the potential to cause a public health emergency while there is an absence of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious drugs and / or vaccines . in this review we highlight ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical , and infection control aspects of mer ##s - co ##v as informed by the saudi experience . attention is given to recommended treatments and progress towards vaccine development .  
summary objectives a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like disease due to a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , human corona ##virus em ##c ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) , has emerged recently . hc ##ov - em ##c is phylogenetic ##ally closely related to ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is - bat - corona ##virus - hk ##u ##4 and pip ##ist ##rell ##us - bat - corona ##virus - hk ##u ##5 in hong kong . we conducted a ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce study on archived sera from 94 game - food animal handler ##s at a wild life market , 28 sar ##s patients , and 152 healthy blood donors in southern china to assess the zoo ##not ##ic potential and evidence for intrusion of hc ##ov - em ##c and related viruses into humans . methods anti - hc ##ov - em ##c and anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies were detected using screening indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ( if ) and confirm ##atory neutral ##izing antibody tests . results two ( 2 . 1 % ) animal handler ##s had if antibody ti ##ter of ≥ ##1 : 20 against both hc ##ov - em ##c and sar ##s - co ##v with neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter of < 1 : 10 . no blood donor had antibody against either virus . surprisingly , 17 / 28 ( 60 . 7 % ) of sar ##s patients had significant if antibody ti ##ters with 7 / 28 ( 25 % ) having anti - hc ##ov - em ##c neutral ##izing antibodies at low ti ##ters which significantly correlated with that of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 . bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis demonstrated a significant b - cell ep ##ito ##pe overlapping the he ##pta ##d repeat - 2 region of spike protein . vi ##ru ##lence of sar ##s - co ##v over other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es may boost cross - reactive neutral ##izing antibodies against other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . conclusions con ##vale ##scent sar ##s sera may contain cross - reactive antibodies against other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es and con ##fo ##und ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce study for hc ##ov - em ##c .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe pulmonary infection , with approximately 35 % mortality . spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) of mer ##s - co ##v is a key target for vaccines and therapeutic ##s because s media ##tes viral entry and membrane - fusion to host cells . here , four different s subunit proteins , receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ; 35 ##8 - 60 ##6 aa ) , s ##1 ( 1 - 75 ##1 aa ) , s ##2 ( 75 ##2 - 129 ##6 aa ) , and sd ##elt ##at ##m ( 1 - 129 ##6 aa ) , were generated using the ba ##cu ##lov ##ira ##l system and im ##mun ##ized in mice to develop neutral ##izing antibodies . we developed 77 hybrid ##oma ##s and selected five neutral ##izing mab ##s by im ##mun ##ization with sd ##elt ##at ##m against mer ##s - co ##v em ##c / 2012 strain s - pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##irus . however , all five mab ##s did not neutral ##ize the pseudo ##type ##d v ##53 ##4 ##a mutation . additionally , one mab rb ##d - 14 ##f ##8 did not show neutral ##izing activity against pseudo ##virus ##es with amino acid substitution of l ##50 ##6 f or d ##50 ##9 g ( england ##1 strain , em ##c / 2012 l ##50 ##6 f , and em ##c / 2012 d ##50 ##9 g ) , and rb ##d - 43 ##e ##4 mab could not neutral ##ize the pseudo ##type ##d i ##52 ##9 t mutation , while three other neutral ##izing mab ##s showed broad neutral ##izing activity . this implies that the mutation in residue 50 ##6 - 50 ##9 , 52 ##9 , and 53 ##4 of s is critical to generate neutral ##ization escape variants of mer ##s - co ##v . interesting ##ly , all five neutral ##izing mab ##s have binding affinity to rb ##d , although most mab ##s generated by rb ##d did not have neutral ##izing activity . additionally , chi ##meric antibodies of rb ##d - 14 ##f ##8 and rb ##d - 43 ##e ##4 with human fc and light chain showed neutral ##izing effect against wild type mer ##s - co ##v ko ##r / kn ##ih / 00 ##2 , similar to the original mouse mab ##s . thus , our mab ##s can be utilized for the identification of specific mutations of mer ##s - co ##v .  
the outbreak of 2019 - novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) that is caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread rapidly in china , and has developed to be a public health emergency of international concern . however , no specific anti ##vira ##l treatments or vaccines are available yet . this work aims to share strategies and candidate antigen ##s to develop safe and effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is one of the most promising targets for discovery of drugs against sar ##s , because of its critical role in the viral life cycle . in this study , a natural compound called que ##rce ##tin - 3 - β - gala ##ct ##osi ##de was identified as an inhibitor of the pro ##tea ##se by molecular docking , sp ##r / fr ##et - based bio ##ass ##ays , and mu ##tage ##nes ##is studies . both molecular modeling and q ##18 ##9 ##a mutation revealed that g ##ln ##18 ##9 plays a key role in the binding . furthermore , experimental evidence showed that the secondary structure and en ##zy ##matic activity of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro were not affected by the q ##18 ##9 ##a mutation . with the help of molecular modeling , eight new derivatives of the natural product were designed and synthesized . bio ##ass ##ay results reveal sal ##ient features of the structure – activity relationship of the new compounds : ( 1 ) removal of the 7 - hydro ##xy group of the que ##rce ##tin moi ##ety decreases the bio ##act ##ivity of the derivatives ; ( 2 ) ace ##to ##xy ##lation of the sugar moi ##ety ab ##olis ##hes inhibitor action ; ( 3 ) introduction of a large sugar sub ##sti ##tu ##ent on 7 - hydro ##xy of que ##rce ##tin can be tolerated ; ( 4 ) replacement of the gala ##ct ##ose moi ##ety with other sugar ##s does not affect inhibitor pot ##ency . this study not only reveals a new class of compounds as potential drug leads against the sar ##s virus , but also provides a solid understanding of the mechanism of inhibition against the target enzyme .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have been detected worldwide in several bat species , which are considered the main reservoir . the attention to the high diversity of co ##vs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoo ##not ##ic beta - co ##vs , sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , that cause several respiratory diseases . among corona ##virus ##es , two alpha - co ##v strains ( hu ##co ##v - 229 ##e and hu ##co ##v - nl ##6 ##3 ) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children , elderly and individuals affected by illnesses . phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat alpha - co ##v strains revealed their ev ##ol ##utive correlation to human strains , suggesting their origin in bats . the genome of co ##vs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and rec ##om ##bina ##tion events , increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoo ##not ##ic potential . in this study , three strains of alpha - co ##v genera detected in italian bats ( pip ##ist ##rell ##us ku ##hli ##i ) were fully sequence ##d by next generation sequencing ( ng ##s ) and characterized . the complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the italians strains with a chinese strain detected in 2013 and , based on co ##v molecular species dem ##ar ##cation , two new alpha - co ##v species were established . the analysis of a fragment of the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) showed the correlation of the italian strains with co ##vs that was only detected in the bat pip ##ist ##rell ##us genera ( pip ##ist ##rell ##us ku ##hli ##i and pip ##ist ##rell ##us pip ##ist ##rell ##us ) in european countries .  
abstract ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore - based virtual screening is an effective , inexpensive and fast approach to discovering useful starting points for drug discovery . in this study , we developed a ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore model for the main protein ##ase of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . then we used this ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore model to search nc ##i 3d database including 250 , 251 compounds and identified 30 existing drugs containing the ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore query . among them are six compounds that already exhibited anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity experimental ##ly . this means that our ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore model can lead to the discovery of potent anti - sar ##s - co ##v inhibitors or promising lead compounds for further sar ##s - co ##v main protein ##ase inhibitor development .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) able to in ##fect humans emerge through cross - host transmission from animals . there is substantial evidence that the recent middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v outbreak is fueled by zoo ##not ##ic transmission from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . this is largely based on the fact that closely related viruses have been isolated from this but not any other animal species . given the widespread geographical distribution of dr ##ome ##dar ##ies found ser ##op ##osi ##tive for mer ##s - co ##v , continued transmission may likely occur in the future . therefore , a further understanding of the cross host transmission of mer ##s - co ##v is needed to limit the risks this virus poses to man .  
abstract emerging life threatening pathogen ##s such as severe acute as ##pi ##rator ##y syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , av ##ian - origin influenza ##s h ##7 ##n ##9 , and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have caused a high case - fatal ##ity rate and psychological effects on society and the economy . therefore , a simple , rapid , and safe method to investigate a therapeutic approach against these pathogen ##s is required . in this study , a simple , quick , and safe cell ad ##hesion inhibition ass ##ay was developed to determine the potential cellular binding site on the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein . various synthetic peptide ##s covering the potential binding site helped to minimize further the binding motif to 10 – 25 residues . following analyses , 2 peptide ##s spanning the 43 ##6 – 44 ##5 and 43 ##7 – 46 ##1 amino acids of the spike protein were identified as peptide inhibitor or peptide vaccine candidates against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract little is known about cd ##4 + t - cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus . in two sar ##s patients , we examined the memory cd ##4 + t - cell responses to peptide ##s derived from sar ##s corona ##virus structural proteins . we generated cd ##4 + t - cell lines to 3 peptide ##s from the spike ( s ) protein and defined their h ##la restriction . in one patient , the predominant memory cd ##4 + t - cell response was directed against an ep ##ito ##pe outside the s protein receptor - binding domain . in both patients , the frequency of cd ##4 + memory t - cells to virus structural proteins and anti - sar ##s corona ##virus i ##gg levels were low by 12 months after infection . this report expands our understanding of the specific ##ity and duration of anti - sar ##s corona ##virus cd ##4 + t - cell immune responses .  
abstract sar ##s 8 ##b is one of the put ##ative accessory proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) with unknown functions . in this study , the cellular local ##ization and activity of this estimated 9 . 6 ##k ##da protein were examined . con ##fo ##cal microscopy results indicated that sar ##s 8 ##b is localized in both nucleus and cy ##top ##las ##m of mammalian cells . functional study revealed that over ##ex ##press ##ion of sar ##s 8 ##b induced dna synthesis . coe ##x ##press ##ion of sar ##s 8 ##b and sar ##s 6 , a previously characterized sar ##s - co ##v accessory protein , did not eli ##cit syn ##er ##gist ##ic effects on dna synthesis .  
abstract sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans and in vitro models of the lung are needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te cellular targets and the consequences of viral infection . the severe and sudden onset of symptoms , resulting in an at ##yp ##ical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of corona ##virus ##es as potentially lethal human pathogen ##s and the identification of several zoo ##not ##ic reservoirs has made the re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of new strains and future epidemic ##s all the more possible . in this chapter , we describe the pathology of sar ##s - co ##v infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting air ##way to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v in relevant in vitro systems . the first culture model is a human bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cell line cal ##u - 3 that can be in ##oc ##ulated by viruses either as a non - polar ##ized mono ##layer of cells or polar ##ized cells with tight junctions and micro ##vill ##i . the second model system , derived from primary cells isolated from human air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um and grown on trans ##well ##s , form a pseudo ##stra ##ti ##fied mu ##co ##ci ##lia ##ry ep ##ith ##eli ##um that rec ##ap ##it ##ulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting air ##way in vivo . experimental results using these lung ep ##ith ##elial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##s to high ti ##ters in ep ##ith ##elial cells of the conducting air ##way . the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , human ang ##iot ##ens ##in 1 converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) , was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 cells and human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cultures ( ha ##e ) , indicating that ha ##ce ##2 was accessible by sar ##s - co ##v after lu ##men ##al air ##way delivery . furthermore , in ha ##e , ha ##ce ##2 was exclusively localized to ci ##lia ##ted air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . in support of the ha ##ce ##2 local ##ization data , the most productive route of in ##oc ##ulation and pro ##geny vi ##rion e ##gre ##ss in both polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 and ci ##lia ##ted cells of ha ##e was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lu ##men of the human lung . pre ##in ##cu ##bation of the apical surface of cultures with anti ##ser ##a directed against ha ##ce ##2 reduced viral ti
abstract the international response to sar ##s - co ##v has produced an outstanding number of protein structures in a very short time . this review sum ##mar ##izes the findings of functional and structural studies including those derived from cry ##oe ##le ##ct ##ron microscopy , small angle x - ray scattering , nm ##r spectroscopy , and x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy , and incorporates bio ##in ##form ##atics predictions where no structural data is available . structures that shed light on the function and biological roles of the proteins in viral replication and pathogen ##esis are highlighted . the high percentage of novel protein folds identified among sar ##s - co ##v proteins is discussed .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first described in september 2012 and to date 86 deaths from a total of 206 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection have been reported to the who . camel ##s have been implicated as the reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v , but the exact source and mode of transmission for most patients remain unknown . during a 3 month period , june to august 2013 , there were 12 positive mer ##s - co ##v cases reported from the ha ##fr al - bat ##in region district in the north east region of the kingdom of saudi arabia . in addition to the different regional camel festivals in neighboring countries , ha ##fr al - bat ##in has the biggest camel market in the entire kingdom and hosts an annual camel festival . thus , we conducted a detailed ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical and gen ##omic study to as ##cer ##tain common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of mer ##s - co ##v reported from ha ##fr al - bat ##in . analysis of previously reported genetic data indicated that at least two of the infected contacts could not have been directly infected from the index patient and alternate source should be considered . while camel ##s appear as the likely source , other sources have not been ruled out . more detailed case control studies with detailed case histories , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information and gen ##omic analysis are being conducted to del ##ine ##ate the missing pieces in the transmission dynamics of mer ##s - co ##v outbreak .  
abstract the corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is a public health emergency of international concern . however , so far , there are still controversies about the source of the virus and its intermediate host . here , we found the novel corona ##virus was closely related to corona ##virus ##es derived from five wild animals , including pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta , paradox ##urus her ##ma ##ph ##rod ##it ##us , ci ##vet , as ##elli ##scu ##s st ##olic ##z ##kan ##us and rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus , and was in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree . however , genome and or ##f ##1 ##a homo ##logy show that the virus is not the same corona ##virus as the corona ##virus derived from these five animals , whereas the virus has the highest homo ##logy with bat corona ##virus isolate rat ##g ##13 .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein could be detected easily using western b ##lot ##ting in non - den ##at ##uring condition but not regular den ##at ##uring treatment . boiling treatment , causing the aggregation of sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein in the stack ##ing gel ##s , results in the failure to detect the membrane protein in the separating gel ##s . aggregate ##d membrane proteins could not be di ##sso ##cia ##ted by 1 % tri ##ton - x 100 , 6 ##m ur ##ea , or 2 % sd ##s . the region with amino acid residues from 51 to 170 is responsible for thermal aggregation of sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein . hydro ##phobic regions with amino acid residues from 61 to 90 , from 91 to 100 , from 136 to 170 , are essential for this protein aggregation . thermal aggregation of sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein is not unique among structural proteins of corona ##virus ##es . however , sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein seems to be more sensitive to heat treatment , since the membrane protein of m ##h ##v - j ##hm , another member of the corona ##vir ##idae , would not aggregate after the same treatment . therefore , if sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein needs to be analyzed using sd ##s - page , boiling should be avoided . thermal aggregation of sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein may be one of the reasons for the ina ##ct ##ivation of this virus by heat . the unusual property of sar ##s - co ##v membrane protein aggregation induced by heat also provides a model for the study of protein aggregation .  
abstract background the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has prompted enhanced surveillance for respiratory infections among pilgrims returning from the ha ##j ##j , one of the largest annual mass gatherings in the world . objectives to describe the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and et ##iol ##og ##ies of respiratory illnesses among pilgrims returning to jordan after the 2014 ha ##j ##j . study design surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to jordan after the 2014 ha ##j ##j was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogen ##s , including mer ##s - co ##v . results among the 125 subjects , 58 % tested positive for at least one virus ; 47 % tested positive for rhino / enter ##ov ##irus . no cases of mer ##s - co ##v were detected . conclusions the majority of pilgrims returning to jordan from the 2014 ha ##j ##j with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral et ##iology , but none were due to mer ##s - co ##v . a greater understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of acute respiratory infections among returning travelers to other countries after ha ##j ##j should help opt ##imi ##ze surveillance systems and inform public health response practices .  
abstract a new type of corona ##virus has been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent underlying middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has spread in the middle east , but cases originating in the middle east have also occurred in the european union and the usa . eight hundred and thirty - seven cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection have been confirmed to date , including 291 deaths . mer ##s - co ##v has infected dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel populations in the middle east at high rates , representing an immediate source of human infection . the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein , a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope , is considered as a key target of vaccines against corona ##virus infection . in an initial attempt to develop a mer ##s - co ##v vaccine to ultimately target dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , we constructed two rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##ira ##l vectors encoding the full - length mer ##s - co ##v s protein ( ad ##5 . mer ##s - s ) and the s ##1 extra ##cellular domain of s protein ( ad ##5 . mer ##s - s ##1 ) . bal ##b / c mice were im ##mun ##ized with both candidate vaccines intra ##mus ##cular ##ly and boosted three weeks later intra ##nas ##ally . all the va ##cci ##nated animals had antibody responses against spike protein , which neutral ##ized mer ##s - co ##v in vitro . these results show that an aden ##ov ##ira ##l - based vaccine can induce mer ##s - co ##v - specific immune responses in mice and hold promise for the development of a prevent ##ive vaccine that targets the animal reservoir , which might be an effective measure to eliminate transmission of mer ##s - co ##v to humans .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) are the most severe corona ##virus ( co ##v ) - associated diseases in humans . the ca ##usa ##tive agents , sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , are of zoo ##not ##ic origin but may be transmitted to humans , causing severe and often fatal respiratory disease in their new host . the two corona ##virus ##es are thought to en ##code an unusually large number of factors that allow them to thrive and replicate in the presence of efficient host defense mechanisms , especially the anti ##vira ##l inter ##fer ##on system . here , we review the recent progress in our understanding of the strategies that highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es employ to escape , damp ##en , or block the anti ##vira ##l inter ##fer ##on response in human cells .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) were first described in the 1960s for patients with the common cold . since then , more hc ##ov ##s have been discovered , including those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , two pathogen ##s that , upon infection , can cause fatal respiratory disease in humans . it was recently discovered that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in saudi arabia harbor three different hc ##ov species , including a dominant mer ##s hc ##ov lineage that was responsible for the outbreak ##s in the middle east and south korea during 2015 . in this review we aim to compare and contrast the different hc ##ov ##s with regard to ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and pathogen ##esis , in addition to the virus evolution and rec ##om ##bina ##tion events which have , on occasion , resulted in outbreak ##s amongst humans .  
abstract infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is initiated by specific interactions between the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein and its receptor ace ##2 . in this report , we screened a peptide library representing the sar ##s - co ##v s protein sequence using a human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus - based pseudo ##ty ##ping system to identify specific regions that affect viral entry . one of the 169 peptide ##s screened , peptide 96 ##26 ( s residues 217 – 234 ) , inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v s - mediated entry of the pseudo ##type ##d vi ##rion ##s in 293 ##t cells expressing a functional sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ) in a dose - dependent manner ( ic ##50 [UNK] μ ##m ) . alan ##ine scanning mu ##tage ##nes ##is was performed to assess the roles of individual residues within this region of s , which was previously un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized . the effects included significant reductions in expression ( k ##22 ##3 ##a ) , viral incorporation ( l ##21 ##8 ##a , i ##23 ##0 ##a , and n ##23 ##2 ##a ) , and reduced viral entry ( l ##22 ##4 ##a , l ##22 ##6 ##a , i ##22 ##8 ##a , t ##23 ##1 ##a , and f ##23 ##3 ##a ) . taken together , these results reveal a new region of the s protein that is crucial for sar ##s - co ##v entry .  
abstract to combat the public health threat from emerging corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) , the development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies with either virus - specific or pan - corona ##vira ##l activities is necessary . an important step in anti ##vira ##l drug development is the screening of potential inhibitors in cell - based systems . the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) nec ##ess ##itate ##s adapting methods that have been used to identify anti ##vira ##ls against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and developing new approaches to more efficiently screen anti ##vira ##l drugs . in this article we review cell - based ass ##ays using infectious virus ( bs ##l - 3 ) and sur ##rogate ass ##ays ( bs ##l - 2 ) that can be implemented to accelerate anti ##vira ##l development against mer ##s - co ##v and future emerge ##nt corona ##virus ##es . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ” 
abstract when unexpected diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and av ##ian influenza become a serious threat to public health , an immediate response is imperative . this should take into consideration existing licensed anti ##vira ##l drugs against other viral diseases already known to be safe for use in humans . in this report , evidence is presented that hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors ( pi ##s ) currently used in anti - hiv - 1 the ##ra ##pies might ex ##ert some effects on sar ##s and perhaps , on av ##ian influenza . evidence for the potential benefits of pi ##s against the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is provided by empirical clinical studies , in vivo viral inhibition ass ##ays and computational simulations of the docking of these compounds to the active site of the main sar ##s - co ##v pro ##tea ##se . as suggested by in si ##lic ##o docking of these molecules to a theoretical model of a subunit of type a influenza virus rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase , there also exists a remote possibility that these pi ##s may have an effect on av ##ian influenza viruses . although this evidence is still far from being definitive , the results so far obtained suggest that pi ##s should be seriously taken into consideration for further testing as potential therapeutic agents for sar ##s and av ##ian influenza .  
abstract the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v . similar to other corona ##virus ##es , spike ( s ) - g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of the virus interact ##s with a cellular receptor and media ##tes membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells . accordingly , s - protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutral ##izing antibodies . to begin to understand its bio ##chemical and im ##mun ##ological properties , we expressed both full - length and ec ##to ##dom ##ain of the protein in various primate cells . our results show that the protein has an electro ##ph ##ore ##tic mobility of about 160 – 170 k ##da . the protein is g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted with high mann ##ose and / or hybrid ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des , which account for approximately 30 k ##da of the apparent protein mass . the detection of s - protein by im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys was difficult using human con ##vale ##scent sera , suggesting that the protein may not eli ##cit strong humor ##al immune response in virus - infected patients . we were able to pseudo ##type mu ##rine leukemia virus particles with s - protein and produce sar ##s pseudo ##virus ##es . pseudo ##virus ##es infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells in a ph - independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibit ##ed by con ##vale ##scent sera . consistent with low levels of antibodies against s - protein , neutral ##izing activity was weak with 50 % neutral ##ization ti ##ters ranging between 1 : 15 to 1 : 25 . to facilitate quan ##tify ##ing pseudo ##virus - infected cells , which are stained blue with x - gal , we devised an automated procedure using an eli ##sp ##ot analyze ##r . the high - through ##put capacity of this procedure and the safety of using sar ##s pseudo ##virus ##es should make possible large - scale analyses of neutral ##izing antibody responses against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a major vi ##rion structural protein . it plays an important role in interaction with receptor and inducing neutral ##izing antibodies . in the study , six tentative antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes ( s ##1 s ##2 s ##3 s ##4 s ##5 s ##6 ) of the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v were predicted by bio - inform ##atics analysis , and a multi - ep ##ito ##pe chi ##meric gene of s ##1 – s ##2 – s ##3 – s ##4 – s ##5 – s ##6 was synthesized and fused to downstream gs ##t gene in pg ##ex - 6 ##p - 1 . the western b ##lot ##ting demonstrated that sar ##s patient con ##vale ##scent serum could recognize the rec ##om ##bina ##nt fusion protein . a number of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies were developed against the fusion protein . in further , the six predicted ep ##ito ##pe genes were individually fused to gs ##t of pg ##ex - 6 ##p - 1 and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli b ##l ##21 , respectively . among six fusion peptide ##s , s ##5 reacted with mono ##cl ##onal antibody d ##3 ##c ##5 and s ##2 reacted with mono ##cl ##onal antibody d ##3d ##1 against spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v . the ep ##ito ##pes recognized by mono ##cl ##onal antibodies d ##3 ##c ##5 and d ##3d ##1 are linear , and correspond to 44 ##7 – 45 ##8 and 78 ##9 – 79 ##9 amino acids of spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v , respectively . identification of antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pe of spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v could provide the basis for the development of immunity - based prop ##hyl ##actic , therapeutic , and diagnostic techniques for the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome .  
abstract to analyze the proteins interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) envelope ( e ) protein , a sar ##s - co ##v was engineered including two tags associated to the e protein . using this virus , complexes of sar ##s - co ##v e and other proteins were pu ##rified using a tandem affinity purification system . several viral and cell proteins including spike , membrane , non - structural protein 3 ( ns ##p ##3 ) , d ##yne ##in heavy chain , fatty acid synth ##ase and trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein 43 bound e protein . in the present work , we focused on the binding of e protein to ns ##p ##3 in infected cells and cell - free systems . this interaction was mediated by the n - terminal acidic domain of ns ##p ##3 . moreover , ns ##p ##3 and e protein col ##oca ##lized during the infection . it was shown that e protein was u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##ted in vitro and in cell culture , suggesting that the interaction between ns ##p ##3 and e protein may play a role in the e protein u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion status and therefore on its turnover .  
summary this article describes the path ##ological studies of fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in a 73 - year - old man during an outbreak of sar ##s in taiwan , 2003 . eight days before onset of symptoms , he visited a municipal hospital that was later identified as the epic ##enter of a large outbreak of sar ##s . on admission to national taiwan university hospital in taipei , the patient experienced chest tight ##ness , progressive d ##ys ##p ##nea , and low - grade fever . his condition rapidly deteriorated with increasing respiratory difficulty , and he died 7 days after admission . the most prominent his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic finding was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage of the lung . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical and in situ hybrid ##ization ass ##ays demonstrated evidence of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection in various respiratory ep ##ith ##elial cells , predominantly type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , and in al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges in the lung . electron microscopic examination also revealed corona ##virus particles in the p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , and their identity was confirmed as sar ##s - co ##v by im ##mun ##ogo ##ld labeling electron microscopy . this report is the first to describe the cellular local ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v in human lung tissue by using a combination of im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry , double - stain im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry , in situ hybrid ##ization , electron microscopy , and im ##mun ##ogo ##ld labeling electron microscopy . these techniques represent valuable laboratory diagnostic mod ##ali ##ties and provide insights into the pathogen ##esis of this emerging infection .  
background : the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) first broke out in wu ##han ( china ) and subsequently spread worldwide . ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e has been sporadic ##ally used in treating sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e shares the same mechanism of action as ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , but its more to ##ler ##able safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and auto ##im ##mun ##e conditions . we propose that the im ##mun ##omo ##du ##lat ##ory effect of hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e also may be useful in controlling the cy ##tok ##ine storm that occurs late - phase in critically ill sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected patients . currently , there is no evidence to support the use of hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods : the ph ##arm ##aco ##logical activity of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e and hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e was tested using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected ve ##ro cells . physiological ##ly - based ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic models ( p ##b ##p ##k ) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data . using the p ##b ##p ##k models , hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dos ##ing regime ##ns to explore the most effective regime ##n whilst considering the drug ’ s safety profile . results : hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( ec ( 50 ) = 0 . 72 μ ##m ) was found to be more potent than ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( ec ( 50 ) = 5 . 47 μ ##m ) in vitro . based on p ##b ##p ##k models results , a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e sulfate given oral ##ly , followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , as it reached three times the pot ##ency of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance . conclusions : hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e was found to be more potent than ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in vitro .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are enveloped , positive - strand rna viruses with characteristic spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s that project outward like the rays of the sun ( corona – latin for ‘ crown ’ ) , when visual ##ized by electron microscopy . co ##v are classified , together with the toro ##virus ##es , in the family corona ##vir ##idae and the order ni ##do ##vira ##les . all ni ##do ##virus ##es have a common genome organization and generate a nest ##ed set ( ni ##do – latin for ‘ nest ’ ) of 3 ′ co - terminal mrna ##s . co ##vs have been isolated from a variety of species , including birds , livestock , domestic animals , and humans . co ##v infections can cause respiratory , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal , and ne ##uro ##logic disease , depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection . importantly , co ##vs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to in ##fect humans and cause severe disease . the co ##v responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 – 03 likely originated as a bat corona ##virus which , during replication in an intermediate host ( such as the palm ci ##vet ) , evolved to be able to in ##fect humans efficiently . sar ##s - co ##v infected over 800 ##0 people with approximately 10 % mortality rate . the sar ##s - co ##v outbreak was controlled by public health measures alone . however , emergence or re - emergence of co ##v from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is the second novel zoo ##not ##ic disease in ##fect ##ing humans caused by corona ##virus ( co ##v ) in this century . to date , more than 220 ##0 laboratory - confirmed human cases have been identified in 27 countries , and more than 800 mer ##s - co ##v associated deaths have been reported since its outbreak in 2012 . rapid laboratory diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread of infection . though the gold standard for dia ##gno ##sing mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans is still nuclei ##c acid amp ##li ##fication test ( na ##at ) of the up - e region , an antigen capture enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) could also be of use for early diagnosis in less developed locations . in the present method , a step - by - step guide to perform a mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) capture elisa using two np - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies is provided for readers to develop their in - house work ##flow or diagnostic kit for clinical use and for mass - screening project of animals ( e . g . , dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and bats ) to better understand the spread and evolution of the virus .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is continuously spreading and causing severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans . prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to control mer ##s - co ##v infection . here , we generated a human ##ized mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) , designated hms - 1 , which targeted the mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) with high affinity . hms - 1 significantly blocked mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d binding to its viral receptor , human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) , potent ##ly neutral ##ized infection by a prototype mer ##s - co ##v , and effectively cross - neutral ##ized evolved mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s through recognizing highly conserved rb ##d ep ##ito ##pes . notably , single - dose treatment with hms - 1 completely protected hd ##pp ##4 trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g ) mice from lethal infection with mer ##s - co ##v . taken together , our data suggest that hms - 1 might be developed as an effective im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##c agent to treat patients infected with mer ##s - co ##v , particularly in emerge ##nt cases .  
the outbreak of a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) represents a pan ##de ##mic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern . the co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is a key target for vaccines , therapeutic antibodies , and diagnostic ##s . to facilitate medical counter ##me ##as ##ure development , we determined a 3 . 5 - ang ##strom - resolution cry ##o – electron microscopy structure of the 2019 - nc ##ov s trim ##er in the pre ##fusion conform ##ation . the predominant state of the trim ##er has one of the three receptor - binding domains ( rb ##ds ) rotated up in a receptor - accessible conform ##ation . we also provide bio ##physical and structural evidence that the 2019 - nc ##ov s protein binds ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v s . additionally , we tested several published sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and found that they do not have app ##re ##cia ##ble binding to 2019 - nc ##ov s , suggesting that antibody cross - react ##ivity may be limited between the two rb ##ds . the structure of 2019 - nc ##ov s should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical counter ##me ##as ##ures to address the ongoing public health crisis .  
summary purpose emergency department ( ed ) nurses suffer from persistent stress after experiencing the traumatic event of exposure to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which can subsequently lead to burn ##out . this study aimed to assess ed nurses ' burn ##out level during an outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burn ##out . methods study participants were ed nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients in korea . we performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burn ##out . results the ed nurses ' burn ##out was affected by job stress ( β = 0 . 59 , p < . 001 ) , poor hospital resources for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v ( β = − ##0 . 19 , p < . 001 ) and poor support from family and friends ( β = − ##0 . 14 , p < . 05 ) . these three variables explained 47 . 3 % of the variance in burn ##out . conclusions ed nurses taking care of mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients should be aware that burn ##out is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments and that job stress is the biggest influential factor of burn ##out . to be ready for the outbreak of emerging con ##tag ##ious diseases such as mer ##s - co ##v , efforts and preparations should be made to reduce burn ##out . job stress should be managed and resolved . working conditions for mit ##iga ##ting job stress and systematic stress management programs should be provided , and hospital resources for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v need to be reinforced . moreover , promoting support from family and friends is required .  
the multiple ##x polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) technique was applied to detect the sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ) specific target cd ##na fragments in the present study . the target cd ##na fragments of sar ##s - co ##v were synthesized artificial ##ly according to the genome sequence of sar ##s - co ##v in gen ##bank submitted by the chinese university of hong kong , and were used as simulated positive samples . five prime ##rs recommended by world health organization ( who ) were used to amp ##li ##fy the fragments by single pc ##r and multiple ##x pc ##r . three target cd ##na fragments ( 121 , 182 and 302 bp ) , as well as the three different combinations of any two of these fragments , were amplified by single pc ##r . the combination of these three fragments was amplified by multiple ##x pc ##r . the results indicated that the multiple ##x pc ##r technique could be applied to detect the sar ##s - co ##v specific target cd ##na fragments successfully .  
abstract there is a global need to el ##uc ##ida ##te protective antigen ##s expressed by the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . mono ##cl ##onal antibody re ##age ##nts that recognise specific antigen ##s on sar ##s - co ##v are needed urgently . in this report , the development and im ##mun ##oche ##mic ##al character ##isation of a panel of mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against the sar ##s - co ##v is presented , based upon their specific ##ity , binding requirements , and biological activity . initial screening by elisa , using highly pu ##rified virus as the coating antigen , resulted in the selection of 103 ##ma ##bs to the sar ##s virus . subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen i ##gg mab ##s . a single mab , f ##26 ##g ##15 , is specific for the nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein as seen in western im ##mun ##ob ##lot while five other mab ##s react with the spike protein . two of these spike - specific mab ##s demonstrate the ability to neutral ##ise sar ##s - co ##v in vitro while another four western im ##mun ##ob ##lot - negative mab ##s also neutral ##ise the virus . the utility of these mab ##s for diagnostic development is demonstrated . antibody from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients , but not normal human serum , is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mab ##s to whole sar ##s - co ##v . these studies highlight the importance of using standard ##ised ass ##ays and re ##age ##nts . these mab ##s will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests , studies of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and vaccine development .  
abstract a novel corona ##virus , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s . the profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the virus is critical to the development of vaccine and diagnostic tools . in this study , 13 rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins associated with four structural proteins ( s , e , m and n ) and five put ##ative un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized proteins ( 3a , 3 ##b , 6 , 7 ##a and 9 ##b ) of the sar ##s - co ##v were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific i ##gg antibodies in sar ##s patient sera by protein micro ##ar ##ray . antibodies to proteins s , 3a , n and 9 ##b were detected in the sera from con ##vale ##scent - phase sar ##s patients , whereas those to proteins e , m , 3 ##b , 6 and 7 ##a were und ##ete ##cted . in the detect ##able specific antibodies , anti - s and anti - n were dominant and could persist in the sera of sar ##s patients until week 30 . among the rabbit anti ##ser ##a to rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins s ##3 , n , 3a and 9 ##b , only anti - s ##3 serum showed significant neutral ##izing activity to the sar ##s - co ##v infection in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . the results suggest ( 1 ) that anti - s and anti - n antibodies are diagnostic markers and in particular that s ##3 is im ##mun ##ogenic and therefore is a good candidate as a subunit vaccine antigen ; and ( 2 ) that , from a virus structure viewpoint , the presence in some human sera of antibodies reacting with two rec ##om ##bina ##nt poly ##pe ##pt ##ides , 3a and 9 ##b , supports the hypothesis that they are synthesized during the virus cycle .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a serious infectious threat to public health . to create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its pot ##ency , we attempted to generate a sar ##s inactivated vaccine using sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strain f ##6 ##9 treated with formal ##deh ##yde and mixed with al ( oh ) 3 . three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of bal ##b / c mice . we found that the mice exhibited specific i ##gm on day 4 and i ##gg on day 8 . the peak ti ##ters of i ##gg were at day 47 in low - dose group ( 1 : 19 , 200 ) and high - dose group ( 1 : 38 , 400 ) whereas in middle - dose group ( 1 : 19 , 200 ) , the peak was at day 40 . on day 63 , the i ##gg levels reached a plateau . neutral ##ization ass ##ay demonstrated that the anti ##ser ##a could protect ve ##ro - e ##6 cells from sar ##s - co ##v ' s infection . analysis of the antibody specific ##ity revealed that the mouse anti ##ser ##a contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , the mouse anti ##ser ##a conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein n , poly ##pe ##pt ##ide s ##4 and s ##2 than those of proteins m and 3 ##cl . these findings suggest that the inactivated sar ##s - co ##v could preserve its antigen ##ici ##ty and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutral ##ization activity . results also suggest that poly ##pe ##pt ##ides originating from protein n or s might be a potential target for the generation of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s vaccine .  
summary the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a lethal zoo ##not ##ic pathogen that was first identified in humans in saudi arabia and jordan in 2012 . intermittent sporadic cases , community clusters , and nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v continue to occur . between april 2012 and december 2019 , 249 ##9 laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection , including 85 ##8 deaths ( 34 · 3 % mortality ) were reported from 27 countries to who , the majority of which were reported by saudi arabia ( 210 ##6 cases , 780 deaths ) . large outbreak ##s of human - to - human transmission have occurred , the largest in ri ##yad ##h and jed ##dah in 2014 and in south korea in 2015 . mer ##s - co ##v remains a high - threat pathogen identified by who as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate , epidemic potential , and no medical counter ##me ##as ##ures . this seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on mer ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , vi ##rol ##ogy , mode of transmission , pathogen ##esis , diagnosis , clinical features , management , infection control , development of new therapeutic ##s and vaccines , and highlights una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions and priorities for research , improved management , and prevention .  
abstract ever since the discovery of sar ##s - co ##v in the year 2003 , numerous researchers around the world have been working relentless ##ly to understand the biology of this virus . as in other corona ##virus ##es , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) is one of the most crucial structural components of the sar ##s - co ##v . hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein . independent studies conducted by several laboratories have el ##uc ##ida ##ted significant insight into the primary function of this protein , which is to en ##cap ##si ##date the viral genome . in addition , many reports also suggest that this protein interfere ##s with different cellular pathways , thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too . in the first part of this review , we will discuss these different properties of the n - protein in a consolidated manner . further , this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the sar ##s - co ##v . hence , towards the end of this article , we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinical ##ly relevant use of the n - protein .  
abstract a double - inactivated , candidate whole virus vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was developed and manufactured at large scale using fe ##rm ##enter cultures of serum protein free ve ##ro cells . a two step ina ##ct ##ivation procedure involving sequential formal ##deh ##yde and u . v . ina ##ct ##ivation was ut ##ilised in order to ensure an extremely high safety margin with respect to residual in ##fect ##ivity . the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of this double - inactivated vaccine was characterised in the mouse model . mice that were im ##mun ##ised twice with the candidate sar ##s - co ##v vaccine developed high antibody ti ##tres against the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein and high levels of neutral ##ising antibodies . the use of the ad ##ju ##vant al ( oh ) 3 had only a minor effect on the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of the vaccine . in addition , cell mediated immunity as measured by inter ##fer ##on - γ and inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 stimulation , was eli ##cite ##d by va ##cci ##nation . moreover , the vaccine con ##fers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of sar ##s - co ##v replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intra ##nas ##al challenge with sar ##s - co ##v . protection of mice was correlated to antibody ti ##tre against the sar ##s - co ##v s protein and neutral ##ising antibody ti ##tre .  
abstract we describe here the design , synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of molecules toward the development of novel pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . a docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro motivated the replacement of a th ##ia ##zo ##le with a benz ##oth ##ia ##zo ##le unit as a war ##head moi ##ety at the p ##1 ′ site . this modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives , including 2 ##i , 2 ##k , 2 ##m , 2 ##o , and 2 ##p , with ic ##50 or k i values in the sub ##mic ##rom ##olar to nano ##mo ##lar range . in particular , compounds 2 ##i and 2 ##p exhibited the most potent inhibitor ##y activities , with k i values of 4 . 1 and 3 . 1 ##n ##m , respectively . the pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against sar ##s . the structural requirements of the pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tics with potent inhibitor ##y activities against sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro may be summarized as follows : ( i ) the presence of a benz ##oth ##ia ##zo ##le war ##head at the s ##1 ′ - position ; ( ii ) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lac ##tam of the s ##1 - site ; ( iii ) appropriate stereo ##chemist ##ry and hydro ##phobic moi ##ety size at the s ##2 - site and ( iv ) a unique folding conform ##ation assumed by the ph ##eno ##xy ##ace ##ty ##l moi ##ety at the s ##4 - site .  
in december 2019 , a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) epidemic , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus – 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) emerged from china . this virus causes the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . since then , there have been an ##ec ##dot ##al reports of o ##cular infection . the o ##cular implications of human co ##v infections have not been widely studied . however , co ##vs have been known to cause various o ##cular infections in animals . clinical entities such as con ##jun ##ct ##iv ##itis , anterior uv ##eit ##is , re ##tin ##itis , and optic ne ##uri ##tis have been documented in fe ##line and mu ##rine models . in this article , the current evidence suggesting possible human co ##v infection of o ##cular tissue is reviewed . the review article will also highlight animal co ##vs and their associated o ##cular infections . we hope that this article will serve as a start for further research into the o ##cular implications of human co ##v infections .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , spread largely via droplets . patients present with rapidly progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure . diagnosis requires the demonstration of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link ##age , clinical profiles , and vi ##rol ##ogical evidence of sar ##s - co ##v infection . treatment of sar ##s is largely an ##ec ##dot ##al . high - dose co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid therapy might be useful for critically ill patients , but previous use of rib ##avi ##rin ( a broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l agent ) was probably not e ##ffi ##ca ##cious . some survivors of sar ##s suffer from ava ##scu ##lar nec ##rosis of hip and knee joints . poor pro ##gno ##stic factors include advanced age , como ##rb ##idi ##ties , and high serum lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil levels .  
abstract since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) to date , neither an effective anti ##vira ##l drug nor a vaccine against sar ##s is available . however , it was found that a mixture of two hiv - 1 protein ##ase inhibitors , lo ##pina ##vir and ri ##ton ##avi ##r , exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the sar ##s virus . to understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these protein ##ase inhibitors and the sar ##s virus via complex ##ation , molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro free enzyme ( free sar ##s ) and its complexes with lo ##pina ##vir ( sar ##s – lp ##v ) and ri ##ton ##avi ##r ( sar ##s – rt ##v ) . the results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . the binding af ##fin ##ities of lp ##v and rt ##v to sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro do not show any significant difference . in addition , six hydrogen bonds were detected in the sar ##s – lp ##v system , while seven hydrogen bonds were found in sar ##s – rt ##v complex .  
summary background severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel infectious disease with global impact . a virus from the family corona ##vir ##idae has been identified as the cause , but the pathogen ##esis is still unclear . methods post - mort ##em tissue samples from six patients who died from sar ##s in february and march , 2003 , and an open lung bio ##psy from one of these patients were studied by his ##tology and vi ##rol ##ogy . only one full autopsy was done . evidence of infection with the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus was sought by reverse - transcript ##ase pc ##r and ser ##ology . path ##ological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry . findings all six patients had ser ##ological evidence of recent infection with sar ##s - co ##v . diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage was common but not universal . morphological changes identified were bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial den ##uda ##tion , loss of ci ##lia , and sq ##ua ##mous meta ##pl ##asia . secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case . a giant - cell infiltrate was seen in four patients , with a pronounced increase in macro ##pha ##ges in the al ##ve ##oli and the inter ##sti ##tium of the lung . ha ##em ##op ##ha ##go ##cy ##tosis was present in two patients . the al ##ve ##olar p ##ne ##um ##ocytes also showed cy ##tom ##ega ##ly with gran ##ular amp ##hop ##hil ##ic cy ##top ##las ##m . the patient for whom full autopsy was done had at ##rop ##hy of the white pulp of the sp ##leen . electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cy ##top ##las ##m of ep ##ith ##elial cells corresponding to corona ##virus . interpretation sar ##s is associated with ep ##ith ##elial - cell proliferation and an increase in macro ##pha ##ges in the lung . the presence of ha ##em ##op ##ha ##go ##cy ##tosis supports the contention that cy ##tok ##ine d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation may account , at least partly , for the severity of the clinical disease . the case definition of sar ##s should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease . published online may 16 , 2003 http : / / image . the ##lance ##t . com / extras / 03 ##art ##43 ##47 ##we ##b . pdf 
abstract introduction : the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) warrant ##s the search for effective anti ##vira ##l agents to treat the disease . this study describes the assessment of the anti ##vira ##l potential of ni ##tric oxide ( no ) against sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strain frankfurt - 1 replica ##ting in african green monkey ( ve ##ro e ##6 ) cells . results : two organic no donor compounds , s - ni ##tro ##so - n - ace ##ty ##lp ##eni ##ci ##lla ##mine ( snap ) and sodium ni ##tro ##pr ##uss ##ide ( s ##np ) , were tested in a broad range of concentrations . the non - ni ##tro ##sy ##lated form of snap , n - ace ##ty ##lp ##eni ##ci ##lla ##mine ( nap ) , was included as a control compound in the ass ##ay . anti ##vira ##l activity was estimated by the inhibition of the sar ##s - co ##v cy ##top ##athic effect in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , determined by a te ##tra ##zo ##lium - based color ##ime ##tric method . cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city of the compounds was tested in parallel . conclusion : the survival rate of sar ##s - co ##v infected cells was greatly increased by the treatment with snap , and the concentration of this compound needed to inhibit the viral cy ##top ##athic effect to 50 % was 222 ##μ ##m , with a select ##ivity index of 3 . no anti - sar ##s - co ##v effect could be detected for s ##np and nap .  
summary the recent emergence of the novel , pathogen ##ic sar ##s - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in china and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency . cell entry of corona ##virus ##es depends on binding of the viral spike ( s ) proteins to cellular receptors and on s protein pri ##ming by host cell pro ##tea ##ses . un ##rave ##lling which cellular factors are used by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets . here , we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 uses the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ace ##2 for entry and the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 for s protein pri ##ming . a t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option . finally , we show that the sera from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients cross - neutral ##ized sar ##s - 2 - s - driven entry . our results reveal important common ##ali ##ties between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v infection and identify a potential target for anti ##vira ##l intervention .  
abstract nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein plays a critical role in sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , and high - level anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antibodies are detected in the patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . several studies have shown that there exists an interaction between nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and membrane ( m ) protein . in this paper , we investigate whether the expression of membrane protein can affect the immune responses induced by nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id dna im ##mun ##ization . two rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##ds containing m and n coding sequence were constructed . moreover , in order to get the antigen for elisa and in vitro stimulation ass ##ay , n protein were expressed and pu ##rified from e . coli bacteria . injection of 20 ##μ ##g of the mixture of pv ##ax ##1 - m and pv ##ax ##1 - n into the bal ##b / c mice could eli ##cit the humor ##al and cellular responses . the elisa analysis using the n antigen or inactivated sar ##s - co ##v particles as capture antigen showed that co - injection of sar ##s - m could enhance n - induced antibody production , especially i ##gg ##2 ##a sub ##class . after l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes were stimulated with 10 ##μ ##g / ml pu ##rified n antigen , the cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells of n and m plus n group were increased compared with those of control groups , and the m protein could aug ##ment the activation of l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes induced by n dna vaccine . cy ##tok ##ine elisa analysis revealed that co - injection of m could enhance the levels of if ##n - γ , il - 2 release induced by n antigen . further experiments in field mouse also support the claim that membrane protein can aug ##ment the n - specific immune responses . virus challenge test was conducted in bs ##l ##3 bio safety laboratory with brandt ' s vol ##e sar ##s - co ##v model , and the results indicated that co - im ##mun ##ization of m and n antigen ##s could reduce the mortality and path ##ological changes in lung from the virus infection .  
• detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 within 3 . 5 h ( sample - to - answer - time ) by random access real time pc ##r . • adapt ##ion of an already published real time pc ##r for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to a fully automatic , random access pc ##r system . • detection of all sar ##s - co ##v ( from 2002 , which may be soon labelled as sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) with a pc ##r for the highly conserved e gene region . • differentiation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with a pc ##r for the rd ##rp gene .  
summary background although the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been sequence ##d and a possible animal reservoir identified , ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce studies and mass screening for detection of sub ##cl ##ini ##cal and non - p ##ne ##um ##onic infections are still lacking . methods we clone ##d and pu ##rified the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein and spike poly ##pe ##pt ##ide of sar ##s - co ##v and examined their im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity with serum from patients with sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia . an elisa based on rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein for i ##gg detection was tested with serum from 149 healthy blood donors who donated 3 years previously and with serum positive for antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v ( by indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ) from 106 patients with sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of sar ##s - co ##v was studied with the elisa in healthy blood donors who donated during the sar ##s outbreak in hong kong , non - p ##ne ##um ##onic hospital in ##patient ##s , and sy ##mpt ##om - free health - care workers . all positive samples were confirmed by two separate western - b ##lot ass ##ays ( with rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein and rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike poly ##pe ##pt ##ide ) . findings western - b ##lot analysis showed that the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein and spike poly ##pe ##pt ##ide of sar ##s - co ##v are highly im ##mun ##ogenic . the specific ##ity of the i ##gg antibody test ( elisa with positive samples confirmed by the two western - b ##lot ass ##ays ) was 100 % , and the sensitivity was 94 · 3 % . three of 400 healthy blood donors who donated during the sar ##s outbreak and one of 131 non - p ##ne ##um ##onic pa ##ed ##ia ##tric in ##patient ##s were positive for i ##gg antibodies , confirmed by the two western - b ##lot ass ##ays ( total , 0 · 48 % of our study population ) . interpretation our findings support the existence of sub ##cl ##ini ##cal or non - p ##ne ##um ##onic sar ##s - co ##v infections . such infections are more common than sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia in our locality .  
most new emerging viruses are derived from strains circulating in zoo ##not ##ic reservoirs . corona ##virus ##es , which had an established potential for cross - species transmission within domestic ##ated animals , suddenly became relevant with the unexpected emergence of the highly pathogen ##ic human sar ##s - co ##v strain from zoo ##not ##ic reservoirs in 2002 . sar ##s - co ##v infected approximately 800 ##0 people worldwide before public health measures halted the epidemic . supported by robust time - ordered sequence variation , structural biology , well - characterized patient pools , and biological data , the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v represents one of the best - studied natural models of viral disease emergence from zoo ##not ##ic sources . this review article sum ##mar ##izes previous and more recent advances into the molecular and structural characteristics , with particular emphasis on host – receptor interactions , that drove this remarkable virus disease outbreak in human populations .  
abstract the activity of in ##osi ##ne - 5 ′ - mono ##ph ##os ##phate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ( imp ##dh ) inhibitors , mi ##zo ##ri ##bine and rib ##avi ##rin , against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was determined by plaque reduction and yield reduction ass ##ays . mi ##zo ##ri ##bine and rib ##avi ##rin selective ##ly inhibit ##ed replication of sar ##s - co ##v . the 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration ( ic ##50 ) of mi ##zo ##ri ##bine for sar ##s - co ##v frankfurt - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v hk ##u ##39 ##8 ##49 , as determined by plaque reduction was 3 . 5 ##μ ##g / ml and 16 ##μ ##g / ml , respectively , and the ic ##50 of rib ##avi ##rin for sar ##s - co ##v frankfurt - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v hk ##u ##39 ##8 ##49 was 20 ##μ ##g / ml and 80 ##μ ##g / ml , while the 50 % cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c concentration of mi ##zo ##ri ##bine and rib ##avi ##rin for ve ##ro e ##6 cells exceeded 200 ##μ ##g / ml . in a yield reduction ass ##ay , mi ##zo ##ri ##bine ( 10 ##μ ##g / ml ) and rib ##avi ##rin ( 40 ##μ ##g / ml ) inhibit ##ed the replication of sar ##s - co ##v and reduced the infectious sar ##s - co ##v ti ##ters to one - tenth or less . mi ##zo ##ri ##bine inhibit ##ed replication of sar ##s - co ##v more strongly than rib ##avi ##rin . however , neither drug could completely inhibit replication of sar ##s - co ##v even at concentrations up to 100 ##μ ##g / ml .  
summary sar ##s corona ##virus continues to cause sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in china . no active or passive im ##mun ##op ##rop ##hyl ##ax ##is for disease induced by sar ##s corona ##virus is available . we investigated prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of sar ##s corona ##virus infection with a neutral ##ising human mono ##cl ##onal antibody in fe ##rret ##s , which can be readily infected with the virus . prop ##hyl ##actic administration of the mono ##cl ##onal antibody at 10 mg / kg reduced replication of sar ##s corona ##virus in the lungs of infected fe ##rret ##s by 3 · 3 logs ( 95 % cl 2 · 6 – 4 · 0 logs ; p < 0 · 001 ) , completely prevented the development of sar ##s corona ##virus - induced macro ##scopic lung pathology ( p = 0 · 01 ##3 ) , and abolished shed ##ding of virus in ph ##ary ##nge ##al secret ##ions . the data generated in this animal model show that administration of a human mono ##cl ##onal antibody might offer a feasible and effective prop ##hyl ##ax ##is for the control of human sar ##s corona ##virus infection .  
the corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a highly transmit ##table and pathogen ##ic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which emerged in wu ##han , china and spread around the world . gen ##omic analysis revealed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is phylogenetic ##ally related to severe acute respiratory syndrome - like ( sar ##s - like ) bat viruses , therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir . the intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known , however , the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely . there is no clinical ##ly approved anti ##vira ##l drug or vaccine available to be used against co ##vid - 19 . however , few broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs have been evaluated against co ##vid - 19 in clinical trials , resulted in clinical recovery . in the current review , we sum ##mar ##ize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogen ##ici ##ty of co ##vid - 19 infection and previous human corona ##virus ##es severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . we also discuss the approaches for developing effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak .  
abstract an acute and often severe respiratory illness emerged in southern china in late 2002 and rapidly spread to different areas of the far east as well as several countries around the globe . when the outbreak of this apparently novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) came to an end in july 2003 , it had caused over 800 ##0 probable cases worldwide and more than 700 deaths . starting in march 2003 , the world health organization ( who ) organised an unprecedented international effort by leading laboratories working together to find the ca ##usa ##tive agent . little more than one week later , three research groups from this who - coordinated network simultaneously found evidence of a hit ##her ##to unknown corona ##virus in sar ##s patients , using different approaches . after koch ’ s post ##ulates had been fulfilled , who officially declared on 16 april 2003 that this virus never before seen in humans is the cause of sar ##s . ever since , progress around sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been swift . within weeks of the first isolate being obtained , its complete genome was sequence ##d . diagnostic tests based on the detection of sar ##s - co ##v rna were developed and made available freely and widely ; nevertheless the sar ##s case definition still remains based on clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological criteria . the agent ’ s environmental stability , methods suitable for ina ##ct ##ivation and di ##sin ##fect ##ion , and potential anti ##vira ##l compounds have been studied , and development of vaccines and im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##cs is ongoing . despite its grave consequences in humanitarian , political and economic terms , sar ##s may serve as an example of how much can be achieved through a well - coordinated international approach , combining the latest technological advances of molecular vi ##rol ##ogy with more “ traditional ” techniques carried out to an excellent standard .  
abstract hem ##ato ##logical changes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) are common and frequently include th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia . using a elisa method , we found an increase in th ##rom ##bo ##po ##ie ##tin ( t ##po ) levels in the plasma of con ##vale ##sc ##ed sar ##s patients ( 290 ##± ##53 pg / ml ) and active sar ##s patients ( 251 ##± ##23 pg / ml ) comparing to that from normal control patients ( 228 ##± ##17 pg / ml ) . in addition , the plasma from active sar ##s patients had an inhibitor ##y effect on cf ##u - mk formation , which could be neutral ##ized by anti - t ##gf - β antibodies . in the experiment to determine whether sar ##s - co ##v can directly in ##fect hem ##ato ##po ##ie ##tic stem cells and mega ##kar ##yo ##cy ##tic cells , inc ##uba ##tion of the cells with sar ##s - co ##v did not show active infection . our findings of increased t ##po levels in the plasma of sar ##s patients provide a possible explanation for the genesis of th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##tosis , which frequently develops from th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia in sar ##s patients .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) envelope ( e ) protein is a trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein . several sub ##cellular locations and topological conform ##ations of e protein have been proposed . to identify the correct ones , poly ##cl ##onal and mono ##cl ##onal antibodies specific for the amino or the car ##box ##y terminus of e protein , respectively , were generated . e protein was mainly found in the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum - go ##l ##gi intermediate compartment ( er ##gic ) of cells trans ##fect ##ed with a pl ##as ##mi ##d encoding e protein or infected with sar ##s - co ##v . no evidence of e protein presence in the plasma membrane was found by using im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , im ##mun ##oe ##le ##ct ##ron microscopy and cell surface protein labeling . in addition , measurement of plasma membrane voltage gate ##d ion channel activity by whole - cell patch cl ##amp suggested that e protein was not present in the plasma membrane . a topological conform ##ation in which sar ##s - co ##v e protein amino terminus is oriented towards the lu ##men of intra ##cellular membranes and car ##box ##y terminus faces cell cy ##top ##las ##m is proposed .  
abstract a new disease , the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , emerged at the beginning of 2003 and rapidly spread throughout the world . although the disease had disappeared in june 2003 its re - emergence cannot be excluded . the development of vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v may take years . therefore , the availability of effective anti ##vira ##l drugs against sar ##s - co ##v may be crucial for the control of future sar ##s outbreak ##s . in this review , experimental and clinical data about potential anti - sar ##s drugs is sum ##mar ##ised and discussed . animal model studies will be needed to help to determine which interventions warrant controlled clinical testing .  
abstract lip ##id raft ##s often serve as an entry site for certain viruses . here , we report that lip ##id raft ##s in ve ##ro e ##6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ay showed the integrity of lip ##id raft ##s was required for productive infection of pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s - co ##v . de ##ple ##tion of plasma membrane cho ##les ##terol with m ##β ##cd re ##lo ##cal ##ized raft - resident marker cave ##olin - 1 as well as sar ##s - co ##v receptor ace ##2 to a non ##raf ##t environment , but did not significantly change the surface expression of ace ##2 . m ##β ##cd - treatment inhibit ##ed in ##fect ##ivity of pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s - co ##v by 90 % . bio ##chemical fraction ##ation and con ##fo ##cal imaging confirmed that ace ##2 col ##oca ##lized with raft - resident markers . furthermore , an ec ##to ##dom ##ain of sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( s ##11 ##8 ##8 ##ha ) could associate with lip ##id raft ##s after binding to its receptor , and col ##oca ##li ##ze with raft - resident marker gang ##lio ##side gm ##1 . the binding of s ##11 ##8 ##8 ##ha was not affected by de ##ple ##ting plasma membrane cho ##les ##terol . taken together , our results support that lip ##id raft ##s serve as an entry port for sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is responsible for host cell attachment and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes . within s the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) media ##tes the interaction with ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the sar ##s - co ##v host cell receptor . both s and the rb ##d are highly im ##mun ##ogenic and both have been found to eli ##cit neutral ##izing antibodies . reported here is the x - ray crystal structure of the rb ##d in complex with the fa ##b of a neutral ##izing mouse mono ##cl ##onal antibody , f ##26 ##g ##19 , eli ##cite ##d by im ##mun ##ization with chemical ##ly inactivated sar ##s - co ##v . the rb ##d – f ##26 ##g ##19 fa ##b complex represents the first example of the structural characterization of an antibody eli ##cite ##d by an immune response to sar ##s - co ##v or any fragment of it . the structure reveals that the rb ##d surface recognized by f ##26 ##g ##19 overlap ##s significantly with the surface recognized by ace ##2 and , as such , suggests that f ##26 ##g ##19 likely neutral ##izes sar ##s - co ##v by blocking the virus – host cell interaction .  
with the current trajectory of the 2019 ‐ nc ##ov outbreak unknown , public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to opt ##imi ##ze patient outcomes . although little is known about the virus , an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homo ##logy with its better ‐ studied cousin , sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the spike protein used for host cell infection shows key non ##sy ##non ##ym ##ous mutations that might ham ##per the efficacy of previously developed therapeutic ##s but remains a viable target for the development of bio ##logic ##s and macro ##cy ##cl ##ic peptide ##s . other key drug targets , including rna ‐ dependent rna polymer ##ase and corona ##virus main protein ##ase ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) , share a striking ##ly high ( > 95 % ) homo ##logy to sar ##s ‐ co ##v . here ##in , we suggest four potential drug candidates ( an ace ##2 ‐ based peptide , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , 3 ##cl ##pro ‐ 1 and a novel vinyl ##sul ##fo ##ne pro ##tea ##se inhibitor ) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019 ‐ nc ##ov . we also sum ##mar ##ize previous efforts into drug ##ging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad ‐ spectrum anti ‐ corona ##vira ##l agents for future epidemic ##s .  
abstract caused by a new corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious disease associated with significant fatal ##ity that emerged in 2003 . the molecular cause of the unusually high human pathogen ##ici ##ty of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is still unknown . in an effort to character ##ize molecular components of the virus that are absent in other corona ##virus ##es , all of which are considerably less pathogen ##ic for humans , we rec ##om ##bina ##ntly produced the sar ##s - unique domain ( sud ) within non - structural protein 3 ( ns ##p ##3 ) of sar ##s - co ##v and characterized its nuclei ##c - acid binding properties . zone - interference gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is and electro ##ph ##ore ##tic mobility shift ass ##ays revealed a specific affinity of sud for ol ##igo ( g ) - strings . a few such segments are present in the sar ##s - co ##v genome , but also in mrna ##s of host proteins involved in the regulation of signaling pathways . a put ##ative role of sud in virus - induced ap ##op ##tosis or survival of host cells is discussed .  
• middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is res ##urgent in saudi arabia . • intercontinental travel facilitates the spread of mer ##s - co ##v infection to other global locations . • improved vi ##gil ##ance is imperative to curb the dissemination of infection . • discovery of an effective therapy and prop ##hyl ##ax ##is is a public health priority .  
abstract a novel corona ##virus has been associated with a worldwide outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein has been clone ##d sequence ##d and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli strain . pu ##rified n protein was used to measure the sar ##s - co ##v specific i ##gg antibodies from 16 sar ##s - co ##v infected patients ’ sera and from 131 control subjects using elisa ass ##ay . specific antibody responses to the pu ##rified rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein after 10 , 20 , and 30 days of disease onset were observed in 13 of 16 ( 81 . 3 % ) , 16 of 16 ( 100 % ) and 16 of 16 ( 100 % ) sar ##s patients sera , respectively . comparison of detection results with a commercially available diagnostic kit coated with a mixture of sar ##s - co ##v viral proteins showed 9 of 16 ( 56 . 3 % ) , 13 of 16 ( 81 . 3 % ) , and 15 of 16 ( 93 . 7 % ) positive responses , respectively . none of 131 control sera gave positive reaction in either ass ##ay . this data suggests that the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v is im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant and this elisa based test ass ##ay for detecting the sar ##s - co ##v n antigen may hold a significant value for sar ##s diagnosis .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) closely resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in disease manifestation as rapidly progressive acute pneumonia with multi - organ dysfunction . using mono ##cy ##te - derived - den ##dr ##itic cells ( mo - dc ##s ) , we discovered fundamental disc ##re ##pan ##cies in the outcome of mer ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ and sar ##s - co ##v - infection . first , mer ##s - co ##v productive ##ly infected mo - dc ##s while sar ##s - co ##v - infection was ab ##ort ##ive . second , mer ##s - co ##v induced significantly higher levels of if ##n - γ , ip - 10 , il - 12 , and ran ##tes expression than sar ##s - co ##v . third , mer ##s - co ##v - infection induced higher surface expression of m ##hc class ii ( h ##la - dr ) and the co - st ##im ##ulator ##y molecule cd ##86 than sar ##s - co ##v - infection . overall , our data suggests that the den ##dr ##itic cell can serve as an important target of viral replication and a vehicle for dissemination . mer ##s - co ##v - infection in dc ##s results in the production of a rich combination of cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es , and mod ##ulates innate immune response differently from that of sar ##s - co ##v - infection . our findings may help to explain the apparent disc ##re ##pan ##cy in the pathogen ##ici ##ty between mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v is a newly identified corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . currently , there is no effective method available for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infections . in the present study , the influence of small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) on sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein expression was detected in culture ##d cells and mouse muscles . four sir ##na expression cassette ##s driven by mouse u ##6 promoter targeting sar ##s - co ##v n gene were prepared , and their inhibitor ##y effects on expression of n and enhanced green flu ##orescence protein ( e ##gf ##p ) fusion protein were observed . a candidate sir ##na was proved to down - regulate n and e ##gf ##p expression actively in a sequence - specific manner . the expression vector of this sir ##na was constructed and confirmed to reduce n and e ##gf ##p expression efficiently in both culture ##d cells and adult mouse muscles . our findings suggest that the sir ##na should provide the basis for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and therapy of sar ##s - co ##v infection in human .

abstract inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) are a first line of defense against viral infection . here ##in we describe the use of an aden ##ov ##irus vector ##ed mouse if ##n alpha gene ( md ##ef ##20 ##1 ) as a prop ##hyl ##actic and treatment counter ##me ##as ##ure in a sar ##s - co ##v - infected bal ##b / c mouse model . complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of md ##ef ##20 ##1 administered intra ##nas ##ally 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 14 days prior to lethal sar ##s - co ##v challenge ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge . in addition , low doses of md ##ef ##20 ##1 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology . intra ##nas ##al treatment with md ##ef ##20 ##1 ranging from 106 to 108 p ##fu significantly protected mice against a lethal sar ##s - co ##v infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12 ##h post infection ( p < 0 . 001 ) . the data suggest that md ##ef ##20 ##1 is a new class of anti ##vira ##l agent further development as treatment for sar ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract the existence of corona ##virus ##es in bats is unknown until the recent discovery of bat - sar ##s - co ##v in chinese horseshoe bats and a novel group 1 corona ##virus in other bat species . among 309 bats of 13 species captured from 20 different locations in rural areas of hong kong over a 16 - month period , corona ##virus ##es were amplified from anal sw ##ab ##s of 37 ( 12 % ) bats by rt - pc ##r . phylogenetic analysis of rna - dependent - rna - polymer ##ase ( pol ) and he ##lica ##se genes revealed six novel corona ##virus ##es from six different bat species , in addition to the two previously described corona ##virus ##es . among the six novel corona ##virus ##es , four were group 1 corona ##virus ##es ( bat - co ##v hk ##u ##2 from chinese horseshoe bat , bat - co ##v hk ##u ##6 from rick ##ett ' s big - footed bat , bat - co ##v hk ##u ##7 from greater bent - winged bat and bat - co ##v hk ##u ##8 from lesser bent - winged bat ) and two were group 2 corona ##virus ##es ( bat - co ##v hk ##u ##4 from lesser bamboo bats and bat - co ##v hk ##u ##5 from japanese pip ##ist ##rell ##es ) . an astonishing diversity of corona ##virus ##es was observed in bats .  
abstract rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) variants lacking the group specific genes 6 , 7 ##a , 7 ##b , 8 ##a , 8 ##b and 9 ##b ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ [ 6 – 9 ##b ] ) , the structural gene e ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e ) , and a combination of both sets of genes ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ [ e , 6 – 9 ##b ] ) have been generated . all these viruses were rescued in monkey ( ve ##ro e ##6 ) cells and were also infectious for human ( huh - 7 , huh ##7 . 5 . 1 and ca ##co - 2 ) cell lines and for trans ##genic ( t ##g ) mice expressing the sar ##s - co ##v receptor human ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme - 2 ( ha ##ce - 2 ) , indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle . furthermore , in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the w ##t virus , indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the vi ##rion ##s . nevertheless , in the absence of e protein , release of virus particles efficacy was reduced . viruses lacking e protein grew about 100 - fold lower than the w ##t virus in lungs of t ##g infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals , in contrast to the rs ##ars - co ##v - δ [ 6 – 9 ##b ] virus , which grew almost as well as the w ##t in both tissues . viruses lacking e protein were highly at ##ten ##uated in the highly sensitive ha ##ce - 2 t ##g mice , in contrast to the minimal rs ##ars - co ##v - δ [ 6 – 9 ##b ] and w ##t viruses . these data indicate that e gene might be a vi ##ru ##lence factor influencing replication level , tissue tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v , suggesting that δ ##e at ##ten ##uated viruses are promising vaccine candidates .  
an acute respiratory disease , caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , previously known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) , the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) has spread throughout china and received worldwide attention . on 30 january 2020 , world health organization ( who ) officially declared the co ##vid - 19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern . the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , since the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , marked the third introduction of a highly pathogen ##ic and large - scale epidemic corona ##virus into the human population in the twenty - first century . as of 1 march 2020 , a total of 87 , 137 confirmed cases globally , 79 , 96 ##8 confirmed in china and 71 ##6 ##9 outside of china , with 297 ##7 deaths ( 3 . 4 % ) had been reported by who . meanwhile , several independent research groups have identified that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 belongs to β - corona ##virus , with highly identical genome to bat corona ##virus , pointing to bat as the natural host . the novel corona ##virus uses the same receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as that for sar ##s - co ##v , and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract . importantly , increasingly evidence showed sustained human - to - human transmission , along with many exported cases across the globe . the clinical symptoms of co ##vid - 19 patients include fever , cough , fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gas ##tro ##int ##estinal infection symptoms . the elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes , which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and cy ##tok ##ine storm . currently , there are few specific anti ##vira ##l strategies , but several potent candidates of anti ##vira ##ls and rep ##ur ##posed drugs are under urgent investigation . in this review , we summarized the latest research progress of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , pathogen ##esis , and clinical characteristics of co ##vid - 19 , and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancement ##s to combat the epidemic novel corona ##virus .  
abstract a series of tri ##fl ##uo ##rom ##eth ##yl , benz ##oth ##ia ##zo ##ly ##l or th ##ia ##zo ##ly ##l ke ##tone - containing pep ##ti ##dic compounds as sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se inhibitors were developed and their pot ##ency was evaluated by in vitro pro ##tea ##se inhibitor ##y ass ##ays . three candidates had encouraging results for the development of new anti - sar ##s compounds .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes an infectious disease through respiratory route . dia ##gno ##sing the disease effectively and accurately at early stage is essential for preventing the disease transmission and performing anti ##vira ##l treatment . in this study , we raised mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v and mapped ep ##ito ##pes by using different truncated n protein fragments . the mapping of those ep ##ito ##pes was valuable for constructing pair - abs used in ser ##ological diagnosis . the results showed that all of the six raised mab ##s were divided into two groups recognizing the region of amino acids 249 – 317 ( a group ) or 317 – 395 ( b group ) . this region spanning amino acids 249 – 395 contains predominant b cell ep ##ito ##pes located at the c - terminus of n protein . one pair - abs , consisting of n protein - specific rabbit poly ##cl ##onal antibody and sar ##s - co ##v n protein - specific mab , was selected to construct a sandwich elisa - kit . the kit was able to specifically detect sar ##s - co ##v n proteins in serum samples .  
the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n protein ) has been found to be an antigen ##ic protein in a number of corona ##virus ##es . whether the n protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is antigen ##ic remains to be el ##uc ##ida ##ted . using western b ##lot and enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt n proteins and the synthesized peptide ##s derived from the n protein were screened in sera from sar ##s patients . all patient sera in this study displayed strong positive im ##mun ##ore ##act ##iv ##ities against the rec ##om ##bina ##nt n proteins , whereas normal sera gave negative im ##mun ##ores ##pon ##ses to these proteins , indicating that the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v is an antigen ##ic protein . furthermore , the ep ##ito ##pe sites in the n protein were determined by competition experiments , in which the rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins or the synthesized peptide ##s competed against the sar ##s - co ##v proteins to bind to the antibodies raised in sar ##s sera . one ep ##ito ##pe site located at the c - terminus was confirmed as the most antigen ##ic region in this protein . a detailed screening of peptide with elisa demonstrated that the amino sequence from cod ##ons 37 ##1 to 407 was the ep ##ito ##pe site at the c - terminus of the n protein . understanding of the ep ##ito ##pe sites could be very significant for developing an effective diagnostic approach to sar ##s .  
abstract a dangerous cy ##tok ##ine storm occurs in the sar ##s involving in immune disorder , but many aspects of the pathogen ##etic mechanism remain obscure since its outbreak . to deeply reveal the interaction of host and sar ##s - co ##v , based on the basic structural feature of pathogen - associated molecular pattern , we created a new bio ##in ##form ##atics method for searching potential pathogen ##ic molecules and identified a set of sar ##s - co ##v specific gu - rich ssr ##na fragments with a high - density distribution in the genome . in vitro experiments , the result showed the representative sar ##s - co ##v ssr ##nas had powerful im ##mun ##ost ##im ##ulator ##y activities to induce considerable level of pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine tn ##f - a , il - 6 and il - 12 release via the t ##lr ##7 and t ##lr ##8 , almost 2 - fold higher than the strong st ##im ##ulator ##y ssr ##na ##40 that was found previously from other virus . moreover , sar ##s - co ##v ssr ##na was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate in vivo experiment . it suggests that sar ##s - co ##v specific gu - rich ssr ##na plays a very important role in the cy ##tok ##ine storm associated with a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of the innate immunity . this study not only presents new evidence about the im ##mun ##opa ##th ##olo ##gic damage caused by over ##active inflammation during the sar ##s - co ##v infection , but also provides a useful clue for a new therapeutic strategy .  
abstract development of va ##cci ##nation strategies for emerging pathogen ##s are particularly challenging because of the sudden nature of their emergence and the long process needed for traditional vaccine development . therefore , there is a need for development of a rapid method of vaccine development that can respond to emerging pathogen ##s in a short time frame . the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in late 2012 demonstrate the importance of corona ##virus ##es as emerging pathogen ##s . the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of corona ##virus ##es reside on the surface of the vi ##rion and are responsible for virus entry . the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is the major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant antigen of corona ##virus ##es and has proven to be an excellent target for vaccine designs that seek to block corona ##virus entry and promote antibody targeting of infected cells . va ##cci ##nation strategies for corona ##virus ##es have involved live at ##ten ##uated virus , rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses , non - replica ##tive virus - like particles expressing corona ##virus proteins or dna pl ##as ##mi ##ds expressing corona ##virus genes . none of these strategies has progressed to an approved human corona ##virus vaccine in the ten years since sar ##s - co ##v emerged . here we describe a novel method for generating mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v full - length spike nano ##par ##tic ##les , which in combination with ad ##ju ##vant ##s are able to produce high ti ##ter antibodies in mice .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was initially isolated from a patient who was admitted to a private hospital in the western part of the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2012 . subsequently , mer ##s - co ##v resulted in many sporadic cases , multiple intra ##fa ##mi ##lia ##l transmission , and major outbreak ##s in healthcare settings . of all the cases reported within the kingdom of saudi arabia , 38 % of the cases were primary , 45 % were healthcare - associated infection , and 14 % were household infections . the clinical spectrum of the mer ##s - co ##v infection ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections , mild or moderately sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases , and severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions and may result in death . within healthcare settings , transmissions of mer ##s - co ##v are facilitated by over ##crow ##ding , poor infection control measures , un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed infections , and super ##sp ##rea ##der phenomenon . currently , there is no approved therapy for mer ##s - co ##v and there are no vaccines .  
abstract the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has led to a renewed interest in studying the role of accessory proteins in regulating corona ##virus infections in the natural host . a significant body of evidence has accumulated in the area of sar ##s - co ##v and host interactions that indicate that the accessory proteins might play an important role in mod ##ulating the host response to virus infection and thereby , contribute to pathogen ##esis . in this review , we have compiled the current knowledge about sar ##s - co ##v accessory proteins , obtained from studies in cell culture systems , reverse genetics and animal models , to shed some light into the possible role of these proteins in the propagation and vi ##ru ##lence of sar ##s - co ##v in its natural host . we conclude by providing some questions for future studies that will greatly advance our knowledge about the biological significance and contributions of the accessory proteins in the development of sar ##s in humans .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the first global epidemic in the 21st century , affected over 850 ##0 people in approximately 30 countries ( 1 – 7 ) . with a crude mortality of 9 % , its cause was quickly identified as a novel corona ##virus that jumped species from animals to man . the sar ##s corona ##virus epidemic , which began in the fall of 2002 , was related to the exotic food industry in southern china , initially involving di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate numbers of animal handler ##s , chefs , and cater ##ers . subsequently , person - to - person transmission spawned the outbreak . what distinguished this illness clinical ##ly was the fact that approximately half of the victims were health care workers ( 8 ) , infected while caring for recognized or un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed patients with sar ##s . there are many cu ##rio ##sities and uncertain ##ties surrounding the epidemic of sar ##s with lessons that may be useful to the community of infectious diseases physicians , especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic . here ##in we relate our perspectives on useful lessons derived from a review of the sar ##s epidemic .  
cross - species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a marked threat to human and animal health ( 1 ) . bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a corona ##virus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high - impact emerging zoo ##nosis , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ( 2 – 10 ) . here we provide vi ##rol ##ogical , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel hk ##u ##2 - related bat corona ##virus , sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hoe ##a syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) , is the ae ##ti ##ological agent that was responsible for a large - scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in china that has caused the death of 24 , 69 ##3 pig ##lets across four farms . notably , the outbreak began in guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic . furthermore , we identified sad ##s - related co ##vs with 96 – 98 % sequence identity in 9 . 8 % ( 58 out of 59 ##1 ) of anal sw ##ab ##s collected from bats in guangdong province during 2013 – 2016 , predominantly in horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus spp . ) that are known reservoirs of sar ##s - related co ##vs . we found that there were striking similarities between the sad ##s and sar ##s outbreak ##s in geographical , temporal , ecological and ae ##ti ##ological settings . this study highlights the importance of identifying corona ##virus diversity and distribution in bats to mit ##igate future outbreak ##s that could threaten livestock , public health and economic growth .  
abstract background : the protocols of who network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) using reverse transcription ( rt ) - pc ##r ass ##ays . however , several reports have shown that conventional and real - time pc ##r ass ##ays were very specific for sar ##s co ##v but lack sensitivity depending on the ass ##ay , specimen , and time course of disease . objective : to evaluate an automatic nuclei ##c acid extraction system and two standardized real - time pc ##r ass ##ays for rapid diagnosis of sar ##s co ##v during outbreak and post - epidemic periods in hong kong . study design : specimens from clinical ##ly suspected sar ##s patients collected during outbreak and post - epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nuclei ##c acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional rt - pc ##r and two standardized real - time pc ##r ass ##ays ( art ##us gmbh , germany and roche diagnostic ##s , germany ) . paired serum samples were ass ##ay ##ed for increasing ti ##ter against sar ##s co ##v . results : in the sar ##s epidemic , art ##us and roche pc ##r ass ##ays exhibited sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 87 % and 85 % for respiratory specimens ( n = 64 ) , 91 % and 88 % for stool ( n = 44 ) , and 82 % for urine ( n = 29 ) . a specific ##ity of 100 % was exhibited by both pc ##r ass ##ays except art ##us attained only a 92 % specific ##ity for stool . for post - epidemic period , no sar ##s co ##v was identified among 56 respiratory specimens by all pc ##r ass ##ays . inhibitors to pc ##r ass ##ays were detected at an average rate of 7 – 8 % among 202 clinical specimens . conclusion : this study highlights the high through ##put and performance of automatic rna extraction in coordination with standardized real - time pc ##r ass ##ays suitable for large - scale routine diagnosis in case of future sar ##s epidemic . as no sar ##s co ##v was detected among specimens collected during post - epidemic period , the positive predict ##ive value of real - time pc ##r ass ##ays for detection of sar ##s co ##v during low epidemic requires further evaluation .  
abstract an effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) will probably require the generation and maintenance of both humor ##al and cellular immune responses . it has been reported that after natural infection in humans and im ##mun ##ization in animals with sar ##s - co ##v vaccine , antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time . in the present study , mice were im ##mun ##ized i . m . with sar ##s - co ##v s dna vaccine , and three different methods ( elisa , eli ##sp ##ot and fa ##cs ) were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptide ##s overlapping entire sar ##s spike protein . the results show that prime - im ##mun ##ization with sar ##s - co ##v s dna vaccine can induce both cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cell responses . boost ##ing with the same vaccine enhance ##s cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cell responses in both l ##ym ##ph ##oid and non ##ly ##mp ##ho ##id organs and were persistent over two months . the sar ##s - co ##v s - specific cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells were cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− , a marker for memory cells , and − ##30 to 50 % of the cells expressed il - 7 ##r ##α ( cd ##12 ##7 ) , a marker for the capacity of effect ##or cells to develop into memory cells . in addition , im ##mun ##ization with the dna vaccine eli ##cite ##d high levels of antibody production . taken together , these data demonstrate that im ##mun ##ization with sar ##s - co ##v s dna vaccine can generate antigen - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses that may contribute to long - term protection .  
summary the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , which affected over 800 ##0 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002 – 2003 outbreak , is a corona ##virus that was unknown before the outbreak . although many different treatments were used during the outbreak , none were implemented in a controlled fashion . thus , the optimal treatment for sar ##s is unknown . since the outbreak , much work has been done testing new agents against sar ##s using in - vitro methods and animal models . in addition , global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against sar ##s . efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials , should another sar ##s outbreak occur .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is responsible for sar ##s infection . nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v en ##cap ##si ##dates the viral rna and plays an important role in virus particle assembly and release . in this study , the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v was found to associate with b ##23 , a ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein in nu ##cle ##ol ##us , in vitro and in vivo . mapping studies localized the critical n sequences for this interaction to amino acid residues 175 – 210 , which included a ser ##ine / ar ##gin ##ine ( sr ) - rich domain . in vitro ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation ass ##ay showed that the n protein inhibit ##ed the b ##23 ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation at th ##r ##19 ##9 .  
abstract the severity and global spread of the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) highlighted the risks to human health posed by emerging viral diseases and emphasized the need for specific therapeutic agents instead of relying on existing broadly active anti ##vira ##l compounds . the development of rapid screening ass ##ays is essential for anti ##vira ##l drug discovery . thus , a screening system for anti - sar ##s - co ##v agents was developed , which evaluated compound pot ##ency , specific ##ity and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city at the initial screening phase . cell lines were engineered to con ##sti ##tu ##tively express an enhanced green fluorescent protein ( e ##gf ##p ) and used to detect ( 1 ) anti ##vira ##l pot ##ency in sar ##s - co ##v infection tests ; ( 2 ) anti ##vira ##l specific ##ity in tests using the por ##cine corona ##virus trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus ( t ##ge ##v ) ; and ( 3 ) cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city in the same ass ##ays without virus challenge . the ass ##ay system involves minimal manipulation after ass ##ay set - up , facilitates automated read - out and minimize ##s risks associated with hazardous viruses . the suit ##ability of this ass ##ay system in drug discovery was demonstrated by screening of 338 ##8 small molecule compounds . the results show that these ass ##ays can be applied to high - through ##put screening for identification of inhibitors selective ##ly active against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , an emerging disease characterized by at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , has recently been attributed to a novel corona ##virus . the genome of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has recently been sequence ##d , and a number of genes identified , including that of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) . it is noted , however , that the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v n ) shares little homo ##logy with nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins of other members of the corona ##virus family [ science 300 ( 2003 ) 139 ##9 ; science 300 ( 2003 ) 139 ##4 ] . n proteins of other corona ##virus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral rna . as data generated from some viral systems other than corona ##virus ##es suggested that viral n – n self - interactions may be necessary for subsequent formation of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and assembly of the viral particles , we decided to investigate sar ##s - co ##v n – n interaction . by using mammalian two - hybrid system and su ##cr ##ose gradient fraction ##ations , a homo ##typic interaction of n , but not m , was detected by the two - hybrid analysis . the mammalian two - hybrid ass ##ay revealed an approximately 50 - fold increase in sea ##p activity ( measurement of protein – protein interaction ) in n – n interaction compared to that observed in either m – m or mock trans ##fect ##ion . furthermore , mutation ##al analyses characterized that a ser ##ine / ar ##gin ##ine - rich motif ( ssr ##ss ##sr ##sr ##gn ##sr ) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for n protein ol ##igo ##mer ##ization , since del ##eti ##on of this region completely abolished the n protein self - multi ##mer ##ization . finally , the full - length nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein expressed and pu ##rified from ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system was found to form different levels of higher order structures as detected by western b ##lot analysis of the fraction ##ated proteins . collectively , these results may aid us in el ##uc ##ida ##ting the mechanism pertaining to formation of viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id core , and designing molecular approaches to intervene sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
objectives : following reports of patients with une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d pneumonia at the end of december 2019 in wu ##han , china , the ca ##usa ##tive agent was identified as corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , and the 2019 novel corona ##virus disease was named co ##vid - 19 by the world health organization . put ##ative patients with co ##vid - 19 have been identified in south korea , and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these patients . methods : upper and lower respiratory tract secret ##ion samples from put ##ative patients with co ##vid - 19 were in ##oc ##ulated onto cells to isolate the virus . full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus . results : the virus replicate ##d in ve ##ro cells and cy ##top ##athic effects were observed . full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homo ##logy of more than 99 . 9 % with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 which was isolated from patients from other countries , for instance china . sequence homo ##logy of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v was 77 . 5 % and 50 % , respectively . corona ##virus - specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in virus - infected ve ##ro cells . conclusion : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was isolated from put ##ative patients with une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever . the isolated virus was named beta ##co ##v / korea / kc ##dc ##0 ##3 / 2020 .  
abstract he ##pta ##d repeat regions ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) are highly conserved sequences located in the g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of enveloped viruses . they form a six - helix bundle structure and are important in the process of virus fusion . peptide ##s derived from the hr regions of some viruses have been shown to inhibit the entry of these viruses . sar ##s - co ##v was also predicted to have hr ##1 and hr ##2 regions in the s ##2 protein . based on this prediction , we designed 25 peptide ##s and screened them using a hiv - luc / sar ##s pseudo ##type ##d virus ass ##ay . two peptide ##s , hr ##1 - 1 and hr ##2 - 18 , were identified as potential inhibitors , with ec ##50 values of 0 . 14 and 1 . 19 ##μ ##m , respectively . the inhibitor ##y effects of these peptide ##s were valid ##ated by the wild - type sar ##s - co ##v ass ##ay . hr ##1 - 1 and hr ##2 - 18 can serve as functional probe ##s for di ##sse ##cting the fusion mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v and also provide the potential of further identifying potent inhibitors for sar ##s - co ##v entry .  
abstract inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication and might be valuable for sar ##s treatment . in this study , we demonstrate that treatment of ve ##ro e ##6 cells with inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 ( il - 4 ) decreased the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of these cells to sar ##s - co ##v infection . in contrast to if ##ns , il - 4 did not show anti ##vira ##l activity when administered immediately after sar ##s - co ##v infection , suggesting that il - 4 acts early during the sar ##s - co ##v replication cycle . indeed , binding of rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v spike protein to ve ##ro e ##6 cells was diminished on cells treated with il - 4 , but also on cells exposed to if ##n - γ . consistent with these observations , il - 4 and if ##n - γ down ##re ##gul ##ated cell surface expression of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the sar ##s - co ##v receptor . besides diminished ace ##2 cell surface expression , ace ##2 mrna levels were also decreased after treatment with these cy ##tok ##ines . these findings suggest that il - 4 and if ##n - γ inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication partly through down ##re ##gul ##ation of ace ##2 .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are a major infectious disease threat and include the pathogen ##ic human pathogen ##s of zoo ##not ##ic origin : severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . entry of co ##vs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike ( s ) protein , which is structurally categorized as a class i viral fusion protein , within the same group as influenza virus and hiv . however , s proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of pro ##tea ##ses . the exact location of the co ##v fusion peptide ( f ##p ) has been disputed . however , most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the s ##2 ′ cleavage site is the f ##p ( amino acids 79 ##8 – 81 ##8 sf ##ied ##ll ##f ##nk ##v ##tl ##ada ##gf ##m ##k ##q ##y for sar ##s - co ##v , f ##p ##1 ) . in our previous electron spin resonance spec ##tro ##scopic studies , the membrane - ordering effect of influenza virus , hiv , and deng ##ue virus f ##ps has been consistently observed . in this study , we used this effect as a criterion to identify and character ##ize the bon ##a fide sar ##s - co ##v f ##p . our results indicate that both f ##p ##1 and the region immediately downstream ( amino acids 81 ##6 – 83 ##5 k ##q ##y ##ge ##cl ##g ##dina ##rd ##lica ##q ##k ##f , f ##p ##2 ) induce significant membrane ordering . furthermore , their effects are calcium dependent , which is consistent with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for sar ##s - co ##v s - mediated fusion . iso ##thermal ti ##tra ##tion cal ##ori ##metry showed a direct interaction between calcium cat ##ions and both f ##ps . this ca ##2 + - dependency membrane ordering was not observed with influenza f ##p , indicating that the co ##v f ##p exhibits a me ##chan ##istic ##ally different behavior . membrane - ordering effects are greater and penetrate deeper into membranes when f ##p ##1 and f ##p ##2 act in a concert ##ed manner , suggesting that they form an extended fusion “ platform . ” 
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly infectious disease with a significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . respiratory failure is the major com ##plication , and patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome . health care workers are particularly vulnerable to sar ##s . sar ##s has the potential of being converted from drop ##let to airborne transmission . there is currently no proven effective treatment of sar ##s , so early recognition , isolation , and string ##ent infection control are the key to controlling this highly con ##tag ##ious disease . horseshoe bats are implicated in the emergence of novel corona ##virus infection in humans . further studies are needed to examine host genetic markers that may predict clinical outcome .  
abstract the high case - fatal ##ity rate of confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infections under ##lines the urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the disease severity and mortality . reg ##n ##30 ##51 and reg ##n ##30 ##48 are two fully human neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ) against mer ##s - co ##v that reduced virus replication in mice expressing human d ##pp ##4 upon prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic treatment . here , we evaluated the prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic efficacy of reg ##n ##30 ##48 and reg ##n ##30 ##51 in the common mar ##mos ##et model of mer ##s - co ##v infection . intra ##ven ##ous administration of mab resulted in high levels of mer ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing activity in circulating blood . when animals were treated with mab ##s one day before challenge , respiratory disease was less severe and , in animals treated with both reg ##n ##30 ##48 and reg ##n ##30 ##51 , viral loads in the lungs were reduced . however , therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less e ##ffi ##ca ##cious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bro ##nch ##oint ##ers ##ti ##tial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals . thus , mab administration may be more effective in a prop ##hyl ##actic treatment regime ##n rather than treatment of mer ##s .  
summary viruses with pan ##de ##mic potential including h ##1 ##n ##1 , h ##5 ##n ##1 , and h ##5 ##n ##7 influenza viruses , and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) / middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) have emerged in recent years . sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods , sometimes up to months . factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include : strain variation , ti ##tre , surface type , suspend ##ing medium , mode of deposition , temperature and relative humidity , and the method used to determine the via ##bility of the virus . environmental sampling has identified contamination in field - settings with sar ##s - co ##v and influenza virus , although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus . the importance of indirect contact transmission ( involving contamination of ina ##ni ##mate surfaces ) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes , principally direct contact transmission ( independent of surface contamination ) , drop ##let , and airborne routes . however , influenza virus and sar ##s - co ##v may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers . emerging data suggest that mer ##s - co ##v also shares these properties . once contaminated from the environment , hands can then initiate self - in ##oc ##ulation of mu ##cous membranes of the nose , eyes or mouth . mathematical and animal models , and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios . infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self - contamination and to protect against in ##oc ##ulation of mu ##cos ##al surfaces and the respiratory tract , and enhanced surface cleaning and di ##sin ##fect ##ion in healthcare settings .

abstract more than 200 chinese medicinal herb extracts were screened for anti ##vira ##l activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) using 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dime ##thy ##lth ##ia ##zo ##l - 2 - y ##l ) - 5 - ( 3 - car ##box ##yme ##th ##ox ##yp ##hen ##yl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sul ##fo ##ph ##en ##yl ) - 2 ##h - te ##tra ##zo ##lium inner salt ( mt ##s ) ass ##ay for virus - induced cy ##top ##athic effect ( cp ##e ) . four of these extracts showed moderate to potent anti ##vira ##l activities against sar ##s - co ##v with 50 % effective concentration ( ec ##50 ) ranging from 2 . 4 ##± ##0 . 2 to 88 . 2 ##± ##7 . 7 ##μ ##g / ml . out of the four , l ##y ##cor ##is ra ##dia ##ta was most potent . to identify the active component , l . ra ##dia ##ta extract was subjected to further fraction ##ation , purification , and cp ##e / mt ##s ass ##ays . this process led to the identification of a single substance l ##y ##cor ##ine as an anti - sar ##s - co ##v component with an ec ##50 value of 15 . 7 ##± ##1 . 2 ##n ##m . this compound has a cc ##50 value of 149 ##80 . 0 ##± ##9 ##12 . 0 ##n ##m in cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city ass ##ay and a selective index ( si ) greater than 900 . the results suggested that four herbal extracts and the compound l ##y ##cor ##ine are candidates for the development of new anti - sar ##s - co ##v drugs in the treatment of sar ##s .  
abstract the epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , designated sar ##s - co ##v . the rna genome of sar ##s - co ##v is complex ##ed by the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) to form a he ##lica ##l nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id . besides this primary function , n seems to be involved in ap ##op ##to ##tic scenarios . we show that upon infection of ve ##ro e ##6 cells with sar ##s - co ##v , which eli ##cit ##s a pronounced cy ##top ##athic effect and a high viral ti ##ter , n is cl ##ea ##ved by cas ##pas ##es . in contrast , in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ca ##co - 2 cells , which show a moderate cy ##top ##athic effect and a low viral ti ##ter , this processing of n was not observed . to further verify these observations , we transient ##ly expressed n in different cell lines . ca ##co - 2 and n ##2 ##a cells served as models for persistent sar ##s - co ##v infection , whereas ve ##ro e ##6 and a ##54 ##9 cells did as prototype cell lines l ##ytic ##ally infected by sar ##s - co ##v . the experiments revealed that n induce ##s the intrinsic ap ##op ##to ##tic pathway , resulting in processing of n at residues 400 and 403 by cas ##pas ##e - 6 and / or cas ##pas ##e - 3 . of note , cas ##pas ##e activation is highly cell type specific in sar ##s - co ##v - infected as well as transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed cells . in ca ##co - 2 and n ##2 ##a cells , almost no n - processing was detect ##able . in ve ##ro e ##6 and a ##54 ##9 cells , a high proportion of n was cl ##ea ##ved by cas ##pas ##es . moreover , we examined the sub ##cellular local ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v n in these cell lines . in trans ##fect ##ed ve ##ro e ##6 and a ##54 ##9 cells , sar ##s - co ##v n was localized both in the cy ##top ##las ##m and nucleus , whereas in ca ##co - 2 and n ##2 ##a cells , nearly no nuclear local ##ization was observed . in addition , our studies indicate that the nuclear local ##ization of n is essential for its cas ##pas ##e - 6 - mediated cleavage . these data suggest a correlation among the replication cycle of sar ##s - co ##v , sub ##cellular local ##ization of n , induction of ap ##op ##tosis , and the subsequent activation of cas ##pas ##es leading to cleavage of n .

abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease . after the appearance of an index patient in hong kong in february 2003 , sar ##s outbreak ##s occurred rapidly in hospitals and spread to the community . the aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a tri ##age policy and risk - st ##rat ##ified infection control measures in preventing nos ##oco ##mia ##l sar ##s infection among pa ##ed ##ia ##tric healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) at the prince of wales hospital , a general hospital to which children with sar ##s are referred in hong kong . the acute pa ##ed ##ia ##tric wards were st ##rat ##ified into three areas : ( 1 ) ultra high - risk area , ( 2 ) high - risk area and ( 3 ) moderate - risk area according to different risk levels of nos ##oco ##mia ##l sar ##s transmission . the implementation of different levels of infection control precautions was guided by this risk st ##rat ##ification strategy . between 13 march and 23 june , 38 patients with probable and suspected sar ##s , 90 patients with non - sar ##s pneumonia , and 510 patients without pneumonia were admitted into our unit . all probable sar ##s cases were isolated in negative - pressure rooms . twenty - six hc ##ws worked in the ultra high - risk area caring for sar ##s patients and 88 hc ##ws managed non - sar ##s patients in other ward areas . none of the hc ##ws developed clinical features suggest ##ive of sar ##s . in addition , there was no nos ##oco ##mia ##l spread of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus to other patients or visitors during this period . in conclusion , string ##ent infection control precautions , appropriate tri ##age and prompt isolation of potential sar ##s patients may have contributed to a lack of nos ##oco ##mia ##l spread and hc ##w acquisition of sar ##s in our unit .  
rna virus en ##codes a he ##lica ##se essential for viral rna transcription and replication when the genome size is larger than 7 kb . corona ##virus ( co ##v ) has an exceptionally large rna genome ( ~ 30 kb ) and it en ##codes an essential replica ##se , the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 13 ( ns ##p ##13 ) , a member of superfamily 1 he ##lica ##ses . ns ##p ##13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in co ##vs but also in ni ##do ##vira ##les . thus , it is considered as an important drug target . however , the high - resolution structure of co ##v ns ##p ##13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2003 , which hind ##ered the structure - based drug design . this is in part due to the intrinsic flexibility of ns ##p ##13 . here , we describe protocols of de ##du ##cing the crystal structure of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) he ##lica ##se in detail , which include protein expression , purification , crystal ##lization , en ##zy ##matic characterization , and structure determination . with these methods , catalytic ##ally active rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##13 protein can be prepared and crystal ##lized and the crystal structure can be solved .

summary middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) likely originated in bats and passed to humans through dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ; however , the genetic mechanisms underlying cross - species adaptation remain poorly understood . variation in the host receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , can block the interaction with the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and form a species barrier to infection . to better understand the species adapt ##ability of mer ##s - co ##v , we identified a sub ##op ##ti ##mal species - derived variant of d ##pp ##4 to study viral adapt ##ion . pass ##aging virus on cells expressing this d ##pp ##4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication . parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same d ##pp ##4 variant . structural analysis and functional ass ##ays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with sub ##op ##ti ##mal d ##pp ##4 by altering the surface charge of spike . these findings demonstrate that mer ##s - co ##v spike can utilize multiple paths to rapidly adapt to novel species variation in d ##pp ##4 .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an emerging zoo ##not ##ic viral respiratory disease that was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 . in 2015 , the largest mer ##s outbreak outside of the middle east region occurred in the republic of korea . the rapid nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in korean health care settings highlighted the importance and urgent need for a rapid and reliable on - site diagnostic ass ##ay to implement effective control and prevent ##ive measures . here , the evaluation and validation of two newly developed reverse transcription – ins ##ulated iso ##thermal pc ##r ( rt - ii ##pc ##r ) methods targeting the or ##f ##1 ##a and up ##e genes of mer ##s - co ##v are described . compared with world health organization - recommended single ##plex real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) ass ##ays , both rt - ii ##pc ##r ass ##ays had comparable analytical sensitivity for the detection of mer ##s - co ##v rna in tissue culture fluid and in sp ##ut ##um samples spiked with infectious virus . furthermore , clinical evaluation was performed with sp ##ut ##um samples collected from subjects with acute and chronic respiratory illnesses , including patients infected with mer ##s - co ##v . the overall agreement values between the two rt - ii ##pc ##r ass ##ays and the reference rt - q ##pc ##r ass ##ays were 98 . 06 % ( 95 % ci , 94 . 43 % – 100 % ; κ = 0 . 96 ) and 99 . 03 % ( 95 % ci , 95 . 88 % – 100 % ; κ = 0 . 99 ) for or ##f ##1 ##a and up ##e ass ##ays , respectively . the or ##f ##1 ##a and up ##e mer ##s - co ##v rt - ii ##pc ##r ass ##ays coupled with a field - deploy ##able system provide a platform for a highly sensitive and specific on - site tool for diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . future research on the molecular vi ##rol ##ogy of sar ##s - co ##v will be important in the understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and the natural history of sar ##s . this will also facilitate the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests , as well as va ##cci ##nation and other therapeutic ##s to combat sar ##s .  
summary two zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) — sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v — have crossed species to cause severe human respiratory disease . here , we showed that induction of air ##way memory cd ##4 + t cells specific for a conserved ep ##ito ##pe shared by sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v is a potential strategy for developing pan - corona ##virus vaccines . air ##way memory cd ##4 + t cells differed ph ##eno ##typical ##ly and functional ##ly from lung - derived cells and were crucial for protection against both co ##vs in mice . protection was dependent on inter ##fer ##on - γ and required early induction of robust innate and virus - specific cd ##8 + t cell responses . the conserved ep ##ito ##pe was also recognized in sar ##s - co ##v - and mer ##s - co ##v - infected human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen dr ##2 and dr ##3 trans ##genic mice , indicating potential relevance in human populations . additionally , this ep ##ito ##pe was cross - protective between human and bat co ##vs , the pro ##gen ##itors for many human co ##vs . vaccine strategies that induce air ##way memory cd ##4 + t cells targeting conserved ep ##ito ##pes might have broad app ##lica ##bility in the context of new co ##vs and other respiratory virus outbreak ##s .  
abstract to develop re ##age ##nts for early diagnosis and therapeutic drugs against sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a large ( 3 ##× ##10 ##9 ) im ##mun ##ized human antibody library was constructed from peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells from six sar ##s con ##vale ##scent patients . a single chain variable fragment antibody ( n ##18 ) with high affinity against n protein of sar ##s - co ##v was isolated . sequence analysis revealed that the v ##l gene was composed of v ##l ##3 ##h ( v lambda subgroup ) and j ##l ##2 regions and the v ##h gene was composed of vh1 - 69 ( vh1 subgroup ) , d ##2 - 15 , d ##3 - 22 and j ##h ##6 regions . soluble n ##18 antibody was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli h ##b ##21 ##51 , pu ##rified by ni – nt ##a affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy and verified by sd ##s - page and western b ##lot . the potential application for early diagnosis was evaluated using n protein capture elisa in which n ##18 antibody demonstrated high sensitive activity in detecting n protein of sar ##s - co ##v . finally , the potential useful ##ness of the n ##18 antibody in prop ##hyl ##ax ##is , vaccine design and therapy of sar ##s is discussed .  
abstract virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) produced by rec ##om ##bina ##nt expression of the major viral structural proteins could be an attractive method for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) control . in this study , using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system , we generated rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses that expressed s , e , m and n structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v either individually or simultaneously . the expression level , size and authenticity of each rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v protein were determined . in addition , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and fa ##cs analysis confirmed the cell surface expression of the s protein . co - infections of insect cells with two rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses demonstrated that m and e could assemble readily to form smooth surfaced v ##lp ##s . on the other hand , simultaneous high level expression of s , e and m by a single rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus allowed the very efficient assembly and release of v ##lp ##s . these data demonstrate that the v ##lp ##s are morphological mimic ##s of vi ##rion particles . the high level expression of v ##lp ##s with correct s protein conform ##ation by a single rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus offers a potential candidate vaccine for sar ##s .  
summary background the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is associated with a newly discovered corona ##virus , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##sco ##v ) . we did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of sar ##s . methods we tested clinical and post ##mo ##rte ##m samples from 43 ##6 sar ##s patients in six countries for infection with sar ##sco ##v , human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus , and other respiratory pathogen ##s . we infected four cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca fa ##sc ##icular ##is ) with sar ##s - co ##v in an attempt to replicate sar ##s and did nec ##rop ##sies on day 6 after infection . findings sar ##s - co ##v infection was diagnosed in 329 ( 75 % ) of 43 ##6 patients fitting the case definition of sar ##s ; human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus was diagnosed in 41 ( 12 % ) of 335 , and other respiratory pathogen ##s were diagnosed only sporadic ##ally . sar ##s - co ##v was , therefore , the most likely causal agent of sar ##s . the four sar ##s - co ##v - infected mac ##aq ##ues ex ##cre ##ted sar ##s - co ##v from nose , mouth , and ph ##ary ##nx from 2 days after infection . three of four mac ##aq ##ues developed diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , similar to that in sar ##s patients , and characterised by ep ##ith ##elial nec ##rosis , ser ##osa ##ng ##uin ##eous ex ##uda ##te , formation of h ##yal ##ine membranes , type 2 p ##ne ##um ##oc ##yte hyper ##pl ##asia , and the presence of sync ##yt ##ia . sar ##s - co ##v was detected in p ##ne ##um ##onic areas by virus isolation and rt - pc ##r , and was local ##ised to al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells and sync ##yt ##ia by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry and transmission electron microscopy . interpretation replication in sar ##s - co ##v - infected mac ##aq ##ues of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with sar ##s , combined with the high prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v infection in sar ##s patients , fulfill the criteria required to prove that sar ##s - co ##v is the primary cause of sar ##s . published online july 22 , 2003 http : / / image . the ##lance ##t . com / extras / 03 ##art ##6 ##31 ##8 ##we ##b . pdf 
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected at least 204 ##0 patients and caused 71 ##2 deaths since its first appearance in 2012 , yet neither pathogen - specific therapeutic ##s nor approved vaccines are available . to address this need , we are developing a subunit rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein vaccine comprising residues 37 ##7 – 58 ##8 of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , which , when formulated with the add ##ava ##x ad ##ju ##vant , it induce ##s a significant neutral ##izing antibody response and protection against mer ##s - co ##v challenge in va ##cci ##nated animals . to prepare for the manufacture and first - in - human testing of the vaccine , we have developed a process to stab ##ly produce the rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 protein in chinese ham ##ster o ##vary ( cho ) cells . to accomplish this , we trans ##fect ##ed an adhere ##nt di ##hy ##dro ##fo ##late red ##uc ##tase - def ##icient cho cell line ( ad ##cho ) with a pl ##as ##mi ##d encoding s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 fused with the human i ##gg fc fragment ( s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc ) . we then demonstrated the inter ##le ##uki ##n - 2 signal peptide - directed secret ##ion of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein into extra ##cellular mil ##ieu . using a gradually increasing met ##hot ##re ##xa ##te ( mt ##x ) concentration to 5 μ ##m , we increased protein yield by a factor of 40 . the ad ##cho - expressed s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein demonstrated functionality and binding specific ##ity identical to those of the protein from transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed he ##k ##29 ##3 ##t cells . in addition , hc ##d ##26 / dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) trans ##genic mice va ##cci ##nated with add ##ava ##x - ad ##ju ##vant ##ed s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc could produce neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v and survived for at least 21 days after challenge with live mer ##s - co ##v with no evidence of im ##mun ##ological toxicity or e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic immune enhancement . to prepare for large scale - manufacture of the vaccine antigen , we have further developed a high - yield mono ##cl ##onal suspension cho cell line .  
abstract the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the key protein for the formation of the he ##lica ##l nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id during vi ##rion assembly . this protein is believed to be more conserved than other proteins of the virus , such as spike and membrane g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . in this study , the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli dh ##5 ##α and identified with poole ##d sera from patients in the con ##vale ##sc ##ence phase of sar ##s . a pl ##as ##mi ##d pc ##i - n , encoding the full - length n gene of sar ##s - co ##v , was constructed . expression of the n protein was observed in co ##s ##1 cells following trans ##fect ##ion with pc ##i - n . the immune responses induced by intra ##mus ##cular im ##mun ##ization with pc ##i - n were evaluated in a mu ##rine model . serum anti - n im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins and sp ##len ##ocytes pro ##life ##rative responses against n protein were observed in im ##mun ##ized bal ##b / c mice . the major im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g sub ##class recognizing n protein was im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ##2 ##a , and stimulated sp ##len ##ocytes secret ##ed high levels of gamma inter ##fer ##on and il - 2 in response to n protein . more importantly , the im ##mun ##ized mice produced strong delayed - type hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity ( dt ##h ) and cd ##8 + ct ##l responses to n protein . the study shows that n protein of sar ##s - co ##v not only is an important b cell im ##mun ##ogen , but also can eli ##cit broad - based cellular immune responses . the results indicate that the n protein may be of potential value in vaccine development for specific prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and treatment against sar ##s .  
advanced age is a risk factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in humans . to understand its pathogen ##esis , we developed an animal model using bal ##b / c mice and the mouse - passage ##d frankfurt 1 isolate of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we examined the immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v in both young and adult mice . sar ##s - co ##v induced severe respiratory illness in all adult , but not young , mice on day 2 after in ##oc ##ulation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50 % . mori ##bund adult mice showed severe pulmonary ed ##ema and diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage accompanied by virus replication . adult mu ##rine lungs , which had significantly higher inter ##le ##uki ##n ( il ) - 4 and lower il - 10 and il - 13 levels before infection than young mu ##rine lungs , rapidly produced high levels of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory che ##mo ##kin ##es and cy ##tok ##ines known to induce macro ##pha ##ge and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil in ##filtration and activation ( e ##g , tumor nec ##rosis factor - α ) . on day 2 after in ##oc ##ulation , young mu ##rine lungs produced not only pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines but also il - 2 , inter ##fer ##on - γ , il - 10 , and il - 13 . adult mice showed early and acute excessive pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory responses ( ie , cy ##tok ##ine storm ) in the lungs after sar ##s - co ##v infection , which led to severe pulmonary ed ##ema and diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage . intra ##ven ##ous injection with anti - tumor nec ##rosis factor - α antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on sar ##s - co ##v infection . however , intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l inter ##fer ##on - γ injection protected adult mice from the lethal respiratory illness . the experimental model described here may be useful for el ##uc ##ida ##ting the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of sar ##s and for evaluating the ##ra ##pies to treat sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary background studies on the fusion - inhibitor ##y peptide ##s derived from the he ##pta ##d repeat 1 and 2 ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) regions of the hiv - 1 envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gp ##41 provided crucial information on the viral fu ##so ##genic mechanism . we used a similar approach to study the fu ##so ##genic mechanism of severe - acute - respiratory - syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . methods we tested the inhibitor ##y activity against infection of two sets of peptide ##s corresponding to sequences of sar ##s - co ##v spike protein hr ##1 and hr ##2 regions and investigated the interactions between the hr ##1 and hr ##2 peptide ##s by surface pl ##as ##mon resonance , sediment ##ation e ##quil ##ib ##ration analysis , circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm , native poly ##ac ##ryl ##ami ##de - gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is , size exclusion high - performance liquid ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy , and computer - aided homo ##logy modelling and molecule docking analysis . findings one peptide , cp - 1 , derived from the hr ##2 region , inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v infection in the micro ##mo ##lar range . cp - 1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the hr ##1 region , np - 1 . cp - 1 alone had low - he ##lic ##ity and self - associated to form a trim ##er in phosphate buffer ( ph 7 · 2 ) . cp - 1 and np - 1 mixed in e ##qui ##mo ##lar concentrations formed a six - helix bundle , similar to the fu ##so ##genic core structure of hiv - 1 gp ##41 . interpretation after binding to the target cell , the trans ##me ##mb ##rane spike protein might change conform ##ation by association between the hr ##1 and hr ##2 regions to form an ol ##igo ##meric structure , leading to fusion between the viral and target - cell membranes . at the pre ##fusion intermediate state , cp - 1 could bind to the hr ##1 region and interfere with the conform ##ation ##al changes , resulting in inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v fusion with the target cells . cp - 1 might be mod ##if ##iable to increase its anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity and could be further developed as an anti ##vira ##l agent for treatment or prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic and zoo ##not ##ic virus with a fatal ##ity rate in humans of over 35 % . although several vaccine candidates have been developed , there is still no clinical ##ly available vaccine for mer ##s - co ##v . in this study , we developed two types of mer ##s - co ##v vaccines : a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus ser ##otype 5 encoding the mer ##s - co ##v spike gene ( ad ##5 / mer ##s ) and spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les formulated with aluminum ( al ##um ) ad ##ju ##vant . next , we tested a het ##ero ##log ##ous prime – boost vaccine strategy , which compared pri ##ming with ad ##5 / mer ##s and boost ##ing with spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les and vice versa , with homo ##log ##ous prime – boost va ##cci ##nation comprising pri ##ming and boost ##ing with either spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les or ad ##5 / mer ##s . although both types of vaccine could induce specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g against mer ##s - co ##v , neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v were induced only by het ##ero ##log ##ous prime – boost im ##mun ##ization and homo ##log ##ous im ##mun ##ization with spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les . interesting ##ly , th ##1 cell activation was induced by im ##mun ##ization schedules including ad ##5 / mer ##s , but not by those including only spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les . het ##ero ##log ##ous prime – boost va ##cci ##nation regime ##ns including ad ##5 / mer ##s eli ##cite ##d simultaneous th ##1 and th ##2 responses , but homo ##log ##ous prime – boost regime ##ns did not . thus , het ##ero ##log ##ous prime – boost may induce longer - lasting immune responses against mer ##s - co ##v because of an appropriate balance of th ##1 / th ##2 responses . however , both het ##ero ##log ##ous prime – boost and homo ##log ##ous spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les va ##cci ##nation ##s could provide protection from mer ##s - co ##v challenge in mice . our results demonstrate that het ##ero ##log ##ous im ##mun ##ization by pri ##ming with ad ##5 / mer ##s and boost ##ing with spike protein nano ##par ##tic ##les could be an efficient prop ##hyl ##actic strategy against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary background in late december , 2019 , patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified micro ##bial agent were reported in wu ##han , china . a novel corona ##virus was subsequently identified as the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen , provisional ##ly named 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) . as of jan 26 , 2020 , more than 2000 cases of 2019 - nc ##ov infection have been confirmed , most of which involved people living in or visiting wu ##han , and human - to - human transmission has been confirmed . methods we did next - generation sequencing of samples from bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid and culture ##d isolate ##s from nine in ##patient ##s , eight of whom had visited the hua ##nan seafood market in wu ##han . complete and partial 2019 - nc ##ov genome sequences were obtained from these individuals . viral con ##ti ##gs were connected using sang ##er sequencing to obtain the full - length genome ##s , with the terminal regions determined by rapid amp ##li ##fication of cd ##na ends . phylogenetic analysis of these 2019 - nc ##ov genome ##s and those of other corona ##virus ##es was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help in ##fer its likely origin . homo ##logy modelling was done to explore the likely receptor - binding properties of the virus . findings the ten genome sequences of 2019 - nc ##ov obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar , exhibiting more than 99 · 98 % sequence identity . notably , 2019 - nc ##ov was closely related ( with 88 % identity ) to two bat - derived severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like corona ##virus ##es , bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 and bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 , collected in 2018 in zhou ##shan , eastern china , but were more distant from sar ##s - co ##v ( about 79 % ) and mer ##s - co ##v ( about 50 % ) . phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019 - nc ##ov fell within the subgenus sar ##be ##co ##virus of the genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 and bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 , and was genetically distinct from sar ##s - co ##v . notably , homo ##logy modelling revealed that 2019 - nc ##ov had a similar receptor - binding domain structure to that of sar ##s - co ##v , despite amino acid variation at some key residues . interpretation 2019 - nc ##ov is sufficiently diver ##gent from sar ##s - co ##v to be considered a new human - in ##fect ##ing beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host
summary background recently , the outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v infections caused worldwide attention to saudi arabia . the novel virus belongs to the corona ##virus ##es family , which is responsible for causing mild to moderate cold ##s . the control and command center of saudi ministry of health issues a daily report on mer ##s - co ##v infection cases . the infection with mer ##s - co ##v can lead to fatal complications , however little information is known about this novel virus . in this paper , we apply two data mining techniques in order to better understand the stability and the possibility of recovery from mer ##s - co ##v infections . method the naive bay ##es class ##ifier and j ##48 decision tree algorithm were used to build our models . the data ##set used consists of 108 ##2 records of cases reported between 2013 and 2015 . in order to build our prediction models , we split the data ##set into two groups . the first group combined recovery and death records . a new attribute was created to indicate the record type , such that the data ##set can be used to predict the recovery from mer ##s - co ##v . the second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute . results the resulting recovery models indicate that healthcare workers are more likely to survive . this could be due to the va ##cci ##nation ##s that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis . as for the stability models using j ##48 , two attributes were found to be important for predicting stability : sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic and age . old patients are at high risk of developing mer ##s - co ##v complications . finally , the performance of all the models was evaluated using three measures : accuracy , precision , and recall . in general , the accuracy of the models is between 53 . 6 % and 71 . 58 % . conclusion we believe that the performance of the prediction models can be enhanced with the use of more patient data . as future work , we plan to directly contact hospitals in ri ##yad ##h in order to collect more information related to patients with mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract an immune antibody ph ##age - display library was constructed from b cells of sar ##s con ##vale ##scent patients . more than 80 clones were selected from the library by using the whole inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s as target . one human sc ##f ##v , b1 , was characterized extensively . the b1 recognized sar ##s pseudo ##virus in vivo and competed with sar ##s sera for binding to sar ##s - co ##v with high affinity ( equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant , k d = 105 ##n ##m ) . the b1 also has potent neutral ##izing activities against infection by pseudo ##virus expressing sar ##s - co ##v s protein in vitro . finally , we found that the b1 recognized an ep ##ito ##pe on s ##2 protein , especially within amino acids 102 ##3 – 118 ##9 of s ##2 protein . this study not only first made a human neutral ##izing antibody , which recognized an ep ##ito ##pe on s ##2 protein like natural antibody in sera , but also may help us to better understand the im ##mun ##ological characteristics of sar ##s protein and sar ##s vaccine design .  
summary background the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the arabian peninsula , tunisia , morocco , france , italy , germany , and the uk . we provide a full description of a fatal case of mer ##s - co ##v infection and associated phylogenetic analyses . methods we report data for a patient who was admitted to the k ##lini ##ku ##m sc ##hwa ##bing ( munich , germany ) for severe acute respiratory infection . we did diagnostic rt - pc ##r and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence . from time of diagnosis , respiratory , fae ##cal , and urine samples were obtained for virus quan ##ti ##fication . we constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s . findings a 73 - year - old man from abu dhabi , united arab emirates , was transferred to k ##lini ##ku ##m sc ##hwa ##bing on march 19 , 2013 , on day 11 of illness . he had been diagnosed with multiple my ##elo ##ma in 2008 , and had received several lines of treatment . the patient died on day 18 , due to sept ##ic shock . mer ##s - co ##v was detected in two samples of bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar fluid . viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract ( up to 1 · 2 × 106 copies per ml ) . maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 269 ##1 rna copies per ml on day 13 ; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14 . stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus , with up to 103 ##1 rna copies per g ( close to the lowest detection limit of the ass ##ay ) . one of two oro ##nas ##al sw ##ab ##s obtained on day 16 were positive , but yielded little viral rna ( 53 ##70 copies per ml ) . no virus was detected in blood . the full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , co ##rre ##lating branch lengths with dates of isolation . the time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011 . addition of novel genome data from an un ##link ##ed case treated 6 months previously in essen , germany , showed a cluster ##ing of viruses derived from qatar and the united arab emirates . interpretation we have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of mer ##s - co ##v infection . mer ##s - co ##v might have shed ##ding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches . funding european union ; german centre for infection research ; german research
abstract the geographic spread and rapid increase in the cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by a novel corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) during the past two months have raised concern about its pan ##de ##mic potential . here we call for the rapid development of an effective and safe mer ##s vaccine to control the spread of mer ##s - co ##v .  
summary background in may 2015 , south korea reported its first case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in a 68 - year - old man with a history of travel in the middle east . in the presence of secondary infections , an understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus is crucial . the aim of this study was to character ##ize the transmission chains of mer ##s - co ##v infection in the current south korean outbreak . methods individual - level data from multiple sources were collected and used for ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analyses . results as of july 14 , 2015 , 185 confirmed cases of mer ##s have been reported in the korean outbreak . three generations of secondary infection , with over half belonging to the second generation , could be del ##ine ##ated . hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of virus transmission , affecting largely non - healthcare workers ( 154 / 184 ) . healthcare switching has probably accounted for the emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection . f ##omi ##te transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections occurring in the absence of direct contact with infected cases . conclusions publicly available data from multiple sources , including the media , are useful to describe the epidemic history of an outbreak . the effective control of mer ##s - co ##v hinges on the uphold ##ing of infection control standards and an understanding of health - seeking behaviour ##s in the community .  
abstract this is a prospective observation ##al study of a co ##hort of in ##patient ##s exposed to a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak . strict infection control policies were instituted . the 70 patients exposed to the sar ##s outbreak were isolated from the rest of the hospital . they were tri ##aged , qu ##aran ##tine ##d and co ##hort ##ed in three open plan wards . selective isolation was carried out immediately when symptoms and signs suspicious of sar ##s manifested clinical ##ly . the patients ' ages ranged from 21 to 90 years and 56 % had surgery before the qu ##aran ##tine . sixteen patients with une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d fever during the period of qu ##aran ##tine were isolated , seven of whom were eventually diagnosed with probable sar ##s . the crude incidence of sar ##s in our co ##hort was 10 % . the sar ##s case fatal ##ity was 14 % . no secondary transmission of the sar ##s virus within the co ##hort was observed . strict infection control , together with appropriate tri ##aging , co ##hort ##ing and selective isolation , is an effective and practical model of intervention in co ##hort ##s exposed to a sar ##s outbreak . such a management strategy ease ##s the log ##istic constraints imposed by demands for large numbers of isolation facilities in the face of a massive outbreak .

abstract progressive immune - associated injury is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . viral eva ##sion of innate immunity , hyper ##cy ##tok ##ine ##mia and systemic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) infected host have been suggested as possible mechanisms for the cause of severe pathology and mor ##bid ##ity in sar ##s patients . the molecular and cellular basis for how sar ##s co ##v impacts the host immune system resulting in severe sar ##s , however , has not been el ##uc ##ida ##ted . the variable clinical course of sar ##s may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent . therefore , the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to sar ##s co ##v is imperative in building as complete an im ##mun ##ological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness . here we review recent advances in sar ##s im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogen ##esis research and present a summary of our findings regarding host responses in sar ##s patients . we contend that d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated type i and ii inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) responses during sar ##s may cu ##lm ##inate in a failure of the switch from hyper - innate immunity to protective adaptive immune responses in the human host .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in 2002 – 03 caused mor ##bid ##ity in over 800 ##0 individuals and mortality in 74 ##4 in 29 countries . l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia along with ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia was a feature of sar ##s , as it is in respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus ( rs ##v ) and e ##bola infections , to name a few . direct in ##fest ##ation of l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s and macro ##pha ##ges by sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) has been debated as a cause of l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , but there is no convincing data . l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia can be caused by g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids , and thus any de ##bil ##itating condition has the potential to induce l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia via stress mechanism involving the h ##yp ##oth ##ala ##mic – pit ##uit ##ary – ad ##ren ##al axis . co ##rti ##sol levels are elevated in patients with rs ##v and e ##bola , and co ##rti ##sol was higher in sar ##s patients with l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia before any ste ##roid therapy . g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids also down - regulate the production of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory l ##ym ##ph ##oki ##nes . because of the ins ##idi ##ous presentation , sar ##s was treated with anti ##ba ##cter ##ial , anti ##vira ##l and su ##pr ##a - physiological doses of g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids . treatment with g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids complicated the issue regarding l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , and certainly calls into question the status of l ##ym ##ph ##oki ##nes and their pro ##gno ##stic implications in sar ##s .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) , including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , are zoo ##not ##ic pathogen ##s that originated in wild animals . hc ##ov ##s have large genome ##s that en ##code a fixed array of structural and non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural components , as well as a variety of accessory proteins that differ in number and sequence even among closely related co ##vs . thus , in addition to rec ##om ##bina ##tion and mutation , hc ##ov genome ##s evolve through gene gains and losses . in this review we sum ##mar ##ize recent findings on the molecular evolution of hc ##ov genome ##s , with special attention to rec ##om ##bina ##tion and adaptive events that generated new viral species and contributed to host shifts and to hc ##ov emergence . video abstract 
abstract cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is mediated by the viral spike ( s ) protein . amino acids 319 – 510 on the s protein have been mapped as the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , which media ##tes binding to the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) on sar ##s - co ##v susceptible cells . in this study , we expressed a fusion protein containing the human cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed rb ##d of the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein linked to the fc portion of human i ##gg ##1 ( named rb ##d - fc ) in he ##k ##29 ##3 cells . the rb ##d - fc protein was pu ##rified by affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy . the flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry ass ##ay showed that the pu ##rified rb ##d - fc protein could bind to ace ##2 . we demonstrated that the rb ##d spike protein alone could be internal ##ized into sar ##s - co ##v susceptible cells together with ace ##2 . we also showed that the removal of n - g ##ly ##cans from the rb ##d spike protein did not ab ##olis ##h this phenomenon . our discoveries may have some implications for the development of the sar ##s vaccine .  
abstract receptor recognition is a major deter ##mina ##nt of the host range , cross - species infections , and pathogen ##esis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . a defined receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein specifically recognizes its host receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . this article reviews the latest knowledge about how rb ##ds from different sar ##s - co ##v strains interact with ace ##2 from several animal species . detailed research on these rb ##d / ace ##2 interactions has established important principles on host receptor adaptations , cross - species infections , and future evolution of sar ##s - co ##v . these principles may apply to other emerging animal viruses , including the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ” .  
abstract development of an effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) remains to be a priority to prevent possible re - emergence of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we previously demonstrated that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v s protein is a major target of neutral ##izing antibodies . this suggests that the rb ##d may serve as an ideal vaccine candidate . rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##o - associated virus ( ra ##av ) has been proven to be an effective system for gene delivery and vaccine development . in this study , a novel vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v was developed based on the ra ##av delivery system . the gene encoding rb ##d was clone ##d into a pa ##av - ir ##es - hr ##gf ##p pl ##as ##mi ##d . the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity induced by the resulting rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d - ra ##av was evaluated in bal ##b / c mice . the results demonstrated that ( 1 ) a single dose of rb ##d - ra ##av va ##cci ##nation could induce sufficient neutral ##izing antibody against sar ##s - co ##v infection ; ( 2 ) two more repeated doses of the va ##cci ##nation boosted the neutral ##izing antibody to about 5 times of the level achieved by a single dose of the im ##mun ##ization and ( 3 ) the level of the antibody continued to increase for the entire duration of the experiment of 5 . 5 months . these results suggested that rb ##d - ra ##av is a promising sar ##s candidate vaccine .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) have been considered to be relatively harmless respiratory pathogen ##s in the past . however , after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , hc ##ov ##s have received worldwide attention as important pathogen ##s in respiratory tract infection . this review focuses on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , pathogen ##esis and clinical characteristics among sar ##s ‐ corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) , mer ##s ‐ co ##v and other hc ##ov infections .  
abstract the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a new type of corona ##virus , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . cd ##8 t cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other corona ##virus ##es and in media ##ting vaccine - induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models . the spike protein , a main surface antigen of sar ##s - co ##v , is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design . overlapping peptide ##s were used to identify major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex class i - restricted ep ##ito ##pes in mice im ##mun ##ized with vectors encoding cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed sar ##s - co ##v spike protein . cd ##8 t - cell responses were mapped to two h - 2 ##b - restricted ep ##ito ##pes ( s ##43 ##6 – 44 ##3 and s ##52 ##5 – 53 ##2 ) and one h - 2d - restricted ep ##ito ##pe ( s ##36 ##6 – 37 ##4 ) . the identification of these ep ##ito ##pes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in mu ##rine models of sar ##s - co ##v infection . furthermore , cod ##on and promoter optimization ##s can greatly enhance the overall im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of spike protein in the context of replication - defective human and simi ##an aden ##ov ##ira ##l vaccine carriers . the opt ##imi ##zed rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##ira ##l vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigen - specific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v still a major concern in most of dai ##gno ##stic laboratories . to date the real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) is the main ##sta ##y for diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v . rt - pc ##r has limitations , including a long turn ##around time and lack of common measurements and correlation ##s with viral load ( v ##l ) . it is recommended to screen for mer ##s - co ##v using rt - pc ##r of the upstream of envelope gene ( up ##e ) followed by confirmation of the presence of one of the following genes ; open reading frame 1a , 1b genes or nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) gene . scientists are looking to implement viral sequencing on all negative samples by rt - pc ##r and they bel ##ei ##ve that can be exposed to another level of testing using sequencing of the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) gene or n gene and in this case a positive result is diagnostic . it is also very important to maintain a con ##tine ##ous and random sequencing for mer ##s - co ##v samples to be able to pick early viral mutations . ser ##ological ass ##ays still not widely or routinely performed , and a lot of studies looking to implement such method in routine patient ' s testing ##s .  
the outbreak of a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 ) since december 2019 in wu ##han , the major transportation hub in central china , became an emergency of major international concern . while several et ##iol ##ogical studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus , the epidemic characteristics need to be el ##uc ##ida ##ted . notably , a long inc ##uba ##tion time was reported to be associated with sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 infection , leading to adjustments in screening and control policies . to avoid the risk of virus spread , all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days , which is the longest predicted inc ##uba ##tion time . however , based on our analysis of a larger data ##set available so far , we find there is no ob ##ser ##vable difference between the inc ##uba ##tion time for sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , highlighting the need for larger and well ‐ ann ##ota ##ted data ##set ##s .  
summary children are susceptible to infection by sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) but the clinical picture of sar ##s is mild ##er than in adults . teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation . fever , mala ##ise , cough , cory ##za , chill ##s or rig ##or , sp ##ut ##um production , headache , my ##al ##gia , le ##uc ##opa ##enia , l ##ym ##ph ##opa ##enia , th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##ae ##nia , mildly prolonged activated partial th ##rom ##bo ##pl ##ast ##in times and elevated lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase levels are common presenting features . radio ##graphic findings are non - specific but high - resolution computed tom ##ography of the thor ##ax in clinical ##ly suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radio ##graphs appear normal . the improved reverse transcription - polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays are critical in the early diagnosis of sar ##s , with sensitivity approaching 80 % in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates , the preferred specimens . absence of ser ##oco ##n ##version to sar ##s - co ##v beyond 28 days from disease onset generally exclude ##s the diagnosis . the best treatment strategy for sar ##s among children remains to be determined . no case fatal ##ity has been reported in children and the short - to medium - term outcome appears to be good . the importance of continued monitoring for any long - term complications due to the disease or its em ##pi ##ric treatment , cannot be over ##em ##pha ##sis ##ed .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sar ##s ) is a corona ##virus that ins ##ti ##gated regional epidemic ##s in canada and several asian countries in 2003 . the newly identified sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) can be transmitted among humans and cause severe or even fatal illnesses . as prevent ##ive vaccine development takes years to complete and adverse reactions have been reported to some veterinary corona ##vira ##l vaccines , anti - viral compounds must be relentless ##ly pursued . in this study , we analyzed the effect of au ##rin ##tric ##ar ##box ##yl ##ic acid ( ata ) on sar ##s - co ##v replication in cell culture , and found that ata could drastically inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication , with viral production being 1000 - fold less than that in the un ##tre ##ated control . importantly , when compared with if ##ns α and β , viral production was inhibit ##ed by more than 1000 - fold as compared with the un ##tre ##ated control . in addition , when compared with if ##ns α and β , ata was approximately 10 times more potent than if ##n α and 100 times more than inter ##fer ##on β at their highest concentrations reported in the literature previously . our data indicated that ata should be considered as a candidate anti - sar ##s compound for future clinical evaluation .  
within last 17 years two widespread epidemic ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred in china , which were caused by related corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) : sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . although the origin ( s ) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious , some general patterns of their pathogen ##esis and epidemic ##s are noticeable . both viruses utilize the same receptor — ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) — for invading human bodies . both epidemic ##s occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays , and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion . thus , if bats were the natural hosts of sar ##s - co ##vs , cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide con ##du ##ci ##ve environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats . the widespread existence of these bat - carried or - released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable . once succeeding in making some initial human infections , spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel . these natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the sar ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . however , some unique factors might also contribute to the origin ##ation of sar ##s in wu ##han . these factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation .
