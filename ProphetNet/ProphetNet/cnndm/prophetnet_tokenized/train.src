background : the human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the et ##iology of infectious diseases and auto ##im ##mun ##e disorders . during the taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , many health care workers were infected . in an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal , the distribution of h ##la class i and ii all ##eles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic su ##sc ##ept ##ibly or resistance to sar ##s corona ##virus infection . methods : h ##la - class i and ii all ##ele typing by pc ##r - ss ##op was performed on 37 cases of probable sar ##s , 28 fever patients excluded later as probable sar ##s , and 101 non - infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to sar ##s corona ##virus . an additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated taiwanese was also used in the analysis . results : woolf and hal ##dan ##e odds ratio ( or ) and corrected p - value ( pc ) obtained from two tails fisher exact test were used to show su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of h ##la class i or class ii all ##eles with corona ##virus infection . at first , when analyzing infected sar ##s patients and high risk health care workers groups , h ##la - b * 460 ##1 ( or = 2 . 08 , p = 0 . 04 , pc = n . s . ) and h ##la - b * 540 ##1 ( or = 5 . 44 , p = 0 . 02 , pc = n . s . ) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favor ##ing sar ##s corona ##virus infection . after selecting only a severe cases patient group from the infected probable sar ##s patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group , the severity of sar ##s was shown to be significantly associated with h ##la - b * 460 ##1 ( p = 0 . 000 ##8 or pc = 0 . 02 ##7 ##9 ) . conclusions : densely populated regions with genetically related southern asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of sar ##s infection . up until recently , no probable sar ##s patients were reported among taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the taiwanese general population , have no h ##la - b * 460 ##1 and have high frequency of h ##la - b * 130 ##1 . while increase of h ##la - b * 460 ##1 all ##ele frequency was observed in the probable sar ##s infected patient group , a further significant increase of the all ##ele was seen in the severe cases patient group . these results appeared to indicate association of h ##la -
background : an epidemic of a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by a new corona ##virus has spread from the guangdong province to the rest of china and to the world , with a pu ##zzling con ##tag ##ion behavior . it is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prop ##hyl ##actic measures , to identify the causes of this behavior . results : in this report , we show first that the standard susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread . we develop a model involving two super ##im ##posed epidemic ##s to study the recent spread of the sar ##s in hong kong and in the region . we explore the situation where these epidemic ##s may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tr ##op ##ism , or by two unrelated viruses . this has important consequences for the future : the inn ##oc ##uous epidemic might still be there and generate , from time to time , variants that would have properties similar to those of sar ##s . conclusion : we find that , in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease , it is convenient to suggest that a first mild ##er outbreak protected against the sar ##s . regions that had not seen the first epidemic , or that were affected simultaneously with the sar ##s suffered much more , with a very high percentage of persons affected . we also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent , suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of sar ##s patients . finally , we could , within the framework of the model , fix limits to the future development of the epidemic , allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic . the model also suggests that there might exist a sar ##s precursor in a large reservoir , prompting for implementation of pre ##ca ##ution ##ary measures when the weather cool ##s down .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a feb ##ril ##e respiratory illness . the disease has been et ##iol ##ogical ##ly linked to a novel corona ##virus that has been named the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , whose genome was recently sequence ##d . since it is a member of the corona ##vir ##idae , its spike protein ( s ##2 ) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes . the protein responsible for viral - induced membrane fusion of hiv - 1 ( gp ##41 ) differs in length , and has no sequence homo ##logy with s ##2 . results : sequence analysis reveals that the two viral proteins share the sequence motifs that construct their active conform ##ation . these include ( 1 ) an n - terminal le ##uc ##ine / iso ##le ##uc ##ine zipper - like sequence , and ( 2 ) a c - terminal he ##pta ##d repeat located upstream of ( 3 ) an aromatic residue - rich region ju ##xt ##ap ##osed to the ( 4 ) trans ##me ##mb ##rane segment . conclusions : this study points to a similar mode of action for the two viral proteins , suggesting that anti - viral strategy that targets the viral - induced membrane fusion step can be adopted from hiv - 1 to sar ##s - co ##v . recently the fda approved en ##fu ##vir ##ti ##de , a synthetic peptide corresponding to the c - terminal he ##pta ##d repeat of hiv - 1 gp ##41 , as an anti - aids agent . en ##fu ##vir ##ti ##de and c ##34 , another anti hiv - 1 peptide , ex ##ert their inhibitor ##y activity by binding to a le ##uc ##ine / iso ##le ##uc ##ine zipper - like sequence in gp ##41 , thus inhibit ##ing a conform ##ation ##al change of gp ##41 required for its activation . we suggest that peptide ##s corresponding to the c - terminal he ##pta ##d repeat of the s ##2 protein may serve as inhibitors for sar ##s - co ##v entry .  
background : the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused a severe global epidemic in 2003 which led to hundreds of deaths and many thousands of hospital ##izations . the virus causing sar ##s was identified as a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and multiple gen ##omic sequences have been revealed since mid - april , 2003 . after a quiet summer and fall in 2003 , the newly emerged sar ##s cases in asia , particularly the latest cases in china , are rein ##for ##cing a wide - spread belief that the sar ##s epidemic would strike back . with the understanding that sar ##s - co ##v might be with humans for years to come , knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the sar ##s - co ##v , including its mutation rate and emergence time , is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen . to date , the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the el ##ap ##sed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood . results : sixteen complete gen ##omic sequences with available clinical histories during the sar ##s outbreak were analyzed . after careful examination of multiple - sequence alignment , 114 single nu ##cle ##otide variations were identified . to minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional mutations during the cell culture , three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1 ) using the closely related sequences as background controls ; 2 ) adjusting the diver ##gence time for cell culture ; or 3 ) using the common variants only . the mutation rate in the sar ##s - co ##v genome was estimated to be 0 . 80 – 2 . 38 × 10 ( - 3 ) nu ##cle ##otide substitution per site per year which is in the same order of magnitude as other rna viruses . the non - synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1 . 16 – 3 . 30 × 10 ( - 3 ) and 1 . 67 – 4 . 67 × 10 ( - 3 ) per site per year , respectively . the most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was in ##fer ##red to be present as early as the spring of 2002 . conclusions : the estimated mutation rates in the sar ##s - co ##v using multiple strategies were not unusual among corona ##virus ##es and moderate compared to those in other rna viruses . all estimates of mutation rates led to the inference that the sar ##s - co ##v could have been with humans in the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic .  
background : a new respiratory infectious epidemic , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , broke out and spread throughout the world . by now the put ##ative pathogen of sar ##s has been identified as a new corona ##virus , a single positive - strand rna virus . rna viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation . it is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the sar ##s corona ##virus as it spreads through the population . moreover , finding a date for the last common ancestor of sar ##s corona ##virus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic and the rate at which sar ##s corona ##virus diver ##ge . methods : we propose a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the sar ##s corona ##virus genome and the time of the last common ancestor of the sequence ##d sar ##s strains . under some common assumptions and just ##if ##iable sim ##pl ##ification ##s , a few simple equations incorporating the evolution rate ( k ) and time of the last common ancestor of the strains ( t ( 0 ) ) can be de ##duced . we then implemented the least square method to estimate k and t ( 0 ) from the data ##set of sequences and corresponding times . monte carlo stimulation was employed to discuss the results . results : based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death , we estimated the time of the last common ancestor to be about august or september 2002 , and the evolution rate to be about 0 . 16 base / day , that is , the sar ##s corona ##virus would on average change a base every seven days . we valid ##ated our method by dividing the strains into two groups , which coincided with the results from comparative gen ##omics . conclusion : the applied method is simple to implement and avoid the difficulty and subject ##ivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree . based on 6 strains with accurate date of host death , we estimated a time of the last common ancestor , which is coincide ##nt with epidemic investigations , and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the hiv - 1 virus .  
background : the sar ##s corona ##virus is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent for the epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome . the recent emergence of this new pathogen , the careful tracing of its transmission patterns , and the ability to prop ##aga ##te in culture allows the exploration of the mutation ##al dynamics of the sar ##s - co ##v in human populations . methods : we sequence ##d complete sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s taken from primary human tissues ( sin ##34 ##0 ##8 , sin ##37 ##25 ##v , sin ##37 ##65 ##v ) , culture ##d isolate ##s ( sin ##8 ##48 , sin ##8 ##46 , sin ##8 ##42 , sin ##8 ##45 , sin ##8 ##47 , sin ##8 ##49 , sin ##85 ##0 , sin ##85 ##2 , sin ##34 ##0 ##8 ##l ) , and five consecutive ve ##ro cell passages ( sin ##27 ##7 ##4 _ p ##1 , sin ##27 ##7 ##4 _ p ##2 , sin ##27 ##7 ##4 _ p ##3 , sin ##27 ##7 ##4 _ p ##4 , sin ##27 ##7 ##4 _ p ##5 ) arising from sin ##27 ##7 ##4 isolate . these represented individual patient samples , serial in vitro passages in cell culture , and paired human and cell culture isolate ##s . employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model , the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated . phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolate ##s . results : close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s identified before 14 ( th ) october 2003 , including 22 from patients in singapore , revealed the mutations eng ##end ##ered during human - to - ve ##ro and ve ##ro - to - human transmission as well as in multiple ve ##ro cell passages in order to ref ##ine our analysis of human - to - human transmission . though co - infection by different quasi ##pe ##cies in individual tissue samples is observed , the in vitro mutation rate of the sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro cell passage is ne ##gli ##gible . the in vivo mutation rate , however , is consistent with estimates of other rna viruses at approximately 5 . 7 × 10 ( - 6 ) nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s per site per day ( 0 . 17 mutations per genome per day ) , or two mutations per human passage ( adjusted r - square = 0 . 401 ##4 ) . using the immediate hotel m contact isolate ##s as roots , we observed that the sar ##s epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated : two singapore isolate ##s , one taiwan isolate , and one north china isolate which appears most closely related to the put ##ative sar ##s - co ##v isolated from a palm ci ##vet . non
background : the molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) induced pathology is still largely unclear . many sar ##s patients suffer respiratory distress brought on by inter ##sti ##tial in ##filtration and frequently show peripheral blood l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and occasional le ##uc ##open ##ia . one possible cause of this could be inter ##sti ##tial inflammation , following a localized host response . in this study , we therefore examine the immune response of sar ##s - co ##v in human peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) over the first 24 hours . methods : p ##bm ##cs from normal healthy donors were in ##oc ##ulated in vitro with sar ##s - co ##v and the viral replication kinetic ##s was studied by real - time quantitative ass ##ays . sar ##s - co ##v specific gene expression changes were examined by high - density ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide array analysis . results : we observed that sar ##s - co ##v was capable of in ##fect ##ing and replica ##ting in p ##bm ##cs and the kinetic ##s of viral replication was variable among the donors . sar ##s - co ##v antibody binding ass ##ays indicated that sar ##s specific antibodies inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v viral replication . array data showed mono ##cy ##te - macro ##pha ##ge cell activation , coa ##gul ##ation pathway up ##re ##gul ##ation and cy ##tok ##ine production together with lung trafficking che ##mo ##kin ##es such as il ##8 and il ##17 , possibly activated through the t ##lr ##9 signaling pathway ; that mimic ##ked clinical features of the disease . conclusions : the identification of human blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells as a direct target of sar ##s - co ##v in the model system described here provides a new insight into disease pathology and a tool for investigating the host response and mechanisms of pathogen ##esis .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in later february 2003 , as a new epidemic form of life - threatening infection caused by a novel corona ##virus . however , the immune - pathogen ##esis of sar ##s is poorly understood . to understand the host response to this pathogen , we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) derived from sar ##s patients , and compared with healthy controls . results : the number of differential ##ly expressed genes was found to be 186 under string ##ent filtering criteria of micro ##ar ##ray data analysis . several genes were highly up - regulated in patients with sar ##s , such as , the genes coding for lac ##to ##fer ##rin , s ##100 ##a ##9 and lip ##oca ##lin 2 . the real - time pc ##r method verified the results of the gene array analysis and showed that those genes that were up - regulated as determined by micro ##ar ##ray analysis were also found to be comparatively up - regulated by real - time pc ##r analysis . conclusions : this differential gene expression prof ##iling of p ##bm ##cs from patients with sar ##s strongly suggests that the response of sar ##s affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response , rather than a specific immune response against a viral infection , as we observed a complete lack of cy ##tok ##ine genes usually triggered during a viral infection . our study shows for the first time how the immune system responds to the sar ##s infection , and opens new possibilities for designing new diagnostic ##s and treatments for this new life - threatening disease .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus that leads to del ##eter ##ious pulmonary path ##ological features . due to its high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality and widespread occurrence , sar ##s has evolved as an important respiratory disease which may be encountered everywhere in the world . the virus was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s due to the efforts of a who - led laboratory network . the potential mu ##ta ##bility of the sar ##s - co ##v genome may lead to new sar ##s outbreak ##s and several regions of the viral genome ##s open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe vi ##ru ##lence of the virus . with regard to the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s , several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist . va ##cci ##nation would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemic ##s of sar ##s , but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system - virus interactions and the potential mu ##ta ##bility of the virus . even in a situation of no new infections , sar ##s remains a major health hazard , as new epidemic ##s may arise . therefore , further experimental and clinical research is required to control the disease .  
background : ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations of infectious disease are mainly dependent on indirect contact information and only occasionally assisted by characterization of pathogen sequence variation from clinical isolate ##s . direct sequence analysis of the pathogen , particularly at a population level , is generally thought to be too cum ##bers ##ome , technically difficult , and expensive . we present here a novel application of mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ( ms ) – based technology in character ##izing viral sequence variations that overcome ##s these problems , and we apply it retrospective ##ly to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in singapore . methods and findings : the success rate of the ms - based analysis for detecting sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) sequence variations was determined to be 95 % with 75 copies of viral rna per reaction , which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and culture ##d samples . analysis of 13 sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s from the different stages of the singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new , previously unidentified , primary route of introduction of sar ##s - co ##v into the singapore population . our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an un ##res ##olved ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link regarding the acquisition of sar ##s in a german patient . we were also able to detect het ##ero ##gen ##eous viral sequences in primary lung tissues , suggesting a possible coe ##vo ##lu ##tion of quasi ##sp ##ec ##ies of virus within a single host . conclusion : this study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the ms - based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for character ##izing sar ##s - co ##v genetic variations in clinical samples . we suggest that this approach should be used routinely during outbreak ##s of a wide variety of agents , in order to allow the most effective control .  
in the aftermath of the sar ##s epidemic , there has been significant progress in understanding the molecular and cell biology of sar ##s - co ##v . some of the milestone ##s are the availability of viral genome sequence , identification of the viral receptor , development of an infectious cd ##na clone , and the identification of viral antigen ##s that eli ##cit neutral ##izing antibodies . however , there is still a large gap in our understanding of how sar ##s - co ##v interact ##s with the host cell and the rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation . now the sar ##s - co ##v story has entered a new phase , a search for prevent ##ive strategies and a cure for the disease . this review highlights the progress made in identifying molecular aspects of sar ##s - co ##v biology that is relevant in developing disease prevention strategies . authors conclude that development of successful sar ##s - co ##v vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls depends on the progress we make in these areas in the immediate future .  
human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is a functional receptor for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . here we identify the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) - protein - binding site on ace ##2 . we also compare s proteins of sar ##s - co ##v isolated during the 2002 – 2003 sar ##s outbreak and during the much less severe 2003 – 2004 outbreak , and from palm ci ##vet ##s , a possible source of sar ##s - co ##v found in humans . all three s proteins bound to and utilized palm - ci ##vet ace ##2 efficiently , but the latter two s proteins utilized human ace ##2 markedly less efficiently than did the s protein obtained during the earlier human outbreak . the lower affinity of these s proteins could be complement ##ed by altering specific residues within the s - protein - binding site of human ace ##2 to those of ci ##vet ace ##2 , or by altering s - protein residues 47 ##9 and 48 ##7 to residues conserved during the 2002 – 2003 outbreak . collectively , these data describe molecular interactions important to the adaptation of sar ##s - co ##v to human cells , and provide insight into the severity of the 2002 – 2003 sar ##s epidemic .  
a series of frames ##hi ##ft mutations within the 3a gene has been observed in culture - derived severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we report here that viral rna from clinical samples obtained from sar ##s - co ##v infected patients also contains a het ##ero ##gen ##eous population of wild - type and mutant 3a transcript ##s .  
the genus corona ##virus contains about 25 species of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , which are important pathogen ##s causing highly prevalent diseases and often severe or fatal in humans and animals . no licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection . different host receptors for cellular entry , poorly conserved structural proteins ( antigen ##s ) , and the high mutation and rec ##om ##bina ##tion rates of co ##vs pose a significant problem in the development of wide - spectrum anti - co ##v drugs and vaccines . co ##v main pro ##tea ##ses ( m ( pro ) s ) , which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication , were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate - recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homo ##logy model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus corona ##virus . this conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity ass ##ays . mechanism - based ir ##re ##vers ##ible inhibitors were designed , based on this conserved structural region , and a uniform inhibition mechanism was el ##uc ##ida ##ted from the structures of m ( pro ) - inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome - co ##v and por ##cine trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus . a structure - assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro ina ##ct ##ivation of multiple co ##v m ( pro ) s , potent anti ##vira ##l activity , and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell - based ass ##ays . further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging co ##v - related diseases .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a newly discovered corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . no effective prop ##hyl ##actic or post - exposure therapy is currently available . results : we report , however , that ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e has strong anti ##vira ##l effects on sar ##s - co ##v infection of primate cells . these inhibitor ##y effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus , suggesting both prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic advantage . in addition to the well - known functions of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e such as elevations of end ##osomal ph , the drug appears to interfere with terminal g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of the cellular receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 . this may negatively influence the virus - receptor binding and ab ##rogate the infection , with further ram ##ification ##s by the elevation of ve ##sic ##ular ph , resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of sar ##s co ##v at clinical ##ly ad ##missible concentrations . conclusion : ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e is effective in preventing the spread of sar ##s co ##v in cell culture . favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e prior to or after sar ##s co ##v infection . in addition , the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay described here ##in represents a simple and rapid method for screening sar ##s - co ##v anti ##vira ##l compounds .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v is a newly emerging virus that causes sar ##s with high mortality rate in infected people . successful control of the global sar ##s epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread , as well as , the development of vaccines and new anti ##vira ##l compounds including neutral ##izing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease . methods : the human synthetic single - chain fragment variable ( sc ##f ##v ) et ##h - 2 ph ##age antibody library was used for the isolation of sc ##f ##vs against the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v using a bio pan ##ning - based strategy . the selected sc ##f ##vs were characterized under genetics - molecular aspects and for sar ##s - co ##v n protein detection in elisa , western b ##lot ##ting and im ##mun ##oc ##yt ##oche ##mist ##ry . results : human sc ##f ##v antibodies to n protein of sar ##s - co ##v can be easily isolated by selecting the et ##h - 2 ph ##age library on im ##mun ##ot ##ub ##es coated with antigen . these in vitro selected human sc ##f ##vs specifically recognize in elisa and western b ##lot ##ting studies distinct ep ##ito ##pes in n protein domains and detect in im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry investigations sar ##s - co ##v particles in infected ve ##ro cells . conclusion : the human sc ##f ##v antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful re ##age ##nts for rapid detection of n sar ##s - co ##v protein and sar ##s virus particles in infected target cells .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a recent epidemic human disease , is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . first reported in asia , sar ##s quickly spread worldwide through international travelling . as of july 2003 , the world health organization reported a total of 8 , 43 ##7 people af ##flict ##ed with sar ##s with a 9 . 6 % mortality rate . although im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress , little is known about how the genome - wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of sar ##s - co ##v . results : based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood , we identified 52 signature genes that accurately disc ##rim ##inated acute sar ##s patients from non - sar ##s controls . while a general suppression of gene expression pre ##dom ##inated in sar ##s - infected blood , several genes including those involved in innate immunity , such as def ##ens ##ins and e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l - derived ne ##uro ##to ##xin , were up ##re ##gul ##ated . instead of employing cluster ##ing methods , we ranked the severity of recovering sar ##s patients by generalized associate plots ( gap ) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes . through this method , we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute sar ##s patients . the rank of sar ##s severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period ( in days ) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score . conclusion : the use of the gap approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems . the severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further el ##uc ##ida ##ting the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of their disease .  
background : the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was a newly emerged infectious disease which caused a global epidemic in 2002 – 2003 . sequence analysis of sar ##s - corona ##virus isolate ##s revealed that specific gen ##otype ##s pre ##dom ##inated at different periods of the epidemic . this information can be used as a footprint for tracing the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of infections and monitor viral evolution . however , direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cum ##bers ##ome and time consuming . we present here a simple and rapid ass ##ay for the screening of sar ##s - corona ##virus gen ##otype ##s based on the use of flu ##oro ##genic ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide probe ##s for all ##eli ##c discrimination . methods : thirty sar ##s patients were recruited . all ##eli ##c discrimination ass ##ays were developed based on the use of flu ##oro ##genic ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide probe ##s ( ta ##q ##man ) . gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of the sar ##s - corona ##virus isolate ##s obtained from these patients were carried out by the all ##eli ##c discrimination ass ##ays and confirmed by direct sequencing . results : gen ##ot ##yp ##ing based on the all ##eli ##c discrimination ass ##ays were fully concord ##ant with direct sequencing . all of the 30 sar ##s - corona ##virus gen ##otype ##s studied were characteristic of gen ##otype ##s previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic . seven of the isolate ##s contained a previously reported major del ##eti ##on but in patients not ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly related to the previously studied co ##hort . conclusion : we have developed a simple and accurate method for the characterization and screening of sar ##s - corona ##virus gen ##otype ##s . it is a promising tool for the study of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological relationships between documented cases during an outbreak .  
background : cellular local ##ization of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in the lungs of patients with sar ##s is important in confirming the et ##iol ##ogical association of the virus with disease as well as in understanding the pathogen ##esis of the disease . to our knowledge , there have been no comprehensive studies investigating viral infection at the cellular level in humans . methods and findings : we collected the largest series of fatal cases of sar ##s with autopsy material to date by merging the path ##ological material from two regions involved in the 2003 worldwide sar ##s outbreak in hong kong , china , and toronto , canada . we developed a mono ##cl ##onal antibody against the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein and used it together with in situ hybrid ##ization ( is ##h ) to analyze the autopsy lung tissues of 32 patients with sar ##s from hong kong and toronto . we compared the results of these ass ##ays with the pulmonary path ##ologies and the clinical course of illness for each patient . sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein and rna were detected by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry and is ##h , respectively , primarily in al ##ve ##olar p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and , less frequently , in macro ##pha ##ges . such local ##ization was detected in four of the seven patients who died within two weeks of illness onset , and in none of the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after sy ##mpt ##om onset . conclusions : the pulmonary al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##eli ##um is the chief target of sar ##s - co ##v , with macro ##pha ##ges infected subsequently . viral replication appears to be limited to the first two weeks after sy ##mpt ##om onset , with little evidence of continued widespread replication after this period . if anti ##vira ##l therapy is considered for future treatment , it should be focused on this two - week period of acute clinical disease .  
background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 and 2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption . adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutic ##s . we report the first findings of me ##asurable clinical disease in non ##hum ##an primate ##s ( nh ##ps ) infected with sar ##s - co ##v . methods and findings : in order to character ##ize clinical ##ly relevant parameters of sar ##s - co ##v infection in nh ##ps , we infected cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues with sar ##s - co ##v in three groups : group i was infected in the na ##res and bro ##nch ##us , group ii in the na ##res and con ##jun ##ct ##iva , and group iii intra ##ven ##ously . non ##hum ##an primate ##s in groups i and ii developed mild to moderate sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic illness . all nh ##ps demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutral ##izing antibodies . chest radio ##graphs from several animals in groups i and ii revealed un ##if ##oca ##l or multi ##fo ##cal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 post ##in ##fect ##ion . clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed . overall , in ##oc ##ulation by a mu ##cos ##al route produced more prominent disease than did intra ##ven ##ous in ##oc ##ulation . half of the group i animals were infected with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt infectious clone sar ##s - co ##v derived from the sar ##s - co ##v urban ##i strain . this infectious clone produced disease ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le from wild - type urban ##i strain . conclusions : sar ##s - co ##v infection of cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues did not reproduce the severe illness seen in the majority of adult human cases of sar ##s ; however , our results suggest similarities to the mild ##er syndrome of sar ##s - co ##v infection characteristic ##ally seen in young children .  
background : sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome . sar ##s - co ##v mainly in ##fect ##s tissues of non - l ##ym ##pha ##tic origin , and the cy ##tok ##ine profile of those cells can determine the course of disease . here , we investigated the cy ##tok ##ine response of two human non - l ##ym ##pha ##tic cell lines , ca ##co - 2 and he ##k 293 , which are fully per ##missive for sar ##s - co ##v . results : a comparison with established cy ##tok ##ine - inducing viruses revealed that sar ##s - co ##v only weakly triggered a cy ##tok ##ine response . in particular , sar ##s - co ##v did not activate significant transcription of the inter ##fer ##ons if ##n - α , if ##n - β , if ##n - λ ##1 , if ##n - λ ##2 / 3 , as well as of the inter ##fer ##on - induced anti ##vira ##l genes is ##g ##56 and mx ##a , the che ##mo ##kin ##e ran ##tes and the inter ##le ##uki ##ne il - 6 . interesting ##ly , however , sar ##s - co ##v strongly induced the che ##mo ##kin ##es ip - 10 and il - 8 in the colon car ##cino ##ma cell line ca ##co - 2 , but not in the embryo ##nic kidney cell line 293 . conclusion : our data indicate that sar ##s - co ##v suppress ##es the anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ine system of non - immune cells to a large extent , thus buying time for dissemination in the host . however , synthesis of ip - 10 and il - 8 , which are established markers for acute - stage sar ##s , escapes the virus - induced si ##len ##cing at least in some cell types . therefore , the progressive in ##filtration of immune cells into the infected lungs observed in sar ##s patients could be due to the production of these che ##mo ##kin ##es by the infected tissue cells .  
background : cy ##tok ##ines play important roles in anti ##vira ##l action . we examined whether poly ##morphism ##s of if ##n - γ , tn ##f - α and il - 10 affect the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . methods : a case - control study was carried out in 47 ##6 chinese sar ##s patients and 44 ##9 healthy controls . we tested the poly ##morphism ##s of if ##n - γ , tn ##f - α and il - 10 for their associations with sar ##s . results : if ##n - γ + 87 ##4 ##a all ##ele was associated with su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s in a dose - dependent manner ( p < 0 . 001 ) . individuals with if ##n - γ + 87 ##4 aa and at gen ##otype had a 5 . 19 - fold ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 2 . 78 - 9 . 68 ) and 2 . 57 - fold ( 95 % ci , 1 . 35 - 4 . 88 ) increased risk of developing sar ##s respectively . the poly ##morphism ##s of il - 10 and tn ##f - α were not associated with sar ##s su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . conclusion : if ##n - γ + 87 ##4 ##a all ##ele was shown to be a risk factor in sar ##s su ##sc ##ept ##ibility .  
background : experimental animal data show that protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection with human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) is feasible . for an effective immune prop ##hyl ##ax ##is in humans , broad coverage of different strains of sar ##s - co ##v and control of potential neutral ##ization escape variants will be required . combinations of virus - neutral ##izing , non ##com ##pet ##ing mab ##s may have these properties . methods and findings : human mab cr ##30 ##14 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and ab ##olis ##h ph ##ary ##nge ##al shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v in infected fe ##rret ##s . we generated in vitro sar ##s - co ##v variants escaping neutral ##ization by cr ##30 ##14 , which all had a single p ##46 ##2 ##l mutation in the g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein spike ( s ) of the escape virus . in vitro experiments confirmed that binding of cr ##30 ##14 to a rec ##om ##bina ##nt s fragment ( amino acid residues 318 – 510 ) harbor ##ing this mutation was abolished . we therefore screened an antibody - ph ##age library derived from blood of a con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patient for antibodies complementary to cr ##30 ##14 . a novel mab , cr ##30 ##22 , was identified that neutral ##ized cr ##30 ##14 escape viruses , did not compete with cr ##30 ##14 for binding to rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##1 fragments , and bound to s ##1 fragments derived from the ci ##vet cat sar ##s - co ##v - like strain s ##z ##3 . no escape variants could be generated with cr ##30 ##22 . the mixture of both mab ##s showed neutral ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v in a syn ##er ##gist ##ic fashion by recognizing different ep ##ito ##pes on the receptor - binding domain . dose reduction indices of 4 . 5 and 20 . 5 were observed for cr ##30 ##14 and cr ##30 ##22 , respectively , at 100 % neutral ##ization . because enhancement of sar ##s - co ##v infection by sub ##ne ##ut ##ral ##izing antibody concentrations is of concern , we show here that anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies do not convert the ab ##ort ##ive infection of primary human macro ##pha ##ges by sar ##s - co ##v into a productive one . conclusions : the combination of two non ##com ##pet ##ing human mab ##s cr ##30 ##14 and cr ##30 ##22 potentially controls immune escape and extends the breadth of protection . at the same time , syn ##ergy between cr ##30 ##14 and cr ##30 ##22 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : host genetic factors may play a role in su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and resistance to sar ##s associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . the study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic poly ##morphism ##s of 2 ' , 5 ' - ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late synth ##eta ##se 1 ( o ##as ##1 ) gene as well as my ##x ##ov ##irus resistance 1 ( mx ##a ) gene and su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s in chinese han population . methods : a hospital - based case - control study was conducted . a collective of 66 sar ##s cases and 64 close contact un ##in ##fect ##ed controls were enrolled in this study . end point real time polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) and pc ##r - based restriction fragment length poly ##morphism ( rf ##lp ) analysis were used to detect the single nuclei ##c poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) in o ##as ##1 and mx ##a genes . information on other factors associated with sar ##s infection was collected using a pre - tested question ##naire . un ##ivar ##iate and multi ##var ##iate log ##istic analyses were conducted . results : one poly ##morphism in the 3 ' - un ##tra ##ns ##lated region ( 3 ' - ut ##r ) of the o ##as ##1 gene was associated with sar ##s infection . compared to aa gen ##otype , ag and g ##g gen ##otype ##s were found associated with a protective effect on sar ##s infection with or ##s ( 95 % ci ) of 0 . 42 ( 0 . 20 ~ 0 . 89 ) and 0 . 30 ( 0 . 09 ~ 0 . 97 ) , respectively . also , a gt gen ##otype at position 88 in the mx ##a gene promoter was associated with increased su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s infection compared to a g ##g gen ##otype ( or = 3 . 06 , 95 % ci : 1 . 25 ~ 7 . 50 ) . the associations of ag gen ##otype in o ##as ##1 and gt gen ##otype in mx ##a remained significant in multi ##var ##iate analyses after adjusting for sar ##s protective measures ( or = 0 . 38 , 95 % ci : 0 . 14 ~ 0 . 98 and or = 3 . 22 , 95 % ci : 1 . 13 ~ 9 . 18 , respectively ) . conclusion : s ##np ##s in the o ##as ##1 3 ' - ut ##r and mx ##a promoter region appear associated with host su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s in chinese han population .  
background : in march of 2003 , an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred in northern vietnam . this outbreak began when a traveler arriving from hong kong sought medical care at a small hospital ( hospital a ) in hanoi , initiating a serious and substantial transmission event within the hospital , and subsequent limited spread within the community . methods : we surveyed hospital a personnel for exposure to the index patient and for symptoms of disease during the outbreak . additionally , serum specimens were collected and ass ##ay ##ed for antibody to sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) antibody and job - specific attack rates were calculated . a nest ##ed case - control analysis was performed to assess risk factors for acquiring sar ##s - co ##v infection . results : one hundred and fifty - three of 193 ( 79 . 3 % ) clinical and non - clinical staff consent ##ed to participate . excluding job categories with < 3 workers , the highest sar ##s attack rates occurred among nurses who worked in the out ##patient and in ##patient general wards ( 57 . 1 , 47 . 4 % , respectively ) . nurses assigned to the operating room / intensive care unit , experienced the lowest attack rates ( 7 . 1 % ) among all clinical staff . ser ##olo ##gic evidence of sar ##s - co ##v infection was detected in 4 individuals , including 2 non - clinical workers , who had not previously been identified as sar ##s cases ; none reported having had fever or cough . entering the index patient ' s room and having seen ( viewed ) the patient were the behaviors associated with highest risk for infection by un ##ivar ##iate analysis ( odds ratios 20 . 0 , 14 . 0 ; 95 % confidence intervals 4 . 1 – 97 . 1 , 3 . 6 – 55 . 3 , respectively ) . conclusion : this study highlights job categories and activities associated with increased risk for sar ##s - co ##v infection and demonstrates that a broad diversity of hospital workers may be vulnerable during an outbreak . these findings may help guide recommendations for the protection of vulnerable occupational groups and may have implications for other respiratory infections such as influenza .  
background : the sar ##s outbreak of 2002 – 2003 presented clinic ##ians with a new , life - threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options . the world health organization ( who ) expert panel on sar ##s treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for sar ##s - infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research . methods and findings : in response to the who request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on rib ##avi ##rin , co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , lo ##pina ##vir and ri ##ton ##avi ##r ( lp ##v / r ) , type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( iv ##ig ) , and sar ##s con ##vale ##scent plasma from both in vitro studies and in sar ##s patients . we also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome . sources of data were the literature databases med ##line , em ##base , bio ##sis , and the cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) up to february 2005 . data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using pre ##de ##fine ##d criteria . in total , 54 sar ##s treatment studies , 15 in vitro studies , and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria . within in vitro studies , rib ##avi ##rin , lo ##pina ##vir , and type i if ##n showed inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v in tissue culture . in sar ##s - infected patient reports on rib ##avi ##rin , 26 studies were classified as inc ##on ##clusive , and four showed possible harm . seven studies of con ##vale ##scent plasma or iv ##ig , three of if ##n type i , and two of lp ##v / r were inc ##on ##clusive . in 29 studies of ste ##roid use , 25 were inc ##on ##clusive and four were classified as causing possible harm . conclusions : despite an extensive literature reporting on sar ##s treatments , it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the sar ##s outbreak . some may have been harmful . clinical trials should be designed to valid ##ate a standard protocol for dos ##age and timing , and to acc ##ru ##e data in real time during future outbreak ##s to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment .  
background : it is believed that animal - to - human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is the cause of the sar ##s outbreak worldwide . the spike ( s ) protein is one of the best characterized proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , which plays a key role in sar ##s - co ##v overcoming species barrier and accomplish ##ing inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission from animals to humans , suggesting that it may be the major target of selective pressure . however , the process of adaptive evolution of s protein and the exact positively selected sites associated with this process remain unknown . results : by investigating the adaptive evolution of s protein , we identified twelve amino acid sites ( 75 , 239 , 244 , 311 , 47 ##9 , 60 ##9 , 61 ##3 , 74 ##3 , 76 ##5 , 77 ##8 , 114 ##8 , and 116 ##3 ) in the s protein under positive selective pressure . based on phylogenetic tree and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigation , sar ##s outbreak was divided into three epidemic groups : 02 – 04 inter ##sp ##ec ##ies , 03 - early - mid , and 03 - late epidemic groups in the present study . positive selection was detected in the first two groups , which represent the course of sar ##s - co ##v inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission and of viral adaptation to human host , respectively . in contrast , pu ##ri ##fying selection was detected in 03 - late group . these indicate that s protein experiences variable positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization . a total of 25 sites in 02 – 04 inter ##sp ##ec ##ies epidemic group and 16 sites in 03 - early - mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection . the identified sites were different between these two groups except for site 239 , which suggests that positively selected sites are change ##able between groups . moreover , it was showed that a larger proportion ( 24 % ) of positively selected sites was located in receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) than in he ##pta ##d repeat ( hr ) 1 - hr ##2 region in 02 – 04 inter ##sp ##ec ##ies epidemic group ( p = 0 . 02 ##0 ##8 ) , and a greater percentage ( 25 % ) of these sites occurred in hr ##1 – hr ##2 region than in rb ##d in 03 - early - mid epidemic group ( p = 0 . 07 ##21 ) . these suggest that functional ##ly different domains of s protein may not experience same positive selection in each epidemic group . in addition , three specific replacements ( f ##36 ##0s , t ##48 ##7 ##s and l ##66 ##5 ##s ) were only found between 03 - human sar ##s - co ##vs and strains from 02 – 04 inter ##sp
background : in 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome , a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death . sar ##s - co ##v is a zoo ##not ##ic virus that crossed the species barrier , most likely originating from bats or from other species including ci ##vet ##s , ra ##cco ##on dogs , domestic cats , sw ##ine , and rodents . a sar ##s - co ##v vaccine should con ##fer long - term protection , especially in vulnerable sen ##es ##cent populations , against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoo ##not ##ic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs . we report the comprehensive investigation of sar ##s vaccine efficacy in young and sen ##es ##cent mice following homo ##log ##ous and het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge . methods and findings : using venezuelan e ##quin ##e en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus rep ##lic ##on particles ( vr ##p ) expressing the 2003 epidemic urban ##i sar ##s - co ##v strain spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( vr ##p - s ) or the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein from the same strain ( vr ##p - n ) , we demonstrate that vr ##p - s , but not vr ##p - n vaccines provide complete short - and long - term protection against homo ##log ##ous strain challenge in young and sen ##es ##cent mice . to test vr ##p vaccine efficacy against a het ##ero ##log ##ous sar ##s - co ##v , we used phylogenetic analyses , synthetic biology , and reverse genetics to construct a chi ##meric virus ( ic ##g ##do ##3 - s ) encoding a synthetic s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gene of the most genetically diver ##gent human strain , g ##do ##3 , which clusters among the zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v . ic ##g ##d ##0 ##3 - s replicate ##d efficiently in human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells and in the lungs of young and sen ##es ##cent mice , and was highly resistant to neutral ##ization with anti ##ser ##a directed against the urban ##i strain . although vr ##p - s vaccines provided complete short - term protection against het ##ero ##log ##ous ic ##g ##d ##0 ##3 - s challenge in young mice , only limited protection was seen in va ##cci ##nated sen ##es ##cent animals . vr ##p - n vaccines not only failed to protect from homo ##log ##ous or het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge , but resulted in enhanced im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology with e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic infiltrate ##s within the lungs of sar ##s - co ##v – challenged mice . vr ##p - n – induced pathology presented at day 4 , peaked around day 7 , and persisted through day
most of the individuals infected with sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention . however , the im ##mun ##ological co ##rre ##lates associated with patients ' recovery are currently unknown . in this report , we have sequential ##ly monitored 30 recovered patients over a two - year period to character ##ize temporal changes in sar ##s - co ##v - specific antibody responses as well as cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t cell ( ct ##l ) responses . we have found persistence of robust antibody and ct ##l responses in all of the study subjects throughout the study period , with a moderate decline one year after the onset of symptoms . we have also identified two potential major ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes in n proteins based on eli ##sp ##ot analysis of poole ##d peptide ##s . however , despite the potent immune responses and clinical recovery , peripheral l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts in the recovered patients have not yet been restored to normal levels . in summary , our study has , for the first time , characterized the temporal and dynamic changes of humor ##al and ct ##l responses in the natural history of sar ##s - recovered individuals , and strongly supports the notion that high and sustainable levels of immune responses co ##rre ##late strongly with the disease outcome . our findings have direct implications for future design and development of effective therapeutic agents and vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
no single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) reproduce ##s all aspects of the human disease . young in ##bre ##d mice support sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation . they are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible , but their use in sar ##s research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection . older ( 12 - to 14 - mo - old ) bal ##b / c mice develop clinical illness and p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis , but they can be hard to pro ##cure , and immune sen ##escence com ##pl ##icate ##s pathogen ##esis studies . we adapted the sar ##s - co ##v ( urban ##i strain ) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young bal ##b / c mice . fifteen passages resulted in a virus ( ma ##15 ) that is lethal for mice following intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation . lethal ##ity is preceded by rapid and high ti ##ter viral replication in lungs , vi ##rem ##ia , and dissemination of virus to extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry sites accompanied by l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia , and path ##ological changes in the lungs . abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells and al ##ve ##olar p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , and nec ##rot ##ic cellular debris is present in airways and al ##ve ##oli , with only mild and focal p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis . these observations suggest that mice infected with ma ##15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive , viral ##ly mediated destruction of p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and ci ##lia ##ted ep ##ith ##elial cells . the ma ##15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased vi ##ru ##lence ; when introduced into a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v , these mutations result in a highly vi ##ru ##lent and lethal virus ( rm ##a1 ##5 ) , du ##pl ##ica ##ting the ph ##eno ##type of the biological ##ly derived ma ##15 virus . intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation with ma ##15 reproduce ##s many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of sar ##s . the availability of the ma ##15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for sar ##s because infection with ma ##15 causes mor ##bid ##ity , mortality , and pulmonary pathology . this virus will be of value as a string ##ent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls .  
both viral effect and immune - mediated mechanism are involved in the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . in this study , we showed that in sar ##s patient sera there were auto ##ant ##ib ##odies ( auto ##ab ##s ) that reacted with a ##54 ##9 cells , the type - 2 p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , and that these auto ##ab ##s were mainly i ##gg . the auto ##ab ##s were detect ##able 20 days after fever onset . tests of non - sar ##s - pneumonia patients did not show the same auto ##ab production as in sar ##s patients . after sera i ##gg bound to a ##54 ##9 cells , cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city was induced . cell cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city and the anti - ep ##ith ##elial cell i ##gg level were positively correlated . pre ##ab ##sor ##ption and binding ass ##ays indicated the existence of cross - reactive ep ##ito ##pes on sar ##s - co ##v spike protein domain 2 ( s ##2 ) . furthermore , treatment of a ##54 ##9 cells with anti - s ##2 abs and if ##n - γ resulted in an increase in the adherence of human peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells to these ep ##ith ##elial cells . taken together , we have demonstrated that the anti - s ##2 abs in sar ##s patient sera cause cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c injury as well as enhance immune cell ad ##hesion to ep ##ith ##elial cells . the onset of auto ##im ##mun ##e responses in sar ##s - co ##v infection may be implicated in sar ##s pathogen ##esis .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused a large outbreak of pneumonia in beijing , china , in 2003 . reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) was used to detect and quan ##tify sar ##s - co ##v in 93 ##4 sera and self - collected throat wash ##es and fe ##cal samples from 271 patients with laboratory - confirmed sar ##s managed at a single institution . results : sar ##s - co ##v detection rates in sera were highest in the first 9 days of illness , whereas detection was highest in throat wash ##es 5 – 14 days after onset of symptoms . the highest sar ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r rates ( 70 . 4 – 86 . 3 % ) and viral loads ( log ( 10 ) 4 . 5 – 6 . 1 ) were seen in fe ##cal samples collected 2 – 4 weeks after the onset of clinical illness . fe ##cal samples were frequently sar ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r positive beyond 40 days , and occasional sera still had sar ##s - co ##v detected after 3 weeks of illness . conclusion : in the context of an extensive outbreak with major pressure on hospital resources , patient self - collected samples are an alternative to nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates for laboratory confirmation of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : extraordinary infection control measures limited access to medical care in the greater toronto area during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak . the objective of this study was to determine if the period of these infection control measures was associated with changes in overall population mortality due to causes other than sar ##s . methods : observation ##al study of death registry data , using po ##isson regression and interrupted time - series analysis to examine all - cause mortality rates ( excluding deaths due to sar ##s ) before , during , and after the sar ##s outbreak . the population of ontario was grouped into the greater toronto area ( n = 2 . 9 million ) and the rest of ontario ( n = 9 . 3 million ) based upon the level of restrictions on delivery of clinical services during the sar ##s outbreak . results : there was no significant change in mortality in the greater toronto area before , during , and after the period of the sar ##s outbreak in 2003 compared to the corresponding time periods in 2002 and 2001 . the rate ratio for all - cause mortality during the sar ##s outbreak was 0 . 99 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 0 . 93 – 1 . 06 ] compared to 2002 and 0 . 96 [ 95 % ci 0 . 90 – 1 . 03 ] compared to 2001 . an interrupted time series analysis found no significant change in mortality rates in the greater toronto area associated with the period of the sar ##s outbreak . conclusion : limitations on access to medical services during the 2003 sar ##s outbreak in toronto had no ob ##ser ##vable impact on short - term population mortality . effects on mor ##bid ##ity and long - term mortality were not assessed . efforts to contain future infectious disease outbreak ##s due to influenza or other agents must consider effects on access to essential health care services .  
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is likely mediated by di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ional immune responses and the ability of the virus to ci ##rc ##um ##vent innate immunity . using functional gen ##omics , we analyzed early host responses to sar ##s - co ##v infection in the lungs of adolescent cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca fa ##sc ##icular ##is ) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with sar ##s . analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e genes , including inter ##le ##uki ##n ( il ) - 6 , il - 8 , and ip - 10 , which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome . as opposed to many in vitro experiments , sar ##s - co ##v induced a wide range of type i inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) and nuclear trans ##lo ##cation of ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated signal trans ##du ##cer and act ##iva ##tor of transcription 1 in the lungs of mac ##aq ##ues . using im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry , we revealed that these anti ##vira ##l signaling pathways were differential ##ly regulated in distinctive subset ##s of cells . our studies emphasize that the induction of early if ##n signaling may be critical to con ##fer protection against sar ##s - co ##v infection and highlight the strength of combining functional gen ##omics with im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry to further un ##rave ##l the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
the 34 k ##da main protein ##ase ( m ( pro ) ) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays an important role in the virus life cycle through the specific processing of viral poly ##pro ##tein ##s . as such , sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) is a key target for the identification of specific inhibitors directed against the sar ##s virus . with a view to facilitating the development of such compounds , crystals were obtained of the enzyme at ph 6 . 5 in the or ##thor ##hom ##bic space group p ##2 ( 1 ) 2 ( 1 ) 2 that di ##ff ##rac ##t to a resolution of 1 . 9 a . these crystals contain one mono ##mer per as ##ym ##metric unit and the biological ##ly active dime ##r is generated via the crystal ##log ##raphic two ##fold axis . the conform ##ation of the catalytic site indicates that the enzyme is active in the crystalline form and thus suitable for structure - based inhibition studies .  
the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike is the largest known viral spike molecule , and shares a similar function with all class 1 viral fusion proteins . previous structural studies of membrane fusion proteins have largely used crystal ##log ##raphy of static molecular fragments , in isolation of their trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains . in this study we have produced pu ##rified , ir ##rad ##iated sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s that retain their morphology , and are fu ##so ##genic in cell culture . we used cry ##o - electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conform ##ation ##al changes that occur in the entire spike of intact vi ##rion ##s when they bind to the viral receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . we have shown that ace ##2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion , and precisely localized the receptor - binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike . furthermore , our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps , and that each spike can bind up to three ace ##2 molecules . the sar ##s - co ##v spike provides an ideal model system to study receptor binding and membrane fusion in the native state , employing cry ##o - electron microscopy and single - particle image analysis .  
identification of the nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - infected cells is crucial toward understanding the pathogen ##esis . using multi ##color col ##oca ##lization techniques , we previously reported that sar ##s ( + ) cells in the lung of fatally infected patients expressed the only known functional receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , and also a binding receptor , liver / l ##ym ##ph node – specific ic ##am - 3 – grabbing non - int ##eg ##rin ( cd ##20 ##9 ##l ) . in this study , we show that sar ##s - infected cells also express the stem / pro ##gen ##itor cell markers cd ##34 and oct - 4 , and do not express cy ##tok ##era ##tin or surf ##act ##ant . these put ##ative lung stem / pro ##gen ##itor cells can also be identified in some non - sar ##s individuals and can be infected by sar ##s - corona ##virus ex vivo . infection of these cells may contribute to the loss of lung repair capacity that leads to respiratory failure as clinical ##ly observed .  
after > 8 , 000 infections and > 700 deaths worldwide , the pathogen ##esis of the new infectious disease , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , remains poorly understood . we investigated 18 auto ##ps ##ies of patients who had suspected sar ##s ; 8 cases were confirmed as sar ##s . we evaluated white blood cells from 22 confirmed sar ##s patients at various stages of the disease . t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts in 65 confirmed and 35 mis ##dia ##gno ##sed sar ##s cases also were analyzed retrospective ##ly . sar ##s viral particles and gen ##omic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , mono ##cytes , and l ##ym ##ph ##oid tissues , as well as in the ep ##ith ##elial cells of the respiratory tract , the mu ##cos ##a of the int ##est ##ine , the ep ##ith ##eli ##um of the renal distal tub ##ules , the neurons of the brain , and macro ##pha ##ges in different organs . sar ##s virus seemed to be capable of in ##fect ##ing multiple cell types in several organs ; immune cells and pulmonary ep ##ith ##eli ##um were identified as the main sites of injury . a comprehensive theory of pathogen ##esis is proposed for sar ##s with immune and lung damage as key features .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) media ##tes extensive pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s , and is considered a promising target for anti - sar ##s drug development . here we present a rapid and high - through ##put screening method to study the substrate specific ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . six target amino acid positions flanking the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) cleavage site were investigated . each batch of mixed peptide substrates with defined amino acid substitution ##s at the target amino acid position was synthesized via the “ cartridge replacement ” approach and was subjected to en ##zy ##matic cleavage by rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of each peptide substrate to sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) cleavage was monitored simultaneously by matrix - assisted laser des ##or ##ption / ion ##ization time - of - flight mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ( mal ##di - to ##f ms ) . the hydro ##phobic pocket in the p ##2 position at the pro ##tea ##se cleavage site is crucial to sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) - specific binding , which is limited to substitution by hydro ##phobic residue . the binding interface of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) that is facing the p ##1 ′ position is suggested to be occupied by acidic amino acids , thus the p ##1 ′ position is into ##ler ##ant to acidic residue substitution , owing to electro ##static rep ##ulsion . ste ##ric hind ##rance caused by some bulky or β - branching amino acids in p ##3 and p ##2 ′ positions may also hind ##er the binding of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . this study generates a comprehensive overview of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) substrate specific ##ity , which serves as the design basis of synthetic peptide - based sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibitors . our experimental approach is believed to be widely applicable for investigating the substrate specific ##ity of other pro ##tea ##ses in a rapid and high - through ##put manner that is compatible for future automated analysis .  
molecular mimic ##ry , defined as similar structures shared by molecules from di ##ssi ##mi ##lar genes or proteins , is a general strategy used by pathogen ##s to in ##fect host cells . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new human respiratory infectious disease caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v plays an important role in the virus entry into a cell . in this study , eleven synthetic peptide ##s from the s protein were selected based on its sequence homo ##logy with human proteins . two of the peptide ##s d ##0 ##7 ( residues 92 ##7 – 93 ##7 ) and d ##0 ##8 ( residues 94 ##2 – 95 ##1 ) were recognized by the sera of sar ##s patients . mu ##rine hyper ##im ##mun ##e sera against these peptide ##s bound to proteins of human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells a ##54 ##9 . another peptide d ##10 ( residues 490 – 50 ##2 ) stimulated a ##54 ##9 to pro ##life ##rate and secret ##e il - 8 . the present results suggest that the selected s protein regions , which share sequence homo ##logy with human proteins , may play important roles in sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) represent a promising vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) . in this study , rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus va ##cs and va ##cm ##e were constructed to express the s protein and the m and e proteins of sar ##s co ##v , respectively . electron microscope analysis demonstrated the formation of v ##lp ##s in va ##cm ##e and va ##cs coin ##fect ##ed insect cells . mice im ##mun ##ized four times with v ##lp ##s developed high antibody ti ##tres against sar ##s co ##v . in addition , v ##lp ##s eli ##cite ##d cell - mediated immunity as demonstrated by enhanced inter ##fer ##on - γ and inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 production . v ##lp ##s also conferred protective immunity against the infection of spike protein pseudo ##type ##d mu ##rine le ##uka ##emia virus . our findings demonstrate that sar ##s co ##v v ##lp ##s are im ##mun ##ogenic and can eli ##cit strong sar ##s co ##v - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses in mice . this is the first study describing the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of sar ##s co ##v v ##lp ##s , providing valuable data for developing a protective vaccine against sar ##s co ##v infection .  
the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) remains poorly understood . in the current study , two rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus were generated to express the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ( sl - co ##v ) isolated from bats ( va ##cb ##s ) and the envelope ( e ) and membrane ( m ) proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , respectively . co - infection of insect cells with these two rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus ##es led to self - assembly of virus - like particles ( b ##v ##lp ##s ) as demonstrated by electron microscopy . incorporation of s protein of va ##cb ##s ( bs ) into v ##lp ##s was confirmed by western b ##lot and im ##mun ##ogo ##ld labeling . such b ##v ##lp ##s up - regulated the level of cd ##40 , cd ##80 , cd ##86 , cd ##8 ##3 , and enhanced the secret ##ion of il - 6 , il - 10 and tn ##f - α in immature den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) . immune responses were compared in immature dc ##s in ##oc ##ulated with b ##v ##lp ##s or with v ##lp ##s formed by s , e and m proteins of human sar ##s - co ##v . b ##v ##lp ##s showed a stronger ability to stimulate dc ##s in terms of cy ##tok ##ine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of il - 6 and tn ##f - α . further study indicated that if ##n - γ + and il - 4 + populations in cd ##4 + t cells increased upon co - cultivation with dc ##s pre - exposed with b ##v ##lp ##s or sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s . the observed difference in dc - stimulating activity between b ##v ##lp ##s and sar ##s co ##v v ##lp ##s was very likely due to the s protein . in agreement , sl - co ##v s dna vaccine ev ##oked a more vigorous antibody response and a stronger t cell response than sar ##s - co ##v s dna in mice . our data have demonstrated for the first time that sl - co ##v v ##lp ##s formed by membrane proteins of different origins , one from sl - co ##v isolated from bats ( bs ) and the other two from human sar ##s - co ##v ( e and m ) , activated immature dc ##s and enhanced the expression of co - st ##im ##ulator ##y molecules and the secret ##ion of cy ##tok ##ines . finding in this study may provide important information for vaccine development as well as for understanding the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - like co ##v .  
using a comprehensive set of discovery and optimization tools , antibodies were produced with the ability to neutral ##ize sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection in ve ##ro e ##6 cells and in animal models . these anti - sar ##s antibodies were discovered using a novel dna display method , which can identify new antibodies within days . once neutral ##izing antibodies were identified , a comprehensive and effective means of converting the mouse sequences to human framework ##s was accomplished using hu ##fr ##™ ( human framework re ##asse ##mb ##ly ) technology . the best variant ( 61 ##g ##4 ) from this screen showed a 3 . 5 – 4 - fold improvement in neutral ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . finally , using a complete site - sat ##uration mu ##tage ##nes ##is methodology focused on the cd ##r ( complement ##ari ##ty determining regions ) , a single point mutation ( 51 ##e ##7 ) was identified that improved the 80 % plaque reduction neutral ##ization of the virus by greater than 8 - fold . these discovery and evolution strategies can be applied to any emerging pathogen or toxin where a ca ##usa ##tive agent is known .  
phylogenetic analyses have provided strong evidence that amino acid changes in spike ( s ) protein of animal and human sar ##s corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##vs ) during and between two zoo ##not ##ic transfers ( 2002 / 03 and 2003 / 04 ) are the result of positive selection . while several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter - species adaptation , the role of neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) in driving sar ##s - co ##v evolution , particularly during intra - species transmission , is unknown . a detailed examination of sar ##s - co ##v infected animal and human con ##vale ##scent sera could provide evidence of na ##b pressure which , if found , may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broad ##ening the activity of na ##bs . here we show , by focusing on a dominant neutral ##ization ep ##ito ##pe , that con ##tem ##por ##aneous - and cross - strain na ##b responses against sar ##s - co ##v spike protein exist during natural infection . in vitro immune pressure on this ep ##ito ##pe using 2002 / 03 strain - specific na ##b 80 ##r rec ##ap ##it ##ulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003 / 04 animal and human viruses . strategies to block this na ##b escape / naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad na ##bs ( bn ##ab ##s ) with activity against 80 ##r escape mutants and both 2002 / 03 and 2003 / 04 strains were explored . structure - based amino acid changes in an activation - induced cy ##ti ##dine dea ##mina ##se ( aid ) “ hot spot ” in a light chain cd ##r ( complement ##ari ##ty determining region ) alone , introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non - immune human v ##l chain repertoire or by targeted mu ##tage ##nes ##is , were successful in generating these bn ##ab ##s . these results demonstrate that na ##b - mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra - species transmission of sar ##s - co ##v . so ##matic hyper ##mut ##ation ( sh ##m ) of a single v ##l cd ##r can markedly broad ##en the activity of a strain - specific na ##b . the strategies investigated in this study , in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain - shuffling as well as hot - spot cd ##r mu ##tage ##nes ##is , can be exploited to broad ##en neutral ##ization activity , to improve anti - viral na ##b the ##ra ##pies , and directly manipulate virus evolution .  
corona ##virus ##es comprise a large group of rna viruses with diverse host specific ##ity . the emergence of highly pathogen ##ic strains like the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and the discovery of two new corona ##virus ##es , nl - 63 and hk ##u ##1 , co ##rro ##bor ##ates the high rate of mutation and rec ##om ##bina ##tion that have enabled them to cross species barriers and in ##fect novel hosts . for that reason , the development of broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##ls that are effective against several members of this family is highly desirable . this goal can be accomplished by designing inhibitors against a target , such as the main pro ##tea ##se 3 ##cl ( pro ) ( m ( pro ) ) , which is highly conserved among all corona ##virus ##es . here 3 ##cl ( pro ) derived from the sar ##s - co ##v was used as the primary target to identify a new class of inhibitors containing a halo ##met ##hyl ke ##tone war ##head . the compounds are highly potent against sar ##s 3 ##cl ( pro ) with k ( i ) ' s as low as 300 nm . the crystal structure of the complex of one of the compounds with 3 ##cl ( pro ) indicates that this inhibitor forms a th ##io ##eth ##er link ##age between the halo ##met ##hyl carbon of the war ##head and the catalytic cy ##s 145 . furthermore , structure activity relationship ( sar ) studies of these compounds have led to the identification of a ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore that accurately defines the essential molecular features required for the high affinity .  
background : despite the use of a series of prevent ##ive measures , a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was observed among health care workers ( hc ##ws ) during the sar ##s epidemic . this study aimed to determine which prevent ##ive measures may have been effective in protecting hc ##ws from infection , and which were not effective . methods : a retrospective study was performed among 75 ##8 ' front ##line ' health care workers who cared for sar ##s patients at the second affiliated hospital and the third affiliated hospital of sun ya ##t - sen university . the hc ##ws with i ##gg against sar ##s and those without i ##gg against sar ##s were respectively defined as the case group and the control group , and log ##istic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for sar ##s infection in hc ##ws . results : after adjusting for age , gender , marital status , educational level , professional title , and the department in which an individual worked , the results of a multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression analysis indicated that incidence of sar ##s among hc ##ws was significantly and positively associated with : performing tr ##ache ##al int ##uba ##tions for sar ##s patients , methods used for air ventilation in wards , avoiding face - to - face interaction with sar ##s patients , the number of pairs of gloves worn by hc ##ws , and caring for serious sar ##s cases . conclusion : some measures , particularly good air ventilation in sar ##s wards , may be effective in mini ##mi ##zing or preventing sar ##s transmission among hc ##ws in hospitals .  
since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 , the three - dimensional structures of several of the replica ##se / transcript ##ase components of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , the non - structural proteins ( ns ##ps ) , have been determined . however , within the large ns ##p ##3 ( 1922 amino - acid residues ) , the structure and function of the so - called sar ##s - unique domain ( sud ) have remained elusive . sud occurs only in sar ##s - co ##v and the highly related viruses found in certain bats , but is absent from all other corona ##virus ##es . therefore , it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v , compared to other corona ##virus ##es , most of which cause only mild infections in humans . in order to help el ##uc ##ida ##te the function of the sud , we have determined crystal structures of fragment 38 ##9 – 65 ##2 ( “ sud ( core ) ” ) of ns ##p ##3 , which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain . both the mono ##cl ##ini ##c and tri ##cl ##ini ##c crystal forms ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 8 a resolution , respectively ) revealed that sud ( core ) forms a homo ##dim ##er . each mono ##mer consists of two sub ##dom ##ains , sud - n and sud - m , with a macro ##dom ##ain fold similar to the sar ##s - co ##v x - domain . however , in contrast to the latter , sud fails to bind ad ##p - rib ##ose , as determined by zone - interference gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is . instead , the entire sud ( core ) as well as its individual sub ##dom ##ains interact with ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide ##s known to form g - quad ##rup ##le ##xes . this includes ol ##igo ##de ##ox ##y - as well as ol ##igo ##ri ##bon ##uc ##le ##otide ##s . mutations of selected l ##ys ##ine residues on the surface of the sud - n sub ##dom ##ain lead to reduction of g - quad ##rup ##le ##x binding , whereas mutations in the sud - m sub ##dom ##ain ab ##olis ##h it . as there is no evidence for ns ##p ##3 entering the nucleus of the host cell , the sar ##s - co ##v gen ##omic rna or host - cell mrna containing long g - stretches may be targets of sud . the sar ##s - co ##v genome is devoid of g - stretches longer than 5 – 6 nu ##cle ##otide ##s , but more extended g - stretches are found in the 3 ′ - non ##tra ##ns ##lated regions of mrna ##s coding for certain host - cell proteins involved
background : sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s , and extensive investigations indicated that it originated from an animal source ( probably bats ) and was recently introduced into the human population via wildlife animals from wet markets in southern china . previous studies revealed that the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s had experienced adaptive evolution , but whether other functional proteins of sar ##s have undergone adaptive evolution is not known . results : we employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different sar ##s - co ##v groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts . our results suggest that most functional proteins of sar ##s - co ##v have experienced a step ##wise adaptive evolutionary pathway . similar to previous studies , the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases , and became stabilized in the late phase . in addition , the replica ##se experienced positive selection only in human patients , whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases . no positive selection was found in any proteins of bat sar ##s - like - co ##v . furthermore , specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified . conclusion : this extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the step ##wise evolution of different functional proteins of sar ##s - co ##vs at different epidemic stages and different hosts . these results support the hypothesis that sar ##s - co ##v originated from bats and that the spill over into ci ##vet ##s and humans were more recent events .  
background : the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory disease syndrome ( sar ##s ) is not fully understood . one case - control study has reported an association between su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s and mann ##an - binding le ##ct ##in ( mb ##l ) in china . as the downstream protein of mb ##l , variants of the mb ##l - associated ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se - 2 ( mas ##p ##2 ) gene may be associated with sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection in the same population . methods : thirty individuals with sar ##s were chosen for analysis of mas ##p ##2 poly ##morphism ##s by means of pc ##r direct sequencing . tag single nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( tags ##np ##s ) were chosen using pair ##wise tag ##ging algorithms . the frequencies of four tag s ##np ##s ( rs ##12 ##7 ##11 ##52 ##1 , rs ##22 ##6 ##16 ##9 ##5 , rs ##22 ##7 ##33 ##46 and rs ##75 ##48 ##65 ##9 ) were as ##cer ##tained in 37 ##6 sar ##s patients and 52 ##3 control subjects , using the beck ##man s ##np ##stream ultra high through ##put gen ##ot ##yp ##ing platform . results : there is no significant association between all ##eles or gen ##otype ##s of the mas ##p ##2 tags ##np and su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v in both beijing and guangzhou populations . dip ##lot ##ype ( rs ##22 ##7 ##33 ##46 and rs ##12 ##7 ##11 ##52 ##1 ) were analyzed for association with su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s , no statistical ##ly significant evidence of association was observed . the beijing and guangzhou sample groups were homogeneous regarding demographic and genetic parameters , a joined analysis also showed no statistical ##ly significant evidence of association . conclusion : our data do not suggest a role for mas ##p ##2 poly ##morphism ##s in sar ##s su ##sc ##ept ##ibility in northern and southern china .  
background : the sar ##s outbreak in 2003 provides a unique opportunity for the study of human responses to a novel virus . we have previously reported that den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for sar ##s - co ##v . in this study , we focus ##sed on the gene expression of toll - like receptors ( t ##lr ##s ) , che ##mo ##kin ##e receptors ( cc ##rs ) and death receptor ligand ##s in sar ##s - co ##v infected dc ##s . we also compared adult and cord blood ( cb ) dc ##s to find a possible explanation for the age - dependent severity of sar ##s . results : our results demonstrates that sar ##s - co ##v did not mod ##ulate t ##lr - 1 to t ##lr - 10 gene expression but significantly induced the expression of cc ##r - 1 , cc ##r - 3 , and cc ##r - 5 . there was also strong induction of tn ##f - related ap ##op ##tosis - inducing ligand ( trail ) , but not fa ##s ligand gene expression in sar ##s - co ##v infected dc ##s . interesting ##ly , the expressions of most genes studied were higher in cb dc ##s than adult dc ##s . conclusion : the up ##re ##gul ##ation of che ##mo ##kin ##es and cc ##rs may facilitate dc migration from the infection site to the l ##ym ##ph nodes , whereas the increase of trail may induce l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ap ##op ##tosis . these findings may explain the increased lung in ##filtration ##s and l ##ym ##ph ##oid de ##ple ##tion in sar ##s patients . further exploration ##s of the biological significance of these findings are warrant ##ed .  
the g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted membrane protein m of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the main structural component of the vi ##rion and media ##tes assembly and bud ##ding of viral particles . the membrane topology of sar ##s - co ##v m and the functional significance of its n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion are not completely understood as is its interaction with the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein s . using bio ##chemical and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence analyses we found that m consists of a short g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted n - terminal ec ##to ##dom ##ain , three trans ##me ##mb ##rane segments and a long , im ##mun ##ogenic c - terminal end ##od ##oma ##in . although the n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site of m seems to be highly conserved between group 1 and 3 corona ##virus ##es , studies using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v expressing a g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion - def ##icient m revealed that n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of m neither influence the shape of the vi ##rion ##s nor their in ##fect ##ivity in cell culture . further functional analysis of truncated m proteins showed that the n - terminal 134 amino acids comprising the three trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains are sufficient to media ##te accumulation of m in the go ##l ##gi complex and to enforce recruitment of the viral spike protein s to the sites of virus assembly and bud ##ding in the er ##gic .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is composed of two subunit ##s ; the s ##1 subunit contains a receptor - binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 and the s ##2 subunit media ##tes fusion between the viral and host cell membranes . the s protein plays key parts in the induction of neutral ##izing - antibody and t - cell responses , as well as protective immunity , during infection with sar ##s - co ##v . in this review , we highlight recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s based on the s protein .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus that cost nearly 800 lives . while there have been no recent outbreak ##s of the disease , the threat remains as sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs . therefore , the development of a vaccine against sar ##s is in grave need . here , we have designed and produced a proto ##typic sar ##s vaccine : a self - ass ##em ##bling poly ##pe ##pt ##ide nano ##par ##tic ##le that repetitive ##ly displays a sar ##s b - cell ep ##ito ##pe from the c - terminal he ##pta ##d repeat of the virus ’ spike protein . bio ##physical analyses with circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm , transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing α - he ##lc ##ial nano ##par ##tic ##les with sizes of about 25 nm . im ##mun ##ization experiments with no ad ##ju ##vant ##s were performed with bal ##b / c mice . an investigation of the binding properties of the eli ##cite ##d antibodies showed that they were highly conform ##ation specific for the coiled - coil ep ##ito ##pe because they specifically recognized the native trim ##eric conform ##ation of c - terminal he ##pta ##d repeat region . consequently , the anti ##ser ##a exhibited neutral ##ization activity in an in vitro infection inhibition ass ##ay . we conclude that these peptide nano ##par ##tic ##les represent a promising platform for vaccine design , in particular for diseases that are characterized by neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes with coiled - coil conform ##ation such as sar ##s - co ##v or other enveloped viruses .  
background : entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires the activation of viral envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s through cleavage by either intra ##cellular or extra ##cellular pro ##tea ##ses . in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of pro ##tea ##se cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry , we investigated the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt native full - length s - protein trim ##er ( tri ##sp ##ike ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) to cleavage by various air ##way pro ##tea ##ses . methodology / principal findings : pu ##rified tri ##sp ##ike proteins were readily cl ##ea ##ved in vitro by three different air ##way pro ##tea ##ses : try ##ps ##in , pl ##as ##min and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##11 ##a . high performance liquid ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy ( hp ##lc ) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two ar ##gin ##ine residues ( r ##66 ##7 and r ##7 ##9 ##7 ) as potential pro ##tea ##se cleavage site ( s ) . the effect of pro ##tea ##se - dependent enhancement of sar ##s - co ##v infection was demonstrated with ace ##2 expressing human bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells 16 ##h ##be . air ##way pro ##tea ##ses regulate the in ##fect ##ivity of sar ##s - co ##v in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding . the role of ar ##gin ##ine residues was further shown with mutant construct ##s ( r ##66 ##7 ##a , r ##7 ##9 ##7 ##a or r ##7 ##9 ##7 ##ar ##66 ##7 ##a ) . mutation of r ##66 ##7 or r ##7 ##9 ##7 did not affect the expression of s - protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudo ##ty ##ping into sar ##s - co ##v ##pp . the r ##66 ##7 ##a sar ##s - co ##v ##pp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following pro ##tea ##se treatment . conclusions / significance : these results suggest that sar ##s s - protein is susceptible to air ##way pro ##tea ##se cleavage and , furthermore , that pro ##tea ##se mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conform ##ation of sar ##s s - protein upon ace ##2 binding . these data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v along the respiratory system and , furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v , is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality . a typical clinical feature associated with sar ##s is pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis and associated lung failure . in the aftermath of the sar ##s epidemic , although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made , a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how sar ##s - co ##v interact ##s with the host cell at the onset of infection . the rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation . we have focused on a novel concept of micro ##rna ( mir ##na ) – mediated host – virus interactions in bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar stem cells ( bas ##cs ) at the onset of infection by co ##rre ##lating the “ bas ##c – micro ##rno ##me ” with their targets within bas ##cs and viral genome . this work encompasses mir ##na array data analysis , target prediction , and mir ##na – mrna enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease - related factors , mir ##nas , and bas ##cs in sar ##s pathway , which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall inter ##play leading to disease progression . our observation reveals the bas ##cs ( sc ##a - 1 + cd ##34 + cd ##45 - pe ##cam - ) , a subset of oct - 4 + ace ##2 + ep ##ith ##elial colony cells at the bro ##nch ##o - al ##ve ##olar duct junction , to be the prime target cells of sar ##s - co ##v infection . up ##re ##gul ##ated bas ##c mir ##nas - 17 * , - 57 ##4 - 5 ##p , and - 214 are co - opted by sar ##s - co ##v to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place . viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike protein targets seem to co - opt down ##re ##gul ##ated mir - 223 and mir - 98 respectively within bas ##cs to control the various stages of bas ##c differentiation , activation of inflammatory che ##mo ##kin ##es , and down ##re ##gul ##ation of ace ##2 . all these effectively accounts for a successful viral transmission and replication within bas ##cs causing continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair . overall , this investigation reveals another mode of exploitation of cellular mir ##na machinery by virus to their own advantage .  
background : the spike ( s ) protein is a major structural g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the s protein is a potent target for sar ##s - specific cell - mediated immune responses . however , the mechanism co ##v pathogen ##esis in sar ##s and the role of special ct ##ls in virus clearance are still largely un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized . here , we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel h ##la - a * 02 ##01 - restricted ep ##ito ##pe from conserved regions of s protein . results : first , different sar ##s - co ##v sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptide ##s from conserved regions of the s protein based upon h ##la - a * 02 ##01 binding and pro ##te ##osomal cleavage . four of eight candidate peptide ##s were tested by h ##la - a * 02 ##01 binding ass ##ays . among the four candidate peptide ##s , sp ##8 ( s ( 95 ##8 - 96 ##6 ) , v ##ln ##di ##ls ##rl ) induced specific ct ##ls both ex vivo in p ##bl ##s of healthy h ##la - a2 ( + ) donors and in h ##la - a2 . 1 / k ( b ) trans ##genic mice im ##mun ##ized with a pl ##as ##mi ##d encoding full - length s protein . the im ##mun ##ized mice released if ##n - γ and l ##yse ##d target cells upon stimulation with sp ##8 peptide - pulsed auto ##log ##ous den ##dr ##itic cells in comparison to other candidates . conclusion : these results suggest that sp ##8 is a naturally processed ep ##ito ##pe . we propose that sp ##8 ep ##ito ##pe should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
sar ##s - co ##v infection of human results in antigen - specific cellular and humor ##al immune responses . however , it is critical to determine whether sar ##s - co ##v - specific memory t cells can persist for long periods of time . in this study , we analyzed the cellular immune response from 21 sar ##s - recovered individuals who had been diagnosed with sar ##s in 2003 by using elisa , cb ##a , eli ##sp ##ot and multi ##para ##meter flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry ass ##ays . our results demonstrated that low levels of specific memory t cell responses to sar ##s - co ##v s , m , e and n peptide ##s were detected in a proportion of sar ##s - recovered patients , and if ##n - γ was the predominant cy ##tok ##ine produced by t cells after stimulation with peptide ##s . cy ##tom ##et ##ry analysis indicated that the majority of memory cd ##8 ( + ) t cells produced if ##n - γ , whereas memory cd ##4 ( + ) t cells produced if ##n - γ , il - 2 or tn ##f - α . these results might provide valuable information on the cellular immune response in recovered sar ##s - co ##v patients for the rational design of vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . not only can these cells support the growth of sar ##s - co ##v infection , but they are also capable of secret ##ing inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines to initiate and , eventually , ag ##gra ##vate host innate inflammatory responses , causing detrimental immune - mediated pathology within the lungs . thus , a comprehensive evaluation of the complex ep ##ith ##elial signaling to sar ##s - co ##v is crucial for paving the way to better understand sar ##s pathogen ##esis . based on micro ##ar ##ray - based functional gen ##omics , we report here the global gene response of 2 ##b ##4 cells , a clone ##d bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cell line derived from cal ##u - 3 cells . specifically , we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor ( n ##f ) κ ##b , act ##iva ##tor protein ( ap ) - 1 , and inter ##fer ##on regulatory factor ( ir ##f ) - 3 / 7 in infected 2 ##b ##4 cells at 12 - , 24 - , and 48 - hr ##s post infection ( p . i . ) , resulting in the activation of many anti ##vira ##l genes , including inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - β , - λ ##s , inflammatory media ##tors , and many if ##n - stimulated genes ( is ##gs ) . we also showed , for the first time , that if ##n - β and if ##n - λ ##s were capable of ex ##ert ##ing previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed , non - redundant , and complementary abilities to limit sar ##s - co ##v replication , even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2 ##b ##4 bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells until 48 hr ##s p . i . collectively , our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of anti ##vira ##l signaling pathway / s triggered by sar ##s - co ##v in bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies , aiming at advancing strategies against sar ##s .  
the emergence of viral respiratory pathogen ##s with pan ##de ##mic potential , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and influenza a h ##5 ##n ##1 , urges the need for dec ##ip ##hering their pathogen ##esis to develop new intervention strategies . sar ##s - co ##v infection causes acute lung injury ( ali ) that may develop into life - threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) with advanced age co ##rre ##lating positively with adverse disease outcome . the molecular pathways , however , that cause virus - induced ali / ar ##ds in aged individuals are ill - defined . here , we show that sar ##s - co ##v - infected aged mac ##aq ##ues develop more severe pathology than young adult animals , even though viral replication levels are similar . comprehensive gen ##omic analyses indicate that aged mac ##aq ##ues have a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult mac ##aq ##ues , with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation , with n ##f - κ ##b as central player , whereas expression of type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - β is reduced . therapeutic treatment of sar ##s - co ##v - infected aged mac ##aq ##ues with type i if ##n reduces pathology and dim ##ini ##sh ##es pro - inflammatory gene expression , including inter ##le ##uki ##n - 8 ( il - 8 ) levels , without affecting virus replication in the lungs . thus , ali in sar ##s - co ##v - infected aged mac ##aq ##ues developed as a result of an ex ##ace ##rba ##ted innate host response . the anti - inflammatory action of type i if ##n reveals a potential intervention strategy for virus - induced ali .  
we tested 12 bat species in ghana for corona ##virus ( co ##v ) rna . the virus prevalence in insect ##ivo ##rous bats ( n = 123 ) was 9 . 76 % . co ##v was not detected in 212 fe ##cal samples from e ##ido ##lon he ##l ##vu ##m fruit bats . leaf - nosed bats pertaining to hip ##po ##side ##ros rub ##er by morphology had group 1 and group 2 co ##vs . virus concentrations were < 45 , 000 copies / 100 mg of bat fe ##ces . the diversified group 1 co ##v shared a common ancestor with the human common cold virus hc ##ov - 229 ##e but not with hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , di ##sp ##uting h ##yp ##oth ##eses of common human descent . the most recent common ancestor of hc ##ov - 229 ##e and ghana ##bt - co ##v ##gr ##p ##1 existed in ≈ ##16 ##86 – 1800 ad . the ghana ##bt - co ##v ##gr ##p ##2 shared an old ancestor ( ≈ ##2 , 400 years ) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome – like group of co ##v .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged as a human disease in 2002 and detailed phylogenetic analysis and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies have suggested that the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) originated from animals . the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains at least three regions that are targeted by neutral ##izing antibodies in the s ##1 and s ##2 domains . we previously characterized a panel of neutral ##izing human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) but the majority of ep ##ito ##pes recognized by the mab ##s remained unknown . methods : in this study we generated neutral ##ization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutral ##ization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness . results : distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of mab ##s with differential neutral ##ization profiles . we also identified possible interactions between the s ##1 and s ##2 domains of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . finally , we showed that escape from neutral ##ization usually at ##ten ##uate ##s sar ##s - co ##v infection . conclusions : these data provide a mechanism to overcome neutral ##ization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktail ##s of cross - neutral ##izing mab ##s that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain , critical for virus replication and vi ##ru ##lence .  
while corona ##virus ##es were first identified nearly 60 years ago , they received notoriety in 2003 when one of their members was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 1 . previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enter ##ic infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15 % of all cases of the common cold . this review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of corona ##virus replication , interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogen ##esis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel corona ##virus ##es and the prop ##ens ##ity of this virus family to cross species barriers .  
among 176 patients who had had severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , sar ##s - specific antibodies were maintained for an average of 2 years , and significant reduction of im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g – positive percentage and ti ##ters occurred in the third year . thus , sar ##s patients might be susceptible to rein ##fect ##ion > 3 years after initial exposure .  
recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , and that rhino ##lo ##phi ##d bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v , which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during 2002 – 2003 . we examined the evolutionary relationships between bat co ##vs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase gene and the bat cy ##to ##chrome b gene . phylogenetic analyses showed multiple inc ##ong ##ru ##ent associations between the ph ##yl ##ogen ##ies of rhino ##lo ##phi ##d bats and their co ##vs , which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group . these shifts may be due to either virus bio ##logic traits or host behavioral traits . this finding has implications for the emergence of sar ##s and for the potential future emergence of sar ##s - co ##vs or related viruses .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection often caused severe end stage lung disease and organizing phase diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , especially in the elderly . the virus - host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown . to address this question , we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human ( urban ##i ) and a rec ##om ##bina ##nt mouse adapted sar ##s - co ##v , designated rm ##a1 ##5 . in contrast to most models of viral pathogen ##esis , infection of type i , type ii or type iii inter ##fer ##on knockout mice ( 129 background ) with either urban ##i or ma ##15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes , including transient weight loss , den ##uding bro ##nch ##iol ##itis and al ##ve ##olar inflammation and recovery , identical to that seen in infection of wild ##type mice . this suggests that type i , ii and iii inter ##fer ##on signaling play minor roles in regulating sar ##s pathogen ##esis in mouse models . in contrast , infection of stat ##1 ##− / − mice resulted in severe disease , high virus ti ##ter , extensive pulmonary lesions and 100 % mortality by day 9 and 30 post - infection with rm ##a1 ##5 or urban ##i viruses , respectively . non - lethal in bal ##b / c mice , urban ##i sar ##s - co ##v infection in stat ##1 ##− / − mice caused di ##sse ##minated infection involving the liver , sp ##leen and other tissues after day 9 . these findings demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis is regulated by a stat ##1 dependent but type i , ii and iii inter ##fer ##on receptor independent , mechanism . in contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity , we propose that stat ##1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrest ##rained cell proliferation .  
asian bats have been identified as potential reservoir hosts of corona ##virus ##es associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we detected antibody reactive with sar ##s - co ##v antigen in 47 ( 6 . 7 % ) of 70 ##5 bat serum specimens comprising 26 species collected in africa ; thus , african bats may harbor agents related to put ##ative group 4 co ##v .  
the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was caused by a newly emerged corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . bats of several species in southern people ’ s republic of china harbor sar ##s - like co ##vs and may be reservoir hosts for them . to determine whether bats in north america also harbor corona ##virus ##es , we used reverse transcription – pc ##r to detect corona ##virus rna in bats . we found corona ##virus rna in 6 of 28 fe ##cal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested . the prevalence of viral rna shed ##ding was high : 17 % in ep ##tes ##icus fu ##scu ##s and 50 % in my ##ot ##is occult ##us . sequence analysis of a 440 - bp amp ##lic ##on in gene 1b showed that these rocky mountain bat corona ##virus ##es formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 corona ##virus ##es of asian bats . because of the potential for bat corona ##virus ##es to cause disease in humans and animals , further surveillance and characterization of bat corona ##virus ##es in north america are needed .  
background : in the 2003 toronto sar ##s outbreak , sar ##s - co ##v was transmitted in hospitals despite adherence to infection control procedures . considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviour ##s were associated with the greatest risk of sar ##s - co ##v transmission . methods : a retrospective co ##hort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of sar ##s - co ##v during int ##uba ##tion from laboratory confirmed sar ##s patients to hc ##ws involved in their care . all sar ##s patients requiring int ##uba ##tion during the toronto outbreak were identified . all hc ##ws who provided care to int ##uba ##ted sar ##s patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after int ##uba ##tion were eligible for this study . data was collected on patients by chart review and on hc ##ws by interview ##er - administered question ##naire . generalized est ##imating equation ( gee ) log ##istic regression models and classification and regression trees ( cart ) were used to identify risk factors for sar ##s transmission . results : 45 laboratory - confirmed int ##uba ##ted sar ##s patients were identified . of the 69 ##7 hc ##ws involved in their care , 62 ##4 ( 90 % ) participated in the study . sar ##s - co ##v was transmitted to 26 hc ##ws from 7 patients ; 21 hc ##ws were infected by 3 patients . in multi ##var ##iate gee log ##istic regression models , presence in the room during fiber ##op ##tic int ##uba ##tion ( or = 2 . 79 , p = . 00 ##4 ) or ec ##g ( or = 3 . 52 , p = . 00 ##2 ) , un ##pro ##tec ##ted eye contact with secret ##ions ( or = 7 . 34 , p = . 001 ) , patient apache ii score ≥ ##20 ( or = 17 . 05 , p = . 00 ##9 ) and patient pa ##0 ( 2 ) / fi ##0 ( 2 ) ratio ≤ ##59 ( or = 8 . 65 , p = . 001 ) were associated with increased risk of transmission of sar ##s - co ##v . in cart analyses , the four co ##var ##iate ##s which explained the greatest amount of variation in sar ##s - co ##v transmission were co ##var ##iate ##s representing individual patients . conclusion : close contact with the air ##way of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secret ##ions were associated with transmission of sar ##s - co ##v . rates of transmission of sar ##s - co ##v varied widely among patients .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a life - threatening disease for which accurate diagnosis is essential . although many tools have been developed for the diagnosis of sar ##s , false - positive reactions in negative sera may occur because of cross - react ##ivity with other corona ##virus ##es . we have raised poly ##cl ##onal and mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( abs ) using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt form of the sar ##s virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . cross - react ##ivity of these anti - sar ##s abs against human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) 229 ##e and hc ##ov o ##c ##43 were determined by western b ##lot ##ting . the abs produced reacted with rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , but not with hc ##ov 229 ##e or hc ##ov o ##c ##43 .  
although in different groups , the corona ##virus ##es severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and nl ##6 ##3 use the same receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ( ace ) - 2 , for entry into the host cell . despite this common receptor , the consequence of entry is very different ; severe respiratory distress in the case of sar ##s - co ##v but frequently only a mild respiratory infection for nl ##6 ##3 . using a wholly rec ##om ##bina ##nt system , we have investigated the ability of each virus receptor - binding protein , spike or s protein , to bind to ace - 2 in solution and on the cell surface . in both ass ##ays , we find that the nl ##6 ##3 s protein has a weaker interaction with ace - 2 than the sar ##s - co ##v s protein , particularly in solution binding , but the residues required for contact are similar . we also confirm that the ace - 2 - binding site of nl ##6 ##3 s lies between residues 190 and 73 ##9 . a lower - affinity interaction with ace - 2 might partly explain the different path ##ological consequences of infection by sar ##s - co ##v and nl ##6 ##3 .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spreads rapidly and has a high case - mortality rate . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) of sar ##s - co ##v may be critical for pathogen ##ici ##ty . this study sought to discover the host proteins that interact with sar ##s - co ##v np . results : using surface pl ##as ##mon resonance bio ##mo ##le ##cular interaction analysis ( sp ##r / bi ##a ) and matrix - assisted laser des ##or ##ption / ion ##ization time of flight ( mal ##di - to ##f ) mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry , we found that only the pro ##tea ##some subunit p ##42 from human fetal lung dip ##loid fi ##bro ##bla ##st ( 2 ##bs ) cells bound to sar ##s - co ##v np . this interaction was confirmed by the g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase ( gs ##t ) fusion protein pull ##down technique . the co - local ##ization signal of sar ##s - co ##v np and pro ##tea ##some subunit p ##42 in 2 ##bs cells was detected using indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and con ##fo ##cal microscopy . p ##42 is a subunit of the 26 ##s pro ##tea ##some ; this large , multi - protein complex is a component of the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - pro ##tea ##some pathway , which is involved in a variety of basic cellular processes and inflammatory responses . conclusion : to our knowledge , this is the first report that sar ##s - co ##v np interact ##s with the pro ##tea ##some subunit p ##42 within host cells . these data enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##ici ##ty and the means by which sar ##s - co ##v interact ##s with host cells .  
pro ##te ##ol ##ytic pri ##ming is a common method of controlling the activation of membrane fusion mediated by viral g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s . the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus spike protein ( sar ##s - co ##v s ) can be prime ##d by a variety of host cell pro ##tea ##ses , with pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage occurring both as the s ##1 / s ##2 boundary and adjacent to a fusion peptide in the s ##2 domain . here , we studied the pri ##ming of sar ##s - co ##v s by el ##ast ##ase and show an important role for residue th ##r ( 79 ##5 ) in the s ##2 domain . a series of alan ##ine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the s ##2 cleavage site , with the goal of examining el ##ast ##ase - mediated cleavage within s ##2 . both pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage and fusion activation were mod ##ulated by altering the cleavage site position . we propose a novel mechanism whereby sar ##s - co ##v fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic pri ##ming site , with important implications for viral pathogen ##esis .  
bats are reservoirs for emerging zoo ##not ##ic viruses that can have a profound impact on human and animal health , including l ##ys ##sa ##virus ##es , fi ##lov ##irus ##es , para ##my ##x ##ov ##irus ##es , and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##vs ) . in the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in contexts where human - bat contact might facilitate more efficient inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission of viruses , we surveyed gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tissue obtained from bats collected in caves in nigeria that are frequented by humans . corona ##virus consensus pc ##r and un ##bia ##sed high - through ##put p ##yr ##ose ##que ##nc ##ing revealed the presence of corona ##virus sequences related to those of sar ##s - co ##v in a com ##mers ##on ’ s leaf - nosed bat ( hip ##po ##side ##ros com ##mers ##oni ) . additional gen ##omic sequencing indicated that this virus , unlike subgroup 2 ##b co ##vs , which includes sar ##s - co ##v , is unique , comprising three overlapping open reading frames between the m and n genes and two conserved stem - loop ii motifs . phylogenetic analyses in conjunction with these features suggest that this virus represents a new subgroup within group 2 co ##vs .  
background : the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v not only media ##tes receptor - binding but also induce ##s neutral ##izing antibodies . we previously identified the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of s protein as a major target of neutral ##izing antibodies in animal models and thus proposed a rb ##d - based vaccine . however , the antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of rb ##d in humans need to be characterized . results : two panels of serum samples from recovered sar ##s patients were included and the antibody responses against the rb ##d were measured by elisa and micro - neutral ##ization ass ##ays . we found that the rb ##d of s protein induced potent antibody responses in the recovered sar ##s patients and rb ##d - specific antibodies could persist at high ti ##ters over three year follow - up . furthermore , affinity pu ##rified anti - rb ##d antibodies possessed robust neutral ##izing activity . conclusion : the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v is highly im ##mun ##ogenic in humans and media ##tes protective responses and rb ##d - based vaccines and diagnostic approaches can be further developed .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging viral infectious disease . one of the largest outbreak ##s of sar ##s to date began in singapore in march 2003 . we describe the clinical , laboratory , and radio ##logic features of the index patient and the patient ’ s initial contacts affected with probable sar ##s .  
as of april 14 , 2003 , taiwan had had 23 probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , all imported . taiwan isolated these first 23 patients with probable sar ##s in negative - pressure rooms ; extensive personal protective equipment was used for healthcare workers and visitors . for the first 6 weeks of the sar ##s outbreak , recognized spread was limited to one healthcare worker and three household contacts .  
the genome of one taiwanese severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strain ( t ##w ##1 ) was 29 , 72 ##9 nt in length . viral rna may persist for some time in patients who ser ##oco ##n ##vert , and some patients may lack an antibody response ( im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ) to sar ##s - co ##v > 21 days after illness onset . an ups ##urg ##e of antibody response was associated with the ag ##gra ##vation of respiratory failure .  
an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred in singapore in march 2003 . to illustrate the problems in dia ##gno ##sing and containing sar ##s in the hospital , we describe a case series and highlight changes in tri ##age and infection control practices that resulted . by implementing these changes , we have stopped the nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of the virus .  
whether severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection can be as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic is unclear . we examined the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of sar ##s - co ##v among 67 ##4 healthcare workers from a hospital in which a sar ##s outbreak had occurred . a total of 35 ##3 ( 52 % ) experienced mild self - limiting illnesses , and 321 ( 48 % ) were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic throughout the course of these observations . none of these healthcare workers had antibody to sar ##s co ##v , indicating that sub ##cl ##ini ##cal or mild infection at ##tri ##bu ##table to sar ##s co ##v in adults is rare .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic was characterized by increased pathogen ##ici ##ty in the elderly due to an early ex ##ace ##rba ##ted innate host response . sar ##s - co ##v is a zoo ##not ##ic pathogen that entered the human population through an intermediate host like the palm ci ##vet . to prevent future introductions of zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v strains and subsequent transmission into the human population , het ##ero ##log ##ous disease models are needed to test the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic ##s against both late human and zoo ##not ##ic isolate ##s . here we show that both human and zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v strains can in ##fect cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues and resulted in radio ##logical as well as his ##top ##ath ##ological changes similar to those seen in mild human cases . viral replication was higher in animals infected with a late human phase isolate compared to a zoo ##not ##ic isolate . while there were significant differences in the number of host genes differential ##ly regulated during the host responses between the three sar ##s - co ##v strains , the top pathways and functions were similar and only apparent early during infection with the majority of genes associated with inter ##fer ##on signaling pathways . this study character ##izes critical disease models in the evaluation and li ##cens ##ure of therapeutic strategies against sar ##s - co ##v for human use .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the ae ##ti ##ological agent of the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . to gain a better understanding of sar ##s - co ##v replication and transcription proteins , a preliminary x - ray crystal ##log ##raphic study of the c - terminal domain of sar ##s - co ##v non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 2 ( ns ##p ##2 ) is reported here . the c - terminal domain of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##2 was clone ##d , over ##ex ##pressed , pu ##rified and crystal ##lized using poly ##eth ##yle ##ne g ##ly ##col 5000 mono ##met ##hyl ether as the pre ##ci ##pit ##ant ; the crystals di ##ff ##rac ##ted to 2 . 5 a resolution . the crystals belonged to space group p ##6 ( 5 ) , with unit - cell parameters a = b = 112 . 8 , c = 91 . 1 a , α = β = 90 , γ = 120 ##° . one molecule is assumed to be present per as ##ym ##metric unit , which gives a matthews coefficient of 2 . 89 a ( 3 ) da ( − ##1 ) and a solvent content of 56 . 2 % .  
it has been reported that lac ##to ##fer ##rin ( l ##f ) participates in the host immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) invasion by enhancing nk cell activity and stimulating ne ##ut ##rop ##hil aggregation and ad ##hesion . we further investigated the role of l ##f in the entry of sar ##s pseudo ##virus into he ##k ##29 ##3 ##e / ace ##2 - my ##c cells . our results reveal that l ##f inhibit ##s sar ##s pseudo ##virus infection in a dose - dependent manner . further analysis suggested that l ##f was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4 ##° ##c , indicating that l ##f ex ##erted its inhibitor ##y function at the viral attachment stage . however , l ##f did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the functional receptor of sar ##s - co ##v . previous studies have shown that l ##f col ##oca ##li ##zes with the widely distributed cell - surface he ##para ##n sulfate pro ##te ##og ##ly ##cans ( hs ##pg ##s ) . our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion . treatment of the cells with he ##par ##inas ##e or ex ##ogen ##ous he ##par ##in prevented binding of spike protein to host cells and inhibit ##ed sar ##s pseudo ##virus infection , demonstrating that hs ##pg ##s provide the binding sites for sar ##s - co ##v invasion at the early attachment phase . taken together , our results suggest that , in addition to ace ##2 , hs ##pg ##s are essential cell - surface molecules involved in sar ##s - co ##v cell entry . l ##f may play a protective role in host defense against sar ##s - co ##v infection through binding to hs ##pg ##s and blocking the preliminary interaction between sar ##s - co ##v and host cells . our findings may provide further understanding of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and aid in treatment of this deadly disease .  
bat corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) are put ##ative precursor ##s of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v and other co ##v that crossed the species barrier from zoo ##not ##ic reservoirs into the human population . to determine the presence and distribution of co ##v in iberian bats , 57 ##6 individuals of 26 different bat species were captured in 13 locations in spain . we report for the first time the presence of 14 corona ##virus ##es in 9 iberian bat species . phylogenetic analysis of a conserved co ##v genome region ( rd ##rp gene ) shows a wide diversity and distribution of alpha and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus in spain . interesting ##ly , although some of these viruses are related to other european bat ##co ##v , or to asian co ##v , some of the viruses found in spain cluster in new groups of α and β co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that lacks the envelope ( e ) gene ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e ) is at ##ten ##uated in vivo . to identify factors that contribute to rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e at ##ten ##uation , gene expression in cells infected by sar ##s - co ##v with or without e gene was compared . twenty - five stress response genes were prefer ##ential ##ly up ##re ##gul ##ated during infection in the absence of the e gene . in addition , genes involved in signal trans ##duction , transcription , cell metabolism , im ##mun ##ore ##gul ##ation , inflammation , ap ##op ##tosis and cell cycle and differentiation were differential ##ly regulated in cells infected with rs ##ars - co ##v with or without the e gene . administration of e protein in trans reduced the stress response in cells infected with rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e or with respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus , or treated with drugs , such as tunic ##amy ##cin and tha ##ps ##iga ##rg ##in that eli ##cit cell stress by different mechanisms . in addition , sar ##s - co ##v e protein down - regulated the signaling pathway in ##osi ##to ##l - requiring enzyme 1 ( ir ##e - 1 ) of the unfolded protein response , but not the p ##kr - like er kinase ( per ##k ) or act ##ivating transcription factor 6 ( at ##f - 6 ) pathways , and reduced cell ap ##op ##tosis . overall , the activation of the ir ##e - 1 pathway was not able to restore cell home ##osta ##sis , and ap ##op ##tosis was induced probably as a measure to protect the host by limiting virus production and dissemination . the expression of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines was reduced in rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e - infected cells compared to rs ##ars - co ##v - infected cells , suggesting that the increase in stress responses and the reduction of inflammation in the absence of the e gene contributed to the at ##ten ##uation of rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are important human and animal pathogen ##s that induce fatal respiratory , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal and neurological disease . the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 / 2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to ( corona ##virus ) co ##v epidemic ##s . neither vaccines nor therapeutic ##s are available against human and animal co ##vs . knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus - host interactions could define broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l targets . in this study , we used a systems biology approach employing a genome - wide yeast - two hybrid interaction screen to identify im ##mun ##op ##ili ##ns ( pp ##ia , pp ##ib , pp ##ih , pp ##ig , fk ##b ##p ##1 ##a , fk ##b ##p ##1 ##b ) as interaction partners of the co ##v non - structural protein 1 ( ns ##p ##1 ) . these molecules mod ##ulate the cal ##cine ##uri ##n / n ##fat pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation . over ##ex ##press ##ion of ns ##p ##1 and infection with live sar ##s - co ##v strongly increased signalling through the cal ##cine ##uri ##n / n ##fat pathway and enhanced the induction of inter ##le ##uki ##n 2 , compatible with late - stage im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogenic ##ity and long - term cy ##tok ##ine d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation as observed in severe sar ##s cases . conversely , inhibition of cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##ins by cy ##cl ##os ##por ##ine a ( cs ##pa ) blocked the replication of co ##vs of all genera , including sar ##s - co ##v , human co ##v - 229 ##e and - nl - 63 , fe ##line co ##v , as well as av ##ian infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus . non - im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive derivatives of cs ##pa might serve as broad - range co ##v inhibitors applicable against emerging co ##vs as well as ubiquitous pathogen ##s of humans and livestock .  
severe acute respiratory corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 , resulting in roughly 800 ##0 cases worldwide and 10 % mortality . the animal reservoirs for sar ##s - co ##v precursor ##s still exist and the likelihood of future outbreak ##s in the human population is high . the sar ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##p ) is an attractive target for pharmaceutical development because it is essential for virus replication and is conserved among human corona ##virus ##es . a yeast - based ass ##ay was established for pl ##p activity that relies on the ability of pl ##p to induce a pronounced slow - growth ph ##eno ##type when expressed in s . ce ##re ##vis ##iae . induction of the slow - growth ph ##eno ##type was shown to take place over a 60 - hour time course , providing the basis for conducting a screen for small molecules that restore growth by inhibit ##ing the function of pl ##p . five chemical suppress ##ors of the slow - growth ph ##eno ##type were identified from the 2000 member ni ##h diversity set library . one of these , ns ##c ##15 ##8 ##36 ##2 , potent ##ly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication in cell culture without toxic effects on cells , and it specifically inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication but not influenza virus replication . the effect of ns ##c ##15 ##8 ##36 ##2 on pl ##p pro ##tea ##se , de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inas ##e and anti - inter ##fer ##on activities was investigated but the compound did not alter these activities . another suppress ##or , ns ##c ##15 ##80 ##11 , demonstrated the ability to inhibit pl ##p pro ##tea ##se activity in a cell - based ass ##ay . the identification of these inhibitors demonstrated a strong functional connection between the pl ##p - based yeast ass ##ay , the inhibitor ##y compounds , and sar ##s - co ##v biology . furthermore the data with ns ##c ##15 ##8 ##36 ##2 suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v replication that may involve an unknown activity of pl ##p , or alternatively a direct effect on a cellular target that mod ##ifies or bypass ##es pl ##p function in yeast and mammalian cells .  
background : the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome en ##codes several unique group specific accessory proteins with unknown functions . among them , accessory protein 3 ##b ( also known as or ##f ##4 ) was lately identified as one of the viral inter ##fer ##on antagonist . recently our lab uncovered a new role for 3 ##b in up ##re ##gul ##ation of ap - 1 transcription ##al activity and its downstream genes . thus , we believe that 3 ##b might play an important role in sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and therefore is of considerable interest . the current study aims at identifying novel host cellular interact ##ors of the 3 ##b protein . methodology / principal findings : in this study , using yeast two - hybrid and co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation techniques , we have identified a host transcription factor run ##x ##1 ##b ( run ##t related transcription factor , iso ##form b ) as a novel interacting partner for sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##b protein . ch ##rom ##atin im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ai ##on ( chip ) and reporter gene ass ##ays in 3 ##b expressing ju ##rka ##t cells showed recruitment of 3 ##b on the run ##x ##1 binding element that led to an increase in run ##x ##1 ##b trans ##act ##ivation potential on the il ##2 promoter . kinase ass ##ay and ph ##arm ##aco ##logical inhibitor treatment implied that 3 ##b also affect run ##x ##1 ##b transcription ##al activity by regulating its er ##k dependent ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation levels . additionally , mrna levels of mi ##p - 1 ##α , a run ##x ##1 ##b target gene up ##re ##gul ##ated in sar ##s - co ##v infected mono ##cy ##te - derived den ##dr ##itic cells , were found to be elevated in 3 ##b expressing u ##9 ##37 mono ##cy ##te cells . conclusions / significance : these results un ##ve ##il a novel interaction of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##b with the host factor , run ##x ##1 ##b , and spec ##ulate its physiological relevance in up ##re ##gul ##ating cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##e levels in state of sar ##s virus infection .  
bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoo ##not ##ic viruses , including hen ##ip ##avi ##rus ##es and variants of ra ##bies viruses . recently , we and another group independently identified several horseshoe bat species ( genus rhino ##lo ##phus ) as the reservoir host for a large number of viruses that have a close genetic relationship with the corona ##virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . our current research focused on the identification of the reservoir species for the pro ##gen ##itor virus of the sar ##s corona ##virus ##es responsible for outbreak ##s during 2002 – 2003 and 2003 – 2004 . in addition to sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es , many other novel bat corona ##virus ##es , which belong to groups 1 and 2 of the 3 existing corona ##virus groups , have been detected by pc ##r . the discovery of bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es and the great genetic diversity of corona ##virus ##es in bats have shed new light on the origin and transmission of sar ##s corona ##virus ##es .  
given the potential for laboratory - associated severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infections , we must know which cell lines are susceptible to the virus . we investigated 21 cell lines routinely used for virus isolation or research . after infection with sar ##s - co ##v , cells were observed for cy ##top ##athic effects , and quantitative real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction was used to measure ongoing viral replication . an indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay was also used as a confirm ##atory test . the study identified 10 new cell lines capable of supporting the replication of sar ##s - co ##v and confirmed the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of 4 cell lines previously reported . this study shows that sar ##s - co ##v can be isolated in several cell lines commonly used for diagnostic or research purposes . it also shows that sar ##s - co ##v can achieve high ti ##ters in several cell lines , sometimes in the absence of specific cy ##top ##athic effects .  
with the rapid international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) from march through may 2003 , canada introduced various measures to screen airplane passengers at selected airports for symptoms and signs of sar ##s . the world health organization requested that all affected areas screen departing passengers for sar ##s symptoms . in spite of intensive screening , no sar ##s cases were detected . sar ##s has an extremely low prevalence , and the positive predict ##ive value of screening is essentially zero . canadian screening results raise questions about the effectiveness of available screening measures for sar ##s at international borders .  
to determine the prevalence of ina ##ppa ##rent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) among healthcare workers , we performed a ser ##os ##ur ##vey to test for im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) g antibodies to the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) among 1 , 147 healthcare workers in 3 hospitals that admitted sar ##s patients in mid - may 2003 . among them were 90 healthcare workers with sar ##s . as a reference group , 70 ##9 healthcare workers who worked in 2 hospitals that never admitted any sar ##s patients were similarly tested . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce rate was 88 . 9 % ( 80 / 90 ) for healthcare workers with sar ##s and 1 . 4 % ( 15 / 1 , 05 ##7 ) for healthcare workers who were apparently healthy . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce in the reference group was 0 . 4 % ( 3 / 70 ##9 ) . these findings suggest that ina ##ppa ##rent infection is uncommon . low level of immunity among unaffected healthcare workers reinforce ##s the need for adequate personal protection and other infection control measures in hospitals to prevent future epidemic ##s .  
we compared the clinical features of 8 u . s . case - patients with laboratory - confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) to 65 controls who tested negative for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . short ##ness of breath , vomiting , dia ##rr ##hea , progressive bilateral infiltrate ##s on chest radio ##graph , and need for supplemental oxygen were significantly associated with confirmed sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a zoo ##not ##ic disease caused by sar ##s - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that emerged in 2002 to become a global health concern . although the original outbreak was controlled by classical public health measures , there is a real risk that another sar ##s - co ##v could re - emerge from its natural reservoir , either in its original form or as a more vi ##ru ##lent or pathogen ##ic strain ; in which case , the virus would be difficult to control in the absence of any effective anti ##vira ##l drugs or vaccines . using the well - studied sar ##s - co ##v isolate hk ##u - 39 ##8 ##49 , we developed a va ##cci ##nia virus - based sar ##s - co ##v reverse genetic system that is both robust and bio ##sa ##fe . the sar ##s - co ##v genome was clone ##d in separate va ##cci ##nia virus vectors , ( vs ##ars - co ##v - 5 ##pr ##ime and vs ##ars - co ##v - 3 ##pr ##ime ) as two cd ##nas that were subsequently liga ##ted to create a genome - length sar ##s - co ##v cd ##na template for in vitro transcription of sar ##s - co ##v infectious rna transcript ##s . trans ##fect ##ion of the rna transcript ##s into per ##missive cells led to the recovery of infectious virus ( rec ##sar ##s - co ##v ) . characterization of the plaques produced by rec ##sar ##s - co ##v showed that they were similar in size to the parental sar ##s - co ##v isolate hk ##u - 39 ##8 ##49 but smaller than the sar ##s - co ##v isolate frankfurt - 1 . comparative analysis of replication kinetic ##s showed that the kinetic ##s of rec ##sar ##s - co ##v replication are similar to those of sar ##s - co ##v frankfurt - 1 , although the ti ##ters of virus released into the culture super ##nat ##ant are approximately 10 - fold less . the reverse genetic system was finally used to generate a rec ##sar ##s - co ##v reporter virus expressing ren ##illa lucifer ##ase in order to facilitate the analysis of sar ##s - co ##v gene expression in human den ##dr ##itic cells ( hd ##cs ) . in parallel , a ren ##illa lucifer ##ase gene was also inserted into the genome of human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) . using this approach , we demonstrate that , in contrast to hc ##ov - 229 ##e , sar ##s - co ##v is not able to media ##te efficient het ##ero ##log ##ous gene expression in hd ##cs .  
we describe a new approach for infectious disease surveillance that facilitates rapid identification of known and emerging pathogen ##s . the process uses broad - range polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) to amp ##li ##fy nuclei ##c acid targets from large grouping ##s of organisms , electro ##sp ##ray ion ##ization mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry for accurate mass measurements of pc ##r products , and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample . we demonstrate this principle by using 14 isolate ##s of 9 diverse corona ##virus spp . , including the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we show that this method could identify and distinguish between sar ##s and other known co ##v , including the human co ##v 229 ##e and o ##c ##43 , individually and in a mixture of all 3 human viruses . the sensitivity of detection , measured by using ti ##tered sar ##s - co ##v spiked into human serum , was ≈ ##1 p ##fu / ml . this approach , applicable to the surveillance of bacterial , viral , fungal , or proto ##zo ##al pathogen ##s , is capable of automated analysis of > 900 pc ##r reactions per day .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated : corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was isolated from a pig during a survey for possible routes of viral transmission after a sar ##s epidemic . sequence and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology analyses suggested that the pig was infected by a sar ##s - co ##v of human origin .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein ( s ) is a major target for neutral ##izing antibodies . retro ##vira ##l sar ##s - co ##v s pseudo ##type ##s have been constructed and used to develop an in vitro micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ay that is both sensitive and specific for sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies . neutral ##ization ti ##ters measured by this ass ##ay are highly correlated to those measured by an ass ##ay using replication - competent sar ##s - co ##v . no cross - neutral ##ization occurred with human sera known to contain antibodies to corona ##virus strains o ##c ##43 and 229 ##e . the pseudo ##type ass ##ay was used to profile neutral ##izing antibody responses against sar ##s - co ##v s in sequential serum samples taken from 41 confirmed sar ##s patients during the 2003 outbreak in hong kong and shows long - lasting immunity in most recovered patients . the pseudo ##type ass ##ay does not require handling live sar ##s virus ; it is a useful tool to determine neutral ##izing ti ##ters during natural infection and the pre ##cl ##ini ##cal evaluation of candidate vaccines .  
to understand different aspects of community responses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , 2 population - based , random telephone surveys were conducted in june 2003 and january 2004 in hong kong . more than 70 % of respondents would avoid visiting hospitals or mainland china to avoid contracting sar ##s . most respondents believed that sar ##s could be transmitted through droplets , f ##omi ##tes , sewage , and animals . more than 90 % believed that public health measures were e ##ffi ##ca ##cious means of prevention ; 40 . 4 % believed that sar ##s would res ##urg ##e in hong kong ; and ≈ ##70 % would then wear masks in public places . high percentage ##s of respondents felt helpless , horrified , and app ##re ##hen ##sive because of sar ##s . approximately 16 % showed signs of post ##tra ##umatic symptoms , and ≈ ##40 % perceived increased stress in family or work settings . the general public in hong kong has been very vi ##gil ##ant about sar ##s but needs to be more psychological ##ly prepared to face a resurgence of the epidemic .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) from palm ci ##vet ##s has twice evolved the capacity to in ##fect humans by gaining binding affinity for human receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of different sar ##s - co ##v strains isolated from humans or ci ##vet ##s . why these mutations were naturally selected or how sar ##s - co ##v evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood , presenting evolutionary and epidemic con ##und ##rum ##s . in this study , we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition , an important deter ##mina ##nt of sar ##s - co ##v infection and pathogen ##esis . using a combination of bio ##chemical , functional , and crystal ##log ##raphic approaches , we el ##uc ##ida ##ted the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected rb ##d mutations . these mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce un ##fa ##vor ##able interactions with two virus - binding hot spots on ace ##2 , and by doing so , they enhance viral interactions with either human ( ha ##ce ##2 ) or ci ##vet ( ca ##ce ##2 ) ace ##2 . therefore , these mutations were viral adaptations to either ha ##ce ##2 or ca ##ce ##2 . to co ##rro ##bor ##ate the above analysis , we designed and characterized two opt ##imi ##zed rb ##ds . the human - opt ##imi ##zed rb ##d contains all of the ha ##ce ##2 - adapted residues ( ph ##e - 44 ##2 , ph ##e - 47 ##2 , as ##n - 47 ##9 , as ##p - 480 , and th ##r - 48 ##7 ) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for ha ##ce ##2 but relative low affinity for ca ##ce ##2 . the ci ##vet - opt ##imi ##zed rb ##d contains all of the ca ##ce ##2 - adapted residues ( ty ##r - 44 ##2 , pro - 47 ##2 , ar ##g - 47 ##9 , g ##ly - 480 , and th ##r - 48 ##7 ) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for ca ##ce ##2 and also substantial affinity for ha ##ce ##2 . these results not only illustrate the detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation by sar ##s - co ##v but also provide a molecular and structural basis for tracking future sar ##s - co ##v evolution in animals .  
ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol kinase ##s ( pi kinase ##s ) play an important role in the life cycle of several viruses after infection . using gene knock ##down technology , we demonstrate that ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol 4 - kinase iii ##β ( pi ##4 ##k ##b ) is required for cellular entry by pseudo ##virus ##es bearing the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein and that the cell entry mediated by sar ##s - co ##v spike protein is strongly inhibit ##ed by knock ##down of pi ##4 ##k ##b . consistent with this observation , ph ##arm ##aco ##logical inhibitors of pi ##4 ##k ##b blocked entry of sar ##s pseudo ##vir ##ions . further research suggested that pi ##4 ##p plays an essential role in sar ##s - co ##v spike - mediated entry , which is regulated by the pi ##4 ##p lip ##id micro ##en ##vir ##on ##ment . we further demonstrate that pi ##4 ##k ##b does not affect virus entry at the sar ##s - co ##v s - ace ##2 binding interface or at the stage of virus internal ##ization but rather at or before virus fusion . taken together , these results indicate a new function for pi ##4 ##k ##b and suggest a new drug target for preventing sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
a peptide - based enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) can be used for retrospective ser ##os ##ur ##ve ##illa ##nce of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) by helping identify und ##ete ##cted chains of disease transmission . the ass ##ay was developed by ep ##ito ##pe mapping , using synthetic peptide ##s from the spike , membrane , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein sequences of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus . the new peptide elisa consistently detected ser ##oco ##n ##version by week 2 of onset of fever , and ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity remained through day 100 . specific ##ity was 100 % on normal blood donor samples , on serum samples associated with infection by other pathogen ##s , and on an interference panel . the peptide - based test has advantages of safety , standardization , and automation over previous im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys for sar ##s . the ass ##ay was used for a retrospective survey of healthy healthcare workers in taiwan who treated sar ##s patients . as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ser ##oco ##n ##version ##s were detected in two hospitals that had nos ##oco ##mia ##l disease .  
a total of 1 , 06 ##8 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic close contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory ( sar ##s ) from the 2003 epidemic in hong kong were ser ##ological ##ly tested , and 2 ( 0 . 19 % ) were positive for sar ##s corona ##virus im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g antibody . sar ##s rarely manifest ##s as a sub ##cl ##ini ##cal infection , and at present , wild animal species are the only important natural reservoirs of the virus .  
a few months after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak , a sample of canadian undergraduate university students completed a question ##naire that showed that , despite believing media coverage of the outbreak was excessive , they had little anxiety about acquiring sar ##s . additionally , 69 % of participants failed a sar ##s - specific knowledge section of the question ##naire .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) – related risk perceptions , knowledge , pre ##ca ##ution ##ary actions , and information sources were studied in the netherlands during the 2003 sar ##s outbreak . although respondents were highly aware of the sar ##s outbreak , the outbreak did not result in unnecessary pre ##ca ##ution ##ary actions or fears .  
during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in taiwan , > 150 , 000 persons were qu ##aran ##tine ##d , 24 of whom were later found to have laboratory - confirmed sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . since no evidence exists that sar ##s - co ##v is in ##fect ##ive before the onset of symptoms and the qu ##aran ##tine ##d persons were exposed but not sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , we thought the qu ##aran ##tine ' s effectiveness should be investigated . using the taiwan qu ##aran ##tine data , we found that the onset - to - diagnosis time of previously qu ##aran ##tine ##d confirmed case - patients was significantly shortened compared to that for those who had not been qu ##aran ##tine ##d . thus , qu ##aran ##tine for sar ##s in taiwan screened potentially in ##fect ##ive persons for swift diagnosis and hospital ##ization after onset , thereby indirectly reducing infections . full - scale qu ##aran ##tine measures implemented on april 28 led to a significant improvement in onset - to - diagnosis time of all sar ##s patients , regardless of previous qu ##aran ##tine status . we discuss the temporal effects of qu ##aran ##tine measures and other interventions on detection and isolation as well as the potential useful ##ness of qu ##aran ##tine in faster identification of persons with sar ##s and in improving isolation measures .  
late recognition of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was associated with no known sar ##s contact , hospital ##ization before the nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak was recognized , sy ##mpt ##om onset while hospitalized , wards with sar ##s clusters , and post ##oper ##ative status . sar ##s is difficult to recognize in hospitalized patients with a variety of underlying conditions in the absence of ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic links .  
efforts to contain severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) have been limited by the lack of a standardized , sensitive , and specific test for sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . we used a standardized reverse transcription - polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay to detect sar ##s - co ##v in lung samples obtained from well - characterized patients who died of sar ##s and from those who died of other reasons . sar ##s - co ##v was detected in all 22 post ##mo ##rte ##m lung tissues ( to 10 ( 9 ) viral copies / g ) from 11 patients with probable sar ##s but was not detected in any of the 23 lung control samples ( sample analysis was blinded ) . the sensitivity and specific ##ity ( 95 % confidence interval ) were 100 % ( 84 . 6 % to 100 % ) and 100 % ( 85 . 1 % to 100 % ) , respectively . viral loads were significantly associated with a shorter course of illness but not with the use of rib ##avi ##rin or ste ##roids . co ##v was consistently identified in the lungs of all patients who died of sar ##s but not in control patients , supporting a primary role for co ##v in deaths .  
we evaluated a virus - infected cell - based indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay for detecting anti – severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) g antibody . all confirmed sar ##s cases demonstrated ser ##oco ##n ##version or four ##fold rise in i ##gg antibody ti ##ter ; no control was positive . sensitivity and specific ##ity of this ass ##ay were both 100 % . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay can as ##cer ##tain the status of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
acute pneumonia developed in a previously healthy man during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in southern china in march 2003 . anti ##biotic treatment was ineffective , and he died 8 days after illness onset . human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus was isolated from lung tissue . no other pathogen was found . other et ##iol ##og ##ic agents should thus be sought in apparent sar ##s cases when corona ##virus infection cannot be confirmed .  
during the recent severe acute respiratory ( sar ##s ) outbreak , the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent was identified as a new corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . we have isolated a sar ##s - associated co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strain by in ##ject ##ing ve ##ro cells with a sp ##ut ##um specimen from an italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia ; the patient traveled from vietnam to italy in march 2003 . ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural analysis of infected ve ##ro cells showed the vi ##rion ##s within cell ve ##sic ##les and around the cell membrane . the full - length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the hong - kong hotel m isolate . by using both real - time reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ta ##q ##man ass ##ay and an in ##fect ##ivity plaque ass ##ay , we determined that approximately 360 viral genome ##s were required to generate a p ##fu . in addition , he ##par ##in ( 100 μ ##g / ml ) inhibit ##ed infection of ve ##ro cells by 50 % . overall , the molecular and bio ##logic characteristics of the strain hs ##r ##1 provide evidence that sar ##s - co ##v forms a fourth genetic corona ##virus group with distinct gen ##omic and bio ##logic features .  
we report a laboratory - confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in a pregnant woman . although the patient had respiratory failure , a healthy infant was subsequently delivered , and the mother is now well . there was no evidence of viral shed ##ding at delivery . antibodies to sar ##s virus were detected in cord blood and breast milk .  
using im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and neutral ##ization ass ##ays , we detected antibodies to human severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and / or animal sar ##s - co ##v – like virus in 17 ( 1 . 8 % ) of 93 ##8 adults recruited in 2001 . this finding suggests that a small proportion of healthy persons in hong kong had been exposed to sar ##s - related viruses at least 2 years before the recent sar ##s outbreak .  
a real - time reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the ass ##ay , based on multiple prime ##r and probe sets located in different regions of the sar ##s - co ##v genome , could disc ##rim ##inate sar ##s - co ##v from other human and animal corona ##virus ##es with a potential detection limit of < 10 gen ##omic copies per reaction . the real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay was more sensitive than a conventional rt - pc ##r ass ##ay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect sar ##s - co ##v in clinical specimens . application of this ass ##ay will aid in dia ##gno ##sing sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
infection of healthcare workers with the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory drop ##let transmission . however , in ##fr ##e ##quent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and drop ##let precautions , particularly during certain aero ##sol - generating medical procedures . we investigated a possible cluster of sar ##s - co ##v infections in healthcare workers who used contact and drop ##let precautions during attempted card ##io ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry res ##us ##cit ##ation of a sar ##s patient . unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aero ##sol - generating procedures , the index case - patient was un ##res ##pon ##sive , and the int ##uba ##tion procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty . however , before int ##uba ##tion , the patient was vent ##ila ##ted with a bag - valve - mask that may have contributed to aero ##sol ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v . on the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of sar ##s transmission during aero ##sol - generating procedures , a systematic approach to the problem is outlined , including the use of the following : 1 ) administrative controls , 2 ) environmental engineering controls , 3 ) personal protective equipment , and 4 ) quality control .  
cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) were investigated for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) through rna tests , ser ##olo ##gic response , and viral culture . of 53 ##7 specimens from patients in whom sar ##s was clinical ##ly diagnosed , 332 ( 60 % ) had sar ##s - co ##v rna in one or more clinical specimens , compared with 1 ( 0 . 3 % ) of 332 samples from controls . of 417 patients with clinical sar ##s from whom paired serum samples were available , 92 % had an antibody response . rates of viral rna po ##sit ##ivity increased progressively and peaked at day 11 after onset of illness . although viral rna remained detect ##able in respiratory secret ##ions and stool and urine specimens for > 30 days in some patients , virus could not be culture ##d after week 3 of illness . nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates , throat sw ##ab ##s , or sp ##ut ##um samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness , but later in the illness viral rna could be detected more readily in stool specimens .  
an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in humans , associated with a new corona ##virus , was reported in southeast asia , europe , and north america in early 2003 . to address speculation ##s that the virus originated in domestic ##ated animals , or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus , we in ##oc ##ulated 6 - week - old pigs and chickens intra ##ven ##ously , intra ##nas ##ally , o ##cular ##ly , and oral ##ly with 10 ( 6 ) p ##fu of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . clinical signs did not develop in any animal , nor were gross path ##olo ##gic changes evident on post ##mo ##rte ##m examinations . attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful ; however , viral rna was detected by reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after in ##oc ##ulation , and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after in ##oc ##ulation . virus - neutral ##izing antibodies developed in the pigs . our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amp ##li ##fying hosts for sar ##s - co ##v .  
early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . no rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out sar ##s among patients with feb ##ril ##e respiratory illnesses . clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish sar ##s from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions . a balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of sar ##s without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinic ##ians not only to look for suggest ##ive clinical features but also to routinely seek ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic clues suggest ##ive of sar ##s corona ##virus exposure . key ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic risk factors include 1 ) exposure to settings where sar ##s activity is suspected or documented , or 2 ) in the absence of such exposure , ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic link ##age to other persons with pneumonia ( i . e . , pneumonia clusters ) , or 3 ) exposure to healthcare settings . when combined with clinical findings , these ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic features provide a possible strategic framework for early recognition of sar ##s .  
in response to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the united states established national surveillance using a sensitive case definition incorporating clinical , ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic , and laboratory criteria . of 1 , 460 une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d respiratory illnesses reported by state and local health departments to the centers for disease control and prevention from march 17 to july 30 , 2003 , a total of 39 ##8 ( 27 % ) met clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic sar ##s case criteria . of these , 72 ( 18 % ) were probable cases with radio ##graphic evidence of pneumonia . eight ( 2 % ) were laboratory - confirmed sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infections , 206 ( 52 % ) were sar ##s - co ##v negative , and 184 ( 46 % ) had und ##eter ##mined sar ##s - co ##v status because of missing con ##vale ##scent - phase serum specimens . thirty - one percent ( 124 / 39 ##8 ) of case - patients were hospitalized ; none died . travel was the most common ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic link ( 329 / 39 ##8 , 83 % ) , and mainland china was the affected area most commonly visited . one case of possible household transmission was reported , and no laboratory - confirmed infections occurred among healthcare workers . successes and limitations of this emergency surveillance can guide preparations for future outbreak ##s of sar ##s or respiratory diseases of unknown et ##iology .  
to better assess the risk for transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , we obtained serial specimens and clinical and exposure data from seven confirmed u . s . sar ##s patients and their 10 household contacts . sar ##s - co ##v was detected in a day - 14 sp ##ut ##um specimen from one case - patient and in five stool specimens from two case - patients . in one case - patient , sar ##s - co ##v persisted in stool for at least 26 days after sy ##mpt ##om onset . the highest amounts of virus were in the day - 14 sp ##ut ##um sample and a day - 14 stool sample . residual respiratory symptoms were still present in recovered sar ##s case - patients 2 months after illness onset . possible transmission of sar ##s - co ##v occurred in one household contact , but this person had also traveled to a sar ##s - affected area . the data suggest that sar ##s - co ##v is not always transmitted efficiently . laboratory diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v infection is difficult ; thus , sp ##ut ##um and stool specimens should be included in the diagnostic work - up for sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
we describe a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) whose clinical symptoms were masked by es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli ba ##cter ##emia . sar ##s developed in a cluster of healthcare workers who had contact with this patient . sar ##s was diagnosed when a chest infiltrate developed and when the patient ’ s brother was hospitalized with acute respiratory failure . we highlight problems in at ##yp ##ical cases and offer infection control suggestions .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in vietnam was amplified by nos ##oco ##mia ##l spread within hospital a , but no transmission was reported in hospital b , the second of two designated sar ##s hospitals . our study documents lack of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus transmission to hospital b workers , despite variable infection control measures and the use of personal protective equipment .  
a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by a novel corona ##virus began in march 2003 . the rapid emergence of sar ##s and the substantial illness and death it caused have made it a critical public health issue . because no effective treatments are available , an intensive effort is under way to identify and test promising anti ##vira ##l drugs . here , we report that rec ##om ##bina ##nt human inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - β 1a potent ##ly inhibit ##s sar ##s corona ##virus replication in vitro .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has raised a global alert since march 2003 . after its ca ##usa ##tive agent , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was confirmed , laboratory methods , including virus isolation , reverse transcript ##ase – polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , and ser ##olo ##gic methods , have been quickly developed . in this study , we evaluated four ser ##olo ##gic tests ( neutral ##ization test , enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay [ elisa ] , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent ass ##ay [ if ##a ] , and im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic test [ ict ] ) for detecting antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v in sera of 53 ##7 probable sar ##s case - patients with correlation to the rt - pc ##r . with the neutral ##ization test as a reference method , the sensitivity , specific ##ity , positive predict ##ive value , and negative predict ##ive value were 98 . 2 % , 98 . 7 % , 98 . 7 % , and 98 . 4 % for elisa ; 99 . 1 % , 87 . 8 % , 88 . 1 % and 99 . 1 % for if ##a ; 33 . 6 % , 98 . 2 % , 95 . 7 % , and 56 . 1 % for ict , respectively . we also compared the rec ##om ##bina ##nt - based western b ##lot with the whole virus – based if ##a and elisa ; the data showed a high correlation between these methods , with an overall agreement of > 90 % . our results provide a systematic analysis of ser ##olo ##gic and molecular methods for evaluating sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
on day 22 of illness , generalized tonic - cl ##onic con ##vu ##ls ##ion developed in a 32 - year - old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid tested positive for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) by reverse transcript ##ase – polymer ##ase chain reaction . sar ##s - co ##v may have caused an infection in the central nervous system in this patient .  
during the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 , treatment was em ##pi ##ric . we report the case history of the index patient in a hospital outbreak of sar ##s in hong kong . the patient recovered after conventional anti ##mic ##ro ##bial therapy . further studies are needed to address treatment of sar ##s , which has high attack and death rates .  
despite infection control measures , breakthrough transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred for many hospital workers in hong kong . we conducted a case - control study of 72 hospital workers with sar ##s and 144 matched controls . inconsistent use of go ##ggles , gown ##s , gloves , and caps was associated with a higher risk for sar ##s infection ( una ##d ##just ##ed odds ratio 2 . 42 to 20 . 54 , p < 0 . 05 ) . the likelihood of sar ##s infection was strongly associated with the amount of personal protection equipment perceived to be inadequate , having < 2 hours of infection control training , and not understanding infection control procedures . no significant differences existed between the case and control groups in the proportion of workers who performed high - risk procedures , reported minor protection equipment problems , or had social contact with sar ##s - infected persons . perceived ina ##de ##qua ##cy of personal protection equipment supply , infection control training < 2 hours , and inconsistent use of personal protection equipment when in contact with sar ##s patients were significant independent risk factors for sar ##s infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was first described during a 2002 – 2003 global outbreak of severe pneumonia associated with human deaths and person - to - person disease transmission . the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent was initially identified as a corona ##virus by thin - section electron microscopic examination of a virus isolate . vi ##rion ##s were spherical , 78 nm in mean diameter , and composed of a he ##lica ##l nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id within an envelope with surface projections . here ##in , we show that infection with the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus resulted in distinct ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural features : double - membrane ve ##sic ##les , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id inclusion ##s , and large gran ##ular areas of cy ##top ##las ##m . these three structures and the corona ##virus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and rna by using ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural im ##mun ##ogo ##ld and in situ hybrid ##ization ass ##ays . in addition , ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural examination of a bro ##nch ##iol ##ar lava ##ge specimen from a sar ##s patient showed numerous corona ##virus - infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells . electron microscopic studies were critical in identifying the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of the sar ##s outbreak and in guiding subsequent laboratory and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigations .  
during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak , a real - time quantitative polymer ##ase chain reaction , which targets the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene at the 3 ′ - end of the viral genome , was established to detect and identify the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus . we describe the use of this ass ##ay to screen > 700 clinical samples .  
serum samples were obtained from healthcare workers 5 weeks after exposure to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . a sensitive dot b ##lot enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay , complement ##ed by a specific neutral ##ization test , shows that only persons in whom probable sar ##s was diagnosed had specific antibodies and suggests that sub ##cl ##ini ##cal sar ##s is not an important feature of the disease .  
healthcare workers accounted for a large proportion of persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) during the worldwide epidemic of early 2003 . we conducted an investigation of healthcare workers exposed to laboratory - confirmed sar ##s patients in the united states to evaluate infection - control practices and possible sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) transmission . we identified 110 healthcare workers with exposure within drop ##let range ( i . e . , 3 feet ) to six sar ##s - co ##v – positive patients . forty - five healthcare workers had exposure without any mask use , 72 had exposure without eye protection , and 40 reported direct skin - to - skin contact . potential drop ##let - and aero ##sol - generating procedures were in ##fr ##e ##quent : 5 % of healthcare workers manipulated a patient ’ s air ##way , and 4 % administered aero ##sol ##ized medication . despite numerous un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure ##s , there was no ser ##olo ##gic evidence of healthcare - related sar ##s - co ##v transmission . lack of transmission in the united states may be related to the relative absence of high - risk procedures or patients , factors that may place healthcare workers at higher risk for infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . currently , no effective drug exists to treat sar ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we investigated whether a panel of commercially available anti ##vira ##l drugs exhibit in vitro anti – sar ##s - co ##v activity . a drug - screening ass ##ay that scores for virus - induced cy ##top ##athic effects on culture ##d cells was used . tested were 19 clinical ##ly approved compounds from several major anti ##vira ##l ph ##arm ##aco ##logic classes : nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog ##s , inter ##fer ##ons , pro ##tea ##se inhibitors , reverse transcript ##ase inhibitors , and ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e inhibitors . complete inhibition of cy ##top ##athic effects of sar ##s - co ##v in culture was observed for inter ##fer ##on sub ##type ##s , β - 1b , α - n ##1 , α - n ##3 , and human le ##uk ##oc ##yte inter ##fer ##on α . these findings support clinical testing of approved inter ##fer ##ons for the treatment of sar ##s .  
of 193 emergency department workers exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , 9 ( 4 . 7 % ) were infected . pneumonia developed in six workers , and ass ##ays showed anti - sar ##s im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) m and i ##gg . the other three workers were i ##gm - positive and had lower i ##gg ti ##ters ; in two , mild illness developed , and one remained as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic .  
to character ##ize genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) transmitted in the beijing area during the epidemic outbreak of 2003 , we sequence ##d 29 full - length s genes of sar ##s - co ##v from 20 hospitalized sar ##s patients on our unit , the beijing 302 hospital . viral rna template ##s for the s - gene amp ##li ##fication were directly extracted from raw clinical samples , including plasma , throat sw ##ab , sp ##ut ##um , and stool , during the course of the epidemic in the beijing area . we used a ta - cl ##oning ass ##ay with direct analysis of nest ##ed reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction products in sequence . one hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine rec ##urrent variant sites were identified in analyzed s - gene sequences compared with the b ##j ##01 strain of sar ##s - co ##v . among them , eight variant sites were , we think , the first documented . our findings demonstrate the coe ##xi ##sten ##ce of s - gene sequences with and without substitution ##s ( referred to b ##j ##01 ) in samples analyzed from some patients .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in a longitudinal cross - sectional study , we determined the prevalence of virus in bodily ex ##cre ##tions and time of ser ##oco ##n ##version in discharged patients with sar ##s . con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l , throat , stool , and urine specimens were collected weekly from 64 patients and tested for sar ##s - co ##v rna by real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction ; serum samples were collected weekly and tested for sar ##s - co ##v antibody with indirect enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay . in total , 126 con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l , 124 throat sw ##ab , 116 stool , and 124 urine specimens were analyzed . five patients had positive stool samples , collected in weeks 5 – 9 . two patients ser ##oco ##n ##verted in weeks 7 and 8 ; the others were ser ##op ##osi ##tive at the first serum sample collection . in this study , 5 ( 7 . 8 % ) of 64 patients continued to shed viral rna in stool samples only , for up to week 8 of illness . most ser ##oco ##n ##version ##s occurred by week 6 of illness .  
four cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) that occurred from december 16 , 2003 , to january 8 , 2004 , in the city of guangzhou , guangdong province , china , were investigated . clinical specimens collected from these patients were tested by provincial and national laboratories in china as well as members of the world health organization sar ##s reference and verification laboratory network in a collaborative effort to identify and confirm sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . although sar ##s - co ##v was not isolated from any patient , specimens from three patients were positive for viral rna by reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay , and all patients had detect ##able rises in sar ##s - co ##v – specific antibodies . this study shows the effectiveness of a collaborative , multi ##lab ##ora ##tory response to dia ##gno ##se sar ##s .  
we developed a set of three real - time reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) ass ##ays that amp ##li ##fy three different regions of the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , can be run in parallel or in a single tube , and can detect < 10 genome equivalent ##s of sar ##s - co ##v . the ass ##ays consider all currently available sar ##s - co ##v sequences and are opt ##imi ##zed for two prominent real - time pc ##r platforms .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is thought to be transmitted primarily through dispersal of droplets , but little is known about the load of sar ##s - co ##v in oral droplets . we examined oral specimens , including throat wash and saliva , and found large amounts of sar ##s - co ##v rna in both throat wash ( 9 . 58 x 10 ( 2 ) to 5 . 93 x 10 ( 6 ) copies / ml ) and saliva ( 7 . 08 x 10 ( 3 ) to 6 . 38 x 10 ( 8 ) copies / ml ) from all specimens of 17 consecutive probable sar ##s case - patients , supporting the possibility of transmission through oral droplets . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence study showed replication of sar ##s - co ##v in the cells derived from throat wash , demonstrating the possibility of developing a convenient antigen detection ass ##ay . this finding , with the high detection rate a median of 4 days after disease onset and before the development of lung lesions in four patients , suggests that throat wash and saliva should be included in sample collection guidelines for sar ##s diagnosis .  
mu ##rine models of severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) will greatly advance research on this emerging virus . when bal ##b / c mice were simultaneously in ##oc ##ulated intra ##nas ##ally and oral ##ly , replication of sar ##s - co ##v was found in both lung and int ##estinal tissue .  
with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurring across geographic regions , data collection on the effectiveness of intervention strategies should be standardized to facilitate analysis . we propose a minimum data ##set to capture data needed to examine the basic reproduction rate , case status and criteria , symptoms , and outcomes of sar ##s .  
using three different ass ##ays , we examined 103 serum samples collected from different ci ##vet farms and a market in china in june 2003 and january 2004 . while ci ##vet ##s on farms were largely free from sar ##s - co ##v infection , ≈ ##80 % of the animals from one animal market in guangzhou contained significant levels of antibody to sar ##s - co ##v , which suggests no widespread infection among ci ##vet ##s resident on farms , and the infection of ci ##vet ##s in the market might be associated with trading activities under the conditions of over ##crow ##ding and mixing of various animal species .  
serum samples from 317 patients with patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) were tested for the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus , with sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 94 % and 78 % for the first 5 days and 6 – 10 days after onset , respectively . the specific ##ity was 99 . 9 % . n protein can be used as an early diagnostic maker for sar ##s .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in china in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control . because of a concern for re ##eme ##rgen ##ce or a deliberate release of the sar ##s corona ##virus , vaccine development was initiated . evaluation ##s of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in fe ##rret ##s and non ##hum ##an primate ##s and a virus - like - particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an im ##mun ##opa ##th ##olo ##gic - type lung disease . design : four candidate vaccines for humans with or without al ##um ad ##ju ##vant were evaluated in a mouse model of sar ##s , a v ##lp vaccine , the vaccine given to fe ##rret ##s and nh ##p , another whole virus vaccine and an rd ##na - produced s protein . bal ##b / c or c ##57 ##bl / 6 mice were va ##cci ##nated im on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56 . on day 58 , challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and his ##top ##ath ##ology . results : all vaccines induced serum neutral ##izing antibody with increasing dos ##ages and / or al ##um significantly increasing responses . significant reductions of sar ##s - co ##v two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live sar ##s - co ##v . all mice exhibited his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals va ##cci ##nated ( bal ##b / c and c ##57 ##bl / 6 ) or given live virus , influenza vaccine , or pbs suggesting infection occurred in all . his ##top ##ath ##ology seen in animals given one of the sar ##s - co ##v vaccines was uniformly a th ##2 - type im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology with prominent e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l in ##filtration , confirmed with special e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l stains . the path ##olo ##gic changes seen in all control groups lacked the e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l prominence . conclusions : these sar ##s - co ##v vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with sar ##s - co ##v . however , challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of th ##2 - type im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology suggesting hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity to sar ##s - co ##v components was induced . caution in proceeding to application of a sar ##s - co ##v vaccine in humans is indicated .  
bats are source of corona ##virus ##es closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) virus . numerous studies have been carried out to identify new bat viruses related to sar ##s - corona ##virus ( bat - sar ##s - like co ##vs ) using a reverse - transcribed - polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay . however , a qu ##ali ##tative pc ##r could under ##est ##imate the prevalence of infection , affecting the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological evaluation of bats in viral ecology . in this work an sy ##br green - real time pc ##r ass ##ay was developed for dia ##gno ##sing infection with sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es from bat gu ##ano and was applied as screening tool in a survey carried out on 45 greater horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus fe ##rr ##ume ##quin ##um ) sampled in italy in 2009 . the ass ##ay showed high sensitivity and rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility . its application on bats screening resulted in a prevalence of 42 % . this method could be suitable as screening tool in ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveys about the presence of bat - sar ##s - like co ##vs , consequently to obtain a more realistic scenario of the viral prevalence in the population .  
hundreds of million people worldwide have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , and the rate of global death from sar ##s has remarkably increased . hence , the development of efficient drug treatments for the biological effects of sar ##s is highly needed . we have previously shown that quantum dots ( q ##ds ) - con ##ju ##gated rna ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide is sensitive to the specific recognition of the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein . in this study , we found that a designed bio ##chi ##p could analyze inhibitors of the sar ##s - co ##v n protein using nano ##par ##tic ##le - based rna ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide . among the poly ##ph ##eno ##lic compounds examined , ( − ) - cat ##ech ##in gall ##ate and ( − ) - gallo ##cate ##chin gall ##ate demonstrated a remarkable inhibition activity on sar ##s - co ##v n protein . ( − ) - cat ##ech ##in gall ##ate and ( − ) - gallo ##cate ##chin gall ##ate at ##ten ##uated the binding affinity in a concentrated manner as evidenced by q ##ds - con ##ju ##gated rna ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide on a designed bio ##chi ##p . at a concentration of 0 . 05 μ ##g ml ( − ##1 ) , ( − ) - cat ##ech ##in gall ##ate and ( − ) - gallo ##cate ##chin gall ##ate showed more than 40 % inhibition activity on a nano ##par ##tic ##le - based rna ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide bio ##chi ##p system .  
ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigations showed that 2 of 4 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) identified in the winter of 2003 – 2004 were a waitress at a restaurant in guangzhou , china , that served palm ci ##vet ##s as food and a customer who ate in the restaurant a short distance from animal cages . all 6 palm ci ##vet ##s at the restaurant were positive for sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . partial spike ( s ) gene sequences of sar ##s - co ##v from the 2 patients were identical to 4 of 5 s gene viral sequences from palm ci ##vet ##s . phylogenetic analysis showed that sar ##s - co ##v from palm ci ##vet ##s in the restaurant was most closely related to animal isolate ##s . sar ##s cases at the restaurant were the result of recent inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transfer from the put ##ative palm ci ##vet reservoir , and not the result of continued circulation of sar ##s - co ##v in the human population .  
developing effective and safe vaccines is urgently needed to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine may be the first one available for clinical use because it is easy to generate ; however , safety is the main concern . the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v is the major induce ##r of neutral ##izing antibodies , and the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s ##1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conform ##ation ##al neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes . this suggests that rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins containing rb ##d and vectors encoding the rb ##d sequence can be used to develop safe and effective sar ##s vaccines .  
we conducted a study among healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) exposed to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) before infection control measures were instituted . of all exposed hc ##ws , 7 . 5 % had as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - positive cases . as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s was associated with lower sar ##s antibody ti ##ters and higher use of masks when compared to p ##ne ##um ##onic sar ##s .  
in terms of its highly pathogen ##ic nature , there remains a significant need to further define the immune pathology of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection , as well as identify co ##rre ##lates of immunity to help develop vaccines for severe corona ##vira ##l infections . here we use a sar ##s - co ##v infection - rein ##fect ##ion fe ##rret model and a functional gen ##omics approach to gain insight into sar ##s im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogen ##esis and to identify co ##rre ##lates of immune protection during sar ##s - co ##v - challenge in fe ##rret ##s previously infected with sar ##s - co ##v or im ##mun ##ized with a sar ##s virus vaccine . we identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of fe ##rret ##s associated with primary immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v infection and in fe ##rret ##s that received an identical second in ##oc ##ulum . acute sar ##s - co ##v infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by anti ##vira ##l if ##n response gene ( ir ##g ) expression . rein ##fect ##ed fe ##rret ##s , however , lacked the integrated expression of ir ##gs that was prevalent during acute infection . the expression of specific ir ##gs was also absent upon challenge in fe ##rret ##s im ##mun ##ized with an inactivated , al ( oh ) ( 3 ) - ad ##ju ##vant ##ed whole virus sar ##s vaccine candidate that protected them against sar ##s - co ##v infection in the lungs . lack of if ##n - mediated immune enhancement in infected fe ##rret ##s that were previously in ##oc ##ulated with , or va ##cci ##nated against , sar ##s - co ##v revealed 9 ir ##g co ##rre ##lates of protective immunity . this data provides insight into the molecular pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - like - co ##v infections and is an important resource for the development of co ##v anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s and vaccines .  
background : sub ##ling ##ual ( s . l . ) administration of soluble protein antigen ##s , inactivated viruses , or virus - like particles has been shown to induce broad immune responses in mu ##cos ##al and extra - mu ##cos ##al tissues . rec ##om ##bina ##nt replication - defective aden ##ov ##irus vectors ( ra ##d ##vs ) in ##fect mu ##cos ##a surface and therefore can serve as a mu ##cos ##al antigen delivery vehicle . in this study we examined whether s . l . im ##mun ##ization with ra ##d ##v encoding spike protein ( s ) ( ra ##d ##v - s ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) induce ##s protective immunity against sar ##s - co ##v and could serve as a safe mu ##cos ##al route for delivery of ra ##d ##v . results : here , we show that s . l . administration of ra ##d ##v - s induced serum sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing and air ##way i ##ga antibodies in mice . these antibody responses are comparable to those induced by intra ##nas ##al ( i . n . ) administration . in addition , s . l . im ##mun ##ization induced antigen - specific cd ##8 ( + ) t cell responses in the lungs that are superior to those induced by intra ##mus ##cular im ##mun ##ization . importantly , unlike i . n . administration , s . l . im ##mun ##ization with ra ##d ##v did not red ##ire ##ct the ra ##d ##v vector to the ol ##factory bulb . conclusion : our study indicates that s . l . im ##mun ##ization with ra ##d ##v - s is safe and effective in induction of a broad spectrum of immune responses and presumably protection against infection with sar ##s - co ##v .  
immune sera from con ##vale ##scent patients have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) making passive immune therapy with human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies an attractive treatment strategy for sar ##s . previously , using x ##eno ##mous ##e ( am ##gen british columbia inc ) , we produced a panel of neutral ##izing human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( hm ##ab ##s ) that could specifically bind to the ec ##to ##dom ##ain of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . some of the hm ##ab ##s were s ##1 domain specific , while some were not . in this study , we describe non - s ##1 binding neutral ##izing hm ##ab ##s that can specifically bind to the conserved s ##2 domain of the s protein . however , unlike the s ##1 specific hm ##ab ##s , the s ##2 specific hm ##ab ##s can neutral ##ize pseudo ##type ##d viruses expressing different s proteins containing receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolate ##s . these data indicate that hm ##ab ##s which bind to conserved regions of the s protein are more suitable for con ##fer ##ring protection against a wide range of sar ##s - co ##v variants and have implications for generating therapeutic antibodies or subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses .  
a respiratory disease caused by a novel corona ##virus , termed the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was first reported in china in late 2002 . the subsequent efficient human - to - human transmission of this virus eventually affected more than 30 countries worldwide , resulting in a mortality rate of ~ 10 % of infected individuals . the spread of the virus was ultimately controlled by isolation of infected individuals and there has been no infections reported since april 2004 . however , the natural reservoir of the virus was never identified and it is not known if this virus will re - emerge and , therefore , research on this virus continues . the sar ##s - co ##v genome is about 30 kb in length and is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . the genome en ##codes for proteins that are homo ##log ##ous to known corona ##virus proteins , such as the replica ##se proteins ( or ##fs 1a and 1b ) and the four major structural proteins : nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) and envelope ( e ) . sar ##s - co ##v also en ##codes for eight unique proteins , called accessory proteins , with no known homo ##logue ##s . this review will sum ##mar ##ize the current knowledge on sar ##s - co ##v accessory proteins and will include : ( i ) expression and processing ; ( ii ) the effects on cellular processes ; and ( iii ) functional studies .  
the corona ##vir ##idae family , an enveloped rna virus family , and , more particularly , human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) , were historically known to be responsible for a large portion of common cold ##s and other upper respiratory tract infections . hc ##ov are now known to be involved in more serious respiratory diseases , i . e . bro ##nch ##itis , bro ##nch ##iol ##itis or pneumonia , especially in young children and neon ##ates , elderly people and im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed patients . they have also been involved in nos ##oco ##mia ##l viral infections . in 2002 – 2003 , the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , due to a newly discovered corona ##virus , the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ; led to a new awareness of the medical importance of the corona ##vir ##idae family . this pathogen , responsible for an emerging disease in humans , with high risk of fatal outcome ; under ##line the pressing need for new approaches to the management of the infection , and primarily to its prevention . another interesting feature of corona ##virus ##es is their potential environmental resistance , despite the accepted fra ##gil ##ity of enveloped viruses . indeed , several studies have described the ability of hc ##ov ##s ( i . e . hc ##ov 229 ##e , hc ##ov o ##c ##43 ( also known as beta ##cor ##ona ##virus 1 ) , nl ##6 ##3 , hk ##u ##1 or sar ##s - co ##v ) to survive in different environmental conditions ( e . g . temperature and humidity ) , on different supports found in hospital settings such as aluminum , sterile sponge ##s or late ##x surgical gloves or in biological fluids . finally , taking into account the persist ##ing lack of specific anti ##vira ##l treatments ( there is , in fact , no specific treatment available to fight corona ##virus ##es infections ) , the corona ##vir ##idae specific ##ities ( i . e . pathogen ##ici ##ty , potential environmental resistance ) make them a challenging model for the development of efficient means of prevention , as an adapted anti ##se ##psis - di ##sin ##fect ##ion , to prevent the environmental spread of such in ##fect ##ive agents . this review will sum ##mar ##ize current knowledge on the capacity of human corona ##virus ##es to survive in the environment and the efficacy of well - known anti ##se ##ptic - di ##sin ##fect ##ants against them , with particular focus on the development of new method ##ologies to evaluate the activity of new anti ##se ##ptic - di ##sin ##fect ##ants on viruses .  
a new human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) has emerged very recently in the middle east . the clinical presentation resembled that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) as encountered during the epidemic in 2002 / 2003 . in both cases , acute renal failure was observed in humans . hc ##ov - em ##c is a member of the same virus genus as sar ##s - co ##v but constitutes a sister species . here we investigated whether it might utilize ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the sar ##s - co ##v receptor . knowledge of the receptor is highly critical because the restriction of the sar ##s receptor to deep compartments of the human respiratory tract limited the spread of sar ##s . in baby ham ##ster kidney ( b ##h ##k ) cells , lent ##iv ##ira ##l trans ##duction of human ace ##2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) conferred per ##missive ##ness and replication for sar ##s - co ##v but not for hc ##ov - em ##c . monkey and human kidney cells ( llc - mk ##2 , ve ##ro , and 76 ##9 - p ) and sw ##ine kidney cells were per ##missive for both viruses , but only sar ##s - co ##v infection could be blocked by anti - ha ##ce ##2 antibody and could be neutral ##ized by pre ##in ##cu ##bation of virus with soluble ace ##2 . our data show that ace ##2 is neither necessary nor sufficient for hc ##ov - em ##c replication . moreover , hc ##ov - em ##c , but not sar ##s - co ##v , replicate ##d in cell lines from rouse ##tt ##us , rhino ##lo ##phus , pip ##ist ##rell ##us , my ##ot ##is , and carol ##lia bats , representing four major chi ##rop ##tera ##n families from both sub ##ord ##ers . as human co ##v normally cannot replicate in bat cells from different families , this suggests that hc ##ov - em ##c might use a receptor molecule that is conserved in bats , pigs , and humans , imp ##lica ##ting a low barrier against cross - host transmission .  
a newly identified beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , human corona ##virus em ##c ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) , has been isolated from several patients with respiratory and renal disease in the middle east . while only a few infected patients have been identified , the mortality of the infection is greater than 50 % . like its better - known cousin severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , hc ##ov - em ##c appears to have originated from bats . in a recent article in mb ##io , muller et al . described several important differences between the two viruses [ m . a . muller et al . , mb ##io 3 ( 6 ) : e ##00 ##51 ##5 - 12 , 2012 , doi : 10 . 112 ##8 / mb ##io . 00 ##51 ##5 - 12 ] . unlike sar ##s - co ##v , hc ##ov - em ##c can directly in ##fect bat cells . as important , hc ##ov - em ##c does not enter cells using the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting receptor - 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) . these results provide a strong incentive for identifying the host cell receptor used by hc ##ov - em ##c . identification of the receptor will provide insight into the pathogen ##esis of pulmonary and renal disease and may also suggest novel therapeutic interventions .  
a subunit vaccine , rb ##d - s , is under development to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which is classified by the us ni ##h as a category c pathogen . this vaccine is comprised of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein and formulated on al ##um , together with a synthetic g ##lu ##co ##py ##rano ##sy ##l lip ##id a . the vaccine would induce neutral ##izing antibodies without causing th ##2 - type im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . vaccine development is being led by the nonprofit product development partnership ; sa ##bin vaccine institute and texas children ’ s hospital center for vaccine development in collaboration with two academic partners ( the new york blood center and university of texas medical branch ) ; an industrial partner ( immune design corporation ) ; and walter reed army institute of research . a road ##ma ##p for the product development of the rb ##d - s sar ##s vaccine is outlined with a goal to manufacture the vaccine for clinical testing within the next 5 years .  
summary : in september 2012 , a novel corona ##virus was isolated from a patient in saudi arabia who had died of an acute respiratory illness and renal failure . the clinical presentation was reminiscent of the outbreak caused by the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) exactly ten years ago that resulted in over 800 ##0 cases . sequence analysis of the new virus revealed that it was indeed a member of the same genus as sar ##s - co ##v . by mid - february 2013 , 12 laboratory - confirmed cases had been reported with 6 fatalities . the first 9 cases were in individuals resident in the middle east , while the most recent 3 cases were in family members resident in the uk . the index case in the uk family cluster had travel history to pakistan and saudi arabia . although the current evidence suggests that this virus is not highly trans ##missible among humans , there is a real danger that it may spread to other parts of the world . here , a brief review of the events is provided to sum ##mar ##ize the rapidly emerging picture of this new virus .  
a number of emerging and re - emerging viruses have caused epidemic ##s or pan ##de ##mics of infectious diseases leading to major devastation ##s throughout human history . therefore , developing effective and safe vaccines against these viruses is clearly important for the protection of at - risk populations . our previous studies have shown that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a key target for the development of sar ##s vaccines . in this review , we highlight some key advances in the development of anti ##vira ##l vaccines targeting the rb ##ds of spike proteins of emerging and re - emerging viruses , using sar ##s - co ##v , influenza virus , hen ##dra virus ( he ##v ) and ni ##pa ##h virus ( ni ##v ) as examples .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic started in late 2002 and swiftly spread across 5 continents with a mortality rate of around 10 % . although the epidemic was eventually controlled through the implementation of strict qu ##aran ##tine measures , there continues a need to investigate the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and develop interventions should it re - emerge . numerous studies have shown that neutral ##izing antibodies against the virus can be found in patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v within days upon the onset of illness and lasting up to several months . in contrast , there is little data on the kinetic ##s of t cell responses during sar ##s - co ##v infection and little is known about their role in the recovery process . however , recent studies in mice suggest the importance of t cells in viral clearance during sar ##s - co ##v infection . moreover , a growing number of studies have investigated the memory t cell responses in recovered sar ##s patients . this review covers the available literature on the emerging importance of t cell responses in sar ##s - co ##v infection , particularly on the mapping of cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ( ct ##l ) ep ##ito ##pes , longevity , poly ##fu ##nction ##ality and human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) association as well as their potential implications on treatment and vaccine development .  
an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) led to the identification of an associated corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . this virus evade ##s the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non - structural protein ( ns ##p ) 1 , which inhibit ##s both host gene expression and virus - and inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - dependent signaling . thus , ns ##p ##1 is a promising target for drugs , as inhibition of ns ##p ##1 would make sar ##s - co ##v more susceptible to the host anti ##vira ##l defenses . to gain a better understanding of ns ##p ##1 mode of action , we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein . from this work , we identified six classes of mutants that abolished , at ##ten ##uated or increased ns ##p ##1 inhibition of host gene expression and / or anti ##vira ##l signaling . each class of mutants clustered on sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 surface and suggested ns ##p ##1 interact ##s with distinct host factors to ex ##ert its inhibitor ##y activities . identification of the ns ##p ##1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting ns ##p ##1 . significantly , several point mutants increased the inhibitor ##y activity of ns ##p ##1 , suggesting that corona ##virus ##es could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues .  
a novel human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) was recently identified in the middle east as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) resembling the illness caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . although derived from the co ##v family , the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor . here , we investigated whether hc ##ov - em ##c and sar ##s - co ##v induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung ep ##ith ##elial cell line . hc ##ov - em ##c was able to replicate as efficiently as sar ##s - co ##v in cal ##u - 3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcript ##omic changes before 12 h post ##in ##fect ##ion . later in infection , hc ##ov - em ##c induced a massive d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of the host transcript ##ome , to a much greater extent than sar ##s - co ##v . both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the inter ##le ##uki ##n 17 ( il - 17 ) pathway , but hc ##ov - em ##c specifically down - regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway , including both type i and ii major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex ( m ##hc ) genes . this could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response . a unique set of 207 genes was d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated early and permanently throughout infection with hc ##ov - em ##c , and was used in a computational screen to predict potential anti ##vira ##l compounds , including kinase inhibitors and g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids . overall , hc ##ov - em ##c and sar ##s - co ##v eli ##cit distinct host gene expression responses , which might impact in vivo pathogen ##esis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emerge ##nt virus .  
in 2012 a novel corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v , associated with severe respiratory disease emerged in the arabian peninsula . to date , 55 human cases have been reported , including 31 fatal cases . several of the cases were likely a result of human - to - human transmission . the emergence of this novel corona ##virus prompt ##s the need for a small animal model to study the pathogen ##esis of this virus and to test the efficacy of potential intervention strategies . in this study we explored the use of syrian ham ##sters as a small animal disease model , using intra ##tra ##che ##al in ##oc ##ulation and in ##oc ##ulation via aero ##sol . clinical signs of disease , virus replication , his ##to ##logical lesions , cy ##tok ##ine up ##re ##gul ##ation nor ser ##oco ##n ##version were observed in any of the in ##oc ##ulated animals , indicating that mer ##s - co ##v does not replicate in syrian ham ##sters .  
background : a novel corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causing severe , life - threatening respiratory disease has emerged in the middle east at a time when two international mass gatherings in saudi arabia are imminent . while mer ##s - co ##v has already spread to and within other countries , these mass gatherings could further amp ##li ##fy and / or accelerate its international dissemination , especially since the origins and geographic source of the virus remain poorly understood . methods : we analyzed 2012 worldwide flight it ##iner ##ary data and historic ha ##j ##j pilgrim data to predict population movements out of saudi arabia and the broader middle east to help cities and countries assess their potential for mer ##s - co ##v import ##ation . we compared the magnitude of travel to countries with their world bank economic status and per capita healthcare expenditures as sur ##rogate markers of their capacity for timely detection of imported mer ##s - co ##v and their ability to mount an effective public health response . results : 16 . 8 million travelers flew on commercial flights out of saudi arabia , jordan , qatar , and the united arab emirates between june and november 2012 , of which 51 . 6 % were destined for india ( 16 . 3 % ) , egypt ( 10 . 4 % ) , pakistan ( 7 . 8 % ) , the united kingdom ( 4 . 3 % ) , kuwait ( 3 . 6 % ) , bangladesh ( 3 . 1 % ) , iran ( 3 . 1 % ) and bahrain ( 2 . 9 % ) . among the 1 . 74 million foreign pilgrims who performed the ha ##j ##j last year , an estimated 65 . 1 % originated from low and lower - middle income countries . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v is an emerging pathogen with pan ##de ##mic potential with its apparent epic ##enter in saudi arabia , where millions of pilgrims will imminent ##ly cong ##re ##gate for two international mass gatherings . understanding global population movements out of the middle east through the end of this year ' s ha ##j ##j could help direct anti ##ci ##pa ##tory mer ##s - co ##v surveillance and public health prepared ##ness to mit ##igate its potential global health and economic impacts .  
the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) of recently identified middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) targets the cellular receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . sequence comparison and modeling analysis have revealed a put ##ative receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) on the viral spike , which media ##tes this interaction . we report the 3 . 0 a - resolution crystal structure of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d bound to the extra ##cellular domain of human d ##pp ##4 . our results show that mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d consists of a core and a receptor - binding sub ##dom ##ain . the receptor - binding sub ##dom ##ain interact ##s with d ##pp ##4 β - propeller but not its intrinsic hydro ##lase domain . mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d and related sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d share a high degree of structural similarity in their core sub ##dom ##ains , but are notably diver ##gent in the receptor - binding sub ##dom ##ain . mu ##tage ##nes ##is studies have identified several key residues in the receptor - binding sub ##dom ##ain that are critical for viral binding to d ##pp ##4 and entry into the target cell . the atomic details at the interface between mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d and d ##pp ##4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction , which can guide development of therapeutic ##s and vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
no therapeutic ##s or vaccines currently exist for human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) . the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) epidemic in 2002 – 2003 , and the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in april 2012 , emphasize the high probability of future zoo ##not ##ic hc ##ov emergence causing severe and lethal human disease . additionally , the resistance of sar ##s - co ##v to rib ##avi ##rin ( rb ##v ) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of co ##v replication . co ##vs express a 3 ′ - to - 5 ′ ex ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se in non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 14 ( ns ##p ##14 - ex ##on ) that is required for high - fidelity replication and is conserved across the co ##v family . all genetic and bio ##chemical data support the hypothesis that ns ##p ##14 - ex ##on has an rna proof ##rea ##ding function . thus , we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that ex ##on is responsible for co ##v resistance to rna mu ##tage ##ns . we demonstrate that while wild - type ( ex ##on + ) co ##vs were resistant to rb ##v and 5 - flu ##oro ##ura ##ci ##l ( 5 - fu ) , co ##vs lacking ex ##on activity ( ex ##on ##− ) were up to 300 - fold more sensitive . while the primary anti ##vira ##l activity of rb ##v against co ##vs was not mu ##tage ##nes ##is , ex ##on ##− co ##vs treated with 5 - fu demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi - cycle replication , as well as decreased specific in ##fect ##ivity , consistent with 5 - fu functioning as a mu ##tage ##n . comparison of full - genome next - generation sequencing of 5 - fu treated sar ##s - co ##v populations revealed a 16 - fold increase in the number of mutations within the ex ##on ##− population as compared to ex ##on + . ninety percent of these mutations represented a : g and u : c transitions , consistent with 5 - fu incorporation during rna synthesis . together our results constitute direct evidence that co ##v ex ##on activity provides a critical proof ##rea ##ding function during virus replication . furthermore , these studies identify ex ##on as the first viral protein distinct from the rd ##rp that determines the sensitivity of rna viruses to mu ##tage ##ns . finally , our results show the importance of ex ##on as a target for inhibition , and suggest that small - molecule inhibitors of ex ##on activity could be potential pan - co ##v therapeutic ##s in combination with rb ##v or rna mu ##tage ##ns .  
systems biology offers considerable promise in uncover ##ing novel pathways by which viruses and other micro ##bial pathogen ##s interact with host signaling and expression networks to media ##te disease severity . in this study , we have developed an un ##bia ##sed modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections media ##ting acute lung injury , using severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) as a model pathogen . we utilized a time course of matched vi ##rol ##og ##ic , path ##ological , and transcript ##omic data within a novel method ##ological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes . this un ##bia ##sed approach produced a high - priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3 , 500 genes that were differential ##ly expressed following sar ##s - co ##v infection . with these data , we predicted that the ur ##oki ##nas ##e and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sub ##let ##hal disease following sar ##s - co ##v infection in mice . we valid ##ated the importance of the ur ##oki ##nas ##e pathway for sar ##s - co ##v disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice , pro ##te ##omic co ##rre ##lates of pathway activation , and path ##ological disease severity . the results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coa ##gul ##ation and fi ##bri ##no ##ly ##sin pathways regulating path ##ological disease outcomes , including diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage and acute lung injury , following infection with highly pathogen ##ic respiratory viruses , such as sar ##s - co ##v .  
ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic , a second corona ##virus , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the middle east and in travelers from this region . over the past 9 months , since the virus was first isolated , much has been learned about the biology of the virus . it is now clear that mer ##s - co ##v is trans ##missible from person to person , and its close relationship with several bat corona ##virus ##es suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection . however , many key issues need to be addressed , including identification of the pro ##xi ##mate , presumably zoo ##not ##ic , source of the infection , the prevalence of the infection in human populations , details regarding clinical and path ##ological features of the human infection , the establishment of a small rode ##nt model for the infection , and the vi ##rol ##ogical and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients . most importantly , we do not know whether a mer ##s - co ##v epidemic is likely or not . infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths ( as of 29 july 2013 ) , but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials , including margaret chan , director - general of the world health organization , who called mer ##s - co ##v “ a threat to the entire world . ” this article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered .  
corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enter ##ic disease in humans and animals . the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) highlighted the potentially lethal consequences of co ##v - induced disease in humans . in 2012 , a novel co ##v ( middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ; mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged , causing 49 human cases thus far , of which 23 had a fatal outcome . in this study , we characterized mer ##s - co ##v replication and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city in human and monkey cell lines . electron microscopy of infected ve ##ro cells revealed extensive membrane rear ##rang ##ement ##s , including the formation of double - membrane ve ##sic ##les and con ##vo ##lu ##ted membranes , which have been implicated previously in the rna synthesis of sar ##s - co ##v and other co ##vs . following infection , we observed rapidly increasing viral rna synthesis and release of high ti ##tres of infectious pro ##geny , followed by a pronounced cy ##top ##ath ##ology . these characteristics were used to develop an ass ##ay for anti ##vira ##l compound screening in 96 - well format , which was used to identify cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a as an inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v replication in cell culture . furthermore , mer ##s - co ##v was found to be 50 – 100 times more sensitive to alpha inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - α ) treatment than sar ##s - co ##v , an observation that may have important implications for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients . mer ##s - co ##v infection did not prevent the if ##n - induced nuclear trans ##lo ##cation of ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated stat ##1 , in contrast to infection with sar ##s - co ##v where this block inhibit ##s the expression of anti ##vira ##l genes . these findings highlight relevant differences between these distant ##ly related zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs in terms of their interaction with and eva ##sion of the cellular innate immune response .  
bats ( chi ##rop ##tera ) host major human pathogen ##ic viruses including corona - , para ##my ##x ##o , r ##hab ##do - and fi ##lov ##irus ##es . we analyzed six different cell lines from either yin ##pt ##ero ##chi ##rop ##tera ( including african flying foxes and a rhino ##lo ##phi ##d bat ) or yang ##och ##iro ##pt ##era ( genera carol ##lia and tad ##ari ##da ) for su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection by different enveloped rna viruses . none of the cells were sensitive to infection by trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus ( t ##ge ##v ) , a por ##cine corona ##virus , or to infection mediated by the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) incorporated into pseudo ##type ##s based on ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) . the resistance to infection was overcome if cells were trans ##fect ##ed to express the respective cellular receptor , por ##cine amino ##pe ##pt ##ida ##se n for t ##ge ##v or ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 for sar ##s - co ##v . vs ##v pseudo ##type ##s containing the s proteins of two bat sar ##s - related co ##v ( b ##g ##0 ##8 and r ##p ##3 ) were unable to in ##fect any of the six tested bat cell lines . by contrast , viral pseudo ##type ##s containing the surface protein gp of mar ##burg virus from the family fi ##lov ##iri ##dae infected all six cell lines though at different efficiency . notably , all cells were sensitive to infection by two para ##my ##x ##ov ##irus ##es ( send ##ai virus and bo ##vine respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus ) and three influenza viruses from different sub ##type ##s . these results indicate that bat cells are more resistant to infection by corona ##virus ##es than to infection by para ##my ##x ##ov ##irus ##es , fi ##lov ##irus ##es and influenza viruses . furthermore , these results show a receptor - dependent restriction of the infection of bat cells by co ##v . the implications for the isolation of corona ##virus ##es from bats are discussed .  
background : evidence points to the emergence of a novel human corona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like disease . in response , the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic ##s remains a clinical priority . to accomplish this , it is necessary to evaluate neutral ##izing antibodies and screen for mer ##s - co ##v entry inhibitors . methods : in this study , we produced a pseudo ##virus bearing the full - length spike ( s ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v in the en ##v - defective , lucifer ##ase - expressing hiv - 1 backbone . we then established a pseudo ##virus - based inhibition ass ##ay to detect neutral ##izing antibodies and anti - mer ##s - co ##v entry inhibitors . results : our results demonstrated that the generated mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus allows for single - cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , the confirmed receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . consistent with the results from a live mer ##s - co ##v - based inhibition ass ##ay , the anti ##ser ##a of mice va ##cci ##nated with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein containing receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d , residues 37 ##7 – 66 ##2 ) of mer ##s - co ##v s fused with fc of human i ##gg exhibited neutral ##izing antibody response against infection of mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus . furthermore , one small molecule hiv entry inhibitor targeting gp ##41 ( ads - j ##1 ) and the 3 - hydro ##xy ##ph ##thal ##ic an ##hy ##dr ##ide - modified human serum album ##in ( hp - hs ##a ) could significantly inhibit mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus infection . conclusion : taken together , the established mer ##s - co ##v inhibition ass ##ay is a safe and convenient pseudo ##virus - based alternative to bs ##l - 3 live - virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen mer ##s - co ##v entry inhibitors , as well as evaluate vaccine - induced neutral ##izing antibodies against the highly pathogen ##ic mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging corona ##virus in ##fect ##ing humans that is associated with acute pneumonia , occasional renal failure , and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health . the construction of a full - length infectious cd ##na clone of the mer ##s - co ##v genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here , providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop at ##ten ##uated viruses as vaccine candidates . following trans ##fect ##ion with the cd ##na clone , infectious virus was rescued in both ve ##ro a ##66 and huh - 7 cells . rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##vs ( rm ##ers - co ##vs ) lacking the accessory genes 3 , 4a , 4 ##b , and 5 were successfully rescued from cd ##na clones with these genes deleted . the mutant viruses presented growth kinetic ##s similar to those of the wild - type virus , indicating that accessory genes were not essential for mer ##s - co ##v replication in cell cultures . in contrast , an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural e protein ( rm ##ers - co ##v - δ ##e ) was not successfully rescued , since viral in ##fect ##ivity was lost at early passages . interesting ##ly , the rm ##ers - co ##v - δ ##e genome replicate ##d after cd ##na clone was trans ##fect ##ed into cells . the infectious virus was rescued and prop ##aga ##ted in cells expressing the e protein in trans , indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective . therefore , the rm ##ers - co ##v - δ ##e mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection . importance since the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v in the arabian peninsula during the summer of 2012 , it has already spread to 10 different countries , in ##fect ##ing around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50 % . this article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for mer ##s - co ##v , based on the construction of an infectious cd ##na clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome . using this system , a collection of rm ##ers - co ##v del ##eti ##on mutants has been generated . interesting ##ly , one of the mutants with the e gene deleted was a replication - competent , propagation - defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing e protein in trans , whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo . this virus constitutes a vaccine candidate that may represent a balance between safety and efficacy for the induction of mu ##cos ##al immunity , which is needed to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection . 
little is known about the biology of the emerging human group c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . because corona ##virus spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( s ) media ##te virus entry , affect viral host range , and eli ##cit neutral ##izing antibodies , analyzing the functions of mer ##s - co ##v s protein is a high research priority . mer ##s - co ##v s on lent ##iv ##irus pseudo ##vir ##ions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from new world ep ##tes ##icus fu ##scu ##s bats . surprisingly , a poly ##cl ##onal antibody to the s protein of m ##h ##v , a group a mu ##rine beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , cross - reacted in im ##mun ##ob ##lot ##s with the s ##2 domain of group c mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . mer ##s pseudo ##vir ##ions released from 293 ##t cells contained only uncle ##ave ##d s , and pseudo ##virus entry was blocked by l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic re ##age ##nts nh ( 4 ) cl and ba ##fi ##lom ##y ##cin and inhibitors of cat ##he ##ps ##in l . however , when mer ##s pseudo ##vir ##ions with uncle ##ave ##d s protein were ads ##or ##bed at 4 ##° ##c to ve ##ro e ##6 cells , brief try ##ps ##in treatment at neutral ph triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and sync ##yt ##ia formation . when 293 ##t cells producing mer ##s pseudo ##type ##s co - expressed ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses t ##mp ##rs ##s - 2 or - 4 , large sync ##yt ##ia formed at neutral ph , and the pseudo ##vir ##ions produced were non - infectious and def ##icient in s protein . these experiments show that if s protein on mer ##s pseudo ##vir ##ions is uncle ##ave ##d , then viruses enter by end ##oc ##yt ##osis in a cat ##he ##ps ##in l - dependent manner , but if mer ##s - co ##v s is cl ##ea ##ved , either during virus mat ##uration by ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses or on pseudo ##vir ##ions by try ##ps ##in in extra ##cellular fluids , then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral ph and cause massive sync ##yt ##ia formation even in cells that express little or no mer ##s - co ##v receptor . thus , whether mer ##s - co ##v enters cells within end ##oso ##mes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue , and is determined by the location of host pro ##tea ##ses that cl ##ea ##ve the viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and activate membrane fusion .  
a novel corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v ( nc ##ov , hc ##ov - em ##c / 2012 ) , originating from the middle - east , has been discovered . incoming data reveal that the virus is highly vi ##ru ##lent to humans . a model that cat ##ego ##rize ##s corona ##vius ##es according to the hardness of their shells was developed before the discovery of mer ##s - co ##v . using protein intrinsic disorder prediction , corona ##virus ##es were categorized into three groups that can be linked to the levels of oral - fe ##cal and respiratory transmission regardless of genetic proximity . using this model , mer ##s - co ##v is placed into disorder group c , which consists of corona ##virus ##es that have relatively hard inner and outer shells . the members of this group are likely to persist in the environment for a longer period of time and possess the highest oral - fe ##cal components but relatively low respiratory transmission components . oral - urine and saliva transmission are also highly possible since both require harder protective shells . results show that disorder prediction can be used as a tool that suggests clues to look for in further ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations .  
we used a lent ##iv ##ira ##l vector bearing the viral spike protein to detect neutral ##izing antibodies against middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in persons from the eastern province of saudi arabia . none of the 268 samples tested displayed neutral ##izing activity , which suggests that mer ##s - co ##v infections in humans are in ##fr ##e ##quent in this province .  
an emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . it was first reported in 2012 in saudi arabia and has now spread to eight countries . development of effective therapeutic ##s and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of mer ##s - co ##v . here , we show that a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein containing a 212 - amino acid fragment ( residues 37 ##7 - 58 ##8 ) in the truncated receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d : residues 36 ##7 – 60 ##6 ) of mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein fused with human i ##gg fc fragment ( s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc ) is highly expressed in the culture super ##nat ##ant of trans ##fect ##ed 293 ##t cells . the pu ##rified s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc protein efficiently binds to dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , the receptor of mer ##s - co ##v , and potent ##ly inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v infection , suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic mod ##ality for treating mer ##s - co ##v infection and saving the patients ’ lives . the rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc is able to induce in the va ##cci ##nated mice strong mer ##s - co ##v s - specific antibodies , which blocks the binding of rb ##d to d ##pp ##4 receptor and effectively neutral ##izes mer ##s - co ##v infection . these findings indicate that this truncated rb ##d protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) that first appeared in saudi arabia during the summer of 2012 has to date ( 20th september 2013 ) caused 58 human deaths . mer ##s - co ##v utilizes the dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) host cell receptor , and analysis of the long - term interaction between virus and receptor provides key information on the evolutionary events that lead to the viral emergence . findings : we show that bat d ##pp ##4 genes have been subject to significant adaptive evolution , suggest ##ive of a long - term arms - race between bats and mer ##s related co ##vs . in particular , we identify three positively selected residues in d ##pp ##4 that directly interact with the viral surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . conclusions : our study suggests that the evolutionary lineage leading to mer ##s - co ##v may have circulated in bats for a substantial time period .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in the eastern mediterranean and imported cases to europe has alerted public health authorities . currently , detection of mer ##s - co ##v in patient samples is done by real - time rt - pc ##r . samples collected from suspected cases are sent to highly - equipped centralized laboratories for screening . a rapid point - of - care test is needed to allow more widespread mobile detection of the virus directly from patient material . in this study , we describe the development of a reverse transcription iso ##thermal rec ##om ##bina ##se polymer ##ase amp ##li ##fication ( rt - r ##pa ) ass ##ay for the identification of mer ##s - co ##v . a partial nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene rna molecular standard of mer ##s - corona ##virus was used to determine the ass ##ay sensitivity . the iso ##thermal ( 42 ##° ##c ) mer ##s - co ##v rt - r ##pa was as sensitive as real - time rt - pc ##r ( 10 rna molecules ) , rapid ( 3 - 7 minutes ) and mobile ( using tubes ##can ##ner weighing 1 ##k ##g ) . the mer ##s - co ##v rt - r ##pa showed cross - detection neither of any of the rna ##s of several corona ##virus ##es and respiratory viruses affecting humans nor of the human genome . the developed iso ##thermal real - time rt - r ##pa is ideal for rapid mobile molecular mer ##s - co ##v monitoring in acute patients and may also facilitate the search for the animal reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes symptoms similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , yet involving an additional component of acute renal failure ( ar ##f ) according to several published case reports . impairment of the kidney is not typically seen in corona ##virus infections . the role of kidney infection in mer ##s is not understood . findings : a systematic review of communicated and peer - reviewed case reports revealed differences in descriptions of kidney involvement in mer ##s versus sar ##s patients . in particular , ar ##f in mer ##s patients occurred considerably earlier after a median time to onset of 11 days ( sd ± ##2 , 0 days ) as opposed to 20 days for sar ##s , according to the literature . in - situ his ##to ##logical stain ##ing of the respective cellular receptors for mer ##s - and sar ##s - corona ##virus showed highly similar stain ##ing patterns with a focus of a receptor - specific signal in kidney ep ##ith ##elial cells . comparative infection experiments with sar ##s - and mer ##s - co ##v in primary human kidney cells versus primary human bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells showed cy ##top ##ath ##ogenic infection only in kidney cells , and only if infected with mer ##s - co ##v . kidney ep ##ith ##elial cells produced almost 1000 - fold more infectious mer ##s - co ##v pro ##geny than bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells , while only a small difference was seen between cell types when infected with sar ##s - co ##v . conclusion : ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies should analyze kidney impairment and its characteristics in mer ##s - co ##v . virus replication in the kidney with potential shed ##ding in urine might constitute a way of transmission , and could explain un ##tra ##cea ##ble transmission chains leading to new cases . individual patients might benefit from early induction of reno ##pro ##tec ##tive treatment .  
from september 2012 to july 2013 , 81 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , including 45 deaths ( a case fatal ##ity ratio of 55 % ) have been reported from eight countries . human - to - human transmission is now confirmed showing potential for another pan ##de ##mic of zoo ##not ##ic disease , with an extremely high mortality rate . effective surveillance strategies are required in countries with a high influx of migrants from the middle east to mit ##igate the probable import ##ation of mer ##s - co ##v . we discuss here the risk of mer ##s - co ##v in major labor sending countries and list the probable strategies for control and prevention of mer ##s - co ##v using sri lanka as an example . it is conservative ##ly estimated that 10 % of sri lanka ’ s population work as international labor migrants ( 1 . 8 to 2 million workers ) , with 93 % residing in the middle east . an average of 720 workers depart each day , with the majority of these workers ( 71 % ) departing to the kingdom of saudi arabia ( the country with 81 . 5 % of total mer ##s - co ##v cases ) . we also describe other in ##bound migration categories such as tourists and resident visa holders relevant to the context of prepared ##ness and planning . the importance of partnerships between public health authorities at national and regional levels with labor migration networks to establish institutional and / or policy mechanisms are highlighted for ensuring effective prepared ##ness and response planning . strategies that can be taken by public health authorities working in both labor sending and labor receiving counties are also described . the strategies described here may be useful for other labor sending country contexts in asia with a high frequency and volume of migrant workers to and from the gulf region .  
replica ##tive capacity of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was assessed in cell lines derived from livestock and per ##ido ##mes ##tic small mammals on the arabian peninsula . only cell lines originating from goats and camel ##s showed efficient replication of mer ##s - co ##v . these results provide direction in the search for the intermediate host of mer ##s - co ##v .  
one year after the occurrence of the first case of infection by the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) there is no clear consensus on the best treatment to propose . the world health organization , as well as several other national agencies , are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in mer ##s - co ##v infection . we compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with mer ##s - co ##v to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches . bro ##nch ##o - al ##ve ##olar lava ##ge ( bal ) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study . quantitative polymer ##ase chain reaction ( q ##rt ##pc ##r ) was performed after extraction of rna from bal cells of mer ##s - co ##v infected patients and control patients . bal super ##nat ##ants and sera were used to assess cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es secret ##ion by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . the first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit , the second patient still recover ##s from infection . the patient with a poor outcome ( patient 1 ) , compared to patient 2 , did not promote type - 1 inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , and particularly if ##n ##α , in response to double stranded rna ( ds ##rna ) from mer ##s - co ##v . the absence of if ##n ##α , known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses , imp ##air ##s the development of a robust anti ##vira ##l adaptive th - 1 immune response . this response is mediated by il - 12 and if ##n ##γ that decreases viral clearance ; levels of both of these media ##tors were decreased in patient 1 . finally , we confirm previous in vitro findings that mer ##s - co ##v can drive il - 17 production in humans . host recognition of viral ds ##rna determines outcome in the early stage of mer ##s - co ##v infection . we highlight the critical role of if ##n ##α in this initial stage to orchestra ##te a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early if ##n ##α treatment during mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is associated with severe disease , human corona ##virus hk ##u ##1 ( hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 ) commonly ci ##rc ##ulates in the human populations causing generally mild ##er illness . spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v activate ##s the unfolded protein response ( up ##r ) . it is not understood whether hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 s protein has similar activity . in addition , the up ##r - act ##ivating domain in sar ##s - co ##v s protein remains to be identified . results : in this study we compared s proteins of sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 for their ability to activate the up ##r . both s proteins were found in the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum . trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cat ##aly ##zed the cleavage of sar ##s - co ##v s protein , but not the counterpart in hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 . both s proteins showed a similar pattern of up ##r - act ##ivating activity . through per ##k kinase they activated the transcription of up ##r effect ##or genes such as gr ##p ##7 ##8 , gr ##p ##9 ##4 and chop . n - linked g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion was not required for the activation of the up ##r by s proteins . s ##1 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v but not its counterpart in hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 was capable of act ##ivating the up ##r . a central region ( amino acids 201 – 400 ) of sar ##s - co ##v s ##1 was required for this activity . conclusions : sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 s proteins use distinct up ##r - act ##ivating domains to ex ##ert the same mod ##ulator ##y effects on up ##r signaling .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first documented in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) in 2012 and , to date , has been identified in 180 cases with 43 % mortality . in this study , we have determined the mer ##s - co ##v evolutionary rate , documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the arabian peninsula , and identified the genome positions under positive selection , important features for monitoring adaptation of mer ##s - co ##v to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections . respiratory samples from confirmed ks ##a mer ##s cases from may to september 2013 were subjected to whole - genome deep sequencing , and 32 complete or partial sequences ( 20 were ≥ ##9 ##9 % complete , 7 were 50 to 94 % complete , and 5 were 27 to 50 % complete ) were obtained , bringing the total available mer ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequences to 65 . an evolutionary rate of 1 . 12 × 10 ( − ##3 ) substitution ##s per site per year ( 95 % credible interval [ 95 % ci ] , 8 . 76 × 10 ( − ##4 ) ; 1 . 37 × 10 ( − ##3 ) ) was estimated , bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to march 2012 ( 95 % ci , december 2011 ; june 2012 ) . only one mer ##s - co ##v cod ##on , spike 102 ##0 , located in a domain required for cell entry , is under strong positive selection . four ks ##a mer ##s - co ##v phylogenetic clade ##s were found , with 3 clade ##s apparently no longer contributing to current cases . the size of the population infected with mer ##s - co ##v showed a gradual increase to june 2013 , followed by a decline , possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number ( r ( 0 ) ) for the virus that is less than 1 .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused an ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory tract infection in humans in the arabian peninsula since 2012 . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been implicated as possible viral reservoirs . we used ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays to analyze 65 ##1 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel serum samples from the united arab emirates ; 151 of 65 ##1 samples were obtained in 2003 , well before onset of the current epidemic , and 500 serum samples were obtained in 2013 . rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike protein – specific im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and virus neutral ##ization tests enabled clear discrimination between mer ##s - co ##v and bo ##vine co ##v infections . most ( 63 ##2 / 65 ##1 , 97 . 1 % ) camel ##s had antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v . this result included all 151 serum samples obtained in 2003 . most ( 38 ##9 / 65 ##1 , 59 . 8 % ) serum samples had mer ##s - co ##v – neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters > 1 , 280 . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from the united arab emirates were infected at high rates with mer ##s - co ##v or a closely related , probably con ##sp ##ec ##ific , virus long before the first human mer ##s cases .  
on march 19 , 2013 , a patient from united arab emirates who had severe respiratory infection was transferred to a hospital in germany , 11 days after sy ##mpt ##om onset . infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was suspected on march 21 and confirmed on march 23 ; the patient , who had contact with an ill camel shortly before sy ##mpt ##om onset , died on march 26 . a contact investigation was initiated to identify possible person - to - person transmission and assess infection control measures . of 83 identified contacts , 81 were available for follow - up . ten contacts experienced mild symptoms , but test results for respiratory and serum samples were negative for mer ##s - co ##v . ser ##olo ##gic testing was done for 53 ( 75 % ) of 71 non ##sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic contacts ; all results were negative . among contacts , the use of ff ##p ##2 / ff ##p ##3 face masks during aero ##sol exposure was more frequent after mer ##s - co ##v infection was suspected than before . infection control measures may have prevented nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of the virus .  
cross - species transmission of zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) can result in pan ##de ##mic disease outbreak ##s . middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , identified in 2012 , has caused 182 cases to date , with ~ 43 % mortality , and no small animal model has been reported . mer ##s - co ##v and pip ##ist ##rell ##us bat corona ##virus ( bt ##co ##v ) strain hk ##u ##5 of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( β - co ##v ) subgroup 2 ##c share > 65 % identity at the amino acid level in several regions , including non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 5 ( ns ##p ##5 ) and the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein , which are significant drug and vaccine targets . bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 has been described in si ##lic ##o but has not been shown to replicate in culture , thus ham ##per ##ing drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2 ##c β - co ##vs . we report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ec ##to ##dom ##ain ( bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 - se ) . this virus replicate ##s efficiently in cell culture and in young and aged mice , where the virus targets air ##way and al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells . unlike some subgroup 2 ##b sar ##s - co ##v vaccines that eli ##cit a strong e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lia following challenge , we demonstrate that bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 and mer ##s - co ##v n - expressing venezuelan e ##quin ##e en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus rep ##lic ##on particle ( vr ##p ) vaccines do not cause extensive e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lia following bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 - se challenge . passage of bt ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 - se in young mice resulted in enhanced vi ##ru ##lence , causing 20 % weight loss , diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , and h ##yal ##ine membrane formation in aged mice . passage ##d virus was characterized by mutations in the ns ##p ##13 , ns ##p ##14 , open reading frame 5 ( or ##f ##5 ) and m genes . finally , we identified an inhibitor active against the ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##ses of subgroup 2 ##c β - co ##vs . synthetic - genome platforms capable of rec ##ons ##ti ##tu ##ting emerging zoo ##not ##ic viral pathogen ##s or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad - based therapeutic ##s , evaluating vaccine outcomes , and studying viral pathogen ##esis .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) develops an antagonist ##ic mechanism by which to evade the anti ##vira ##l activities of inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) . previous studies suggested that sar ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) inhibit ##s activation of the ir ##f ##3 pathway , which would normally eli ##cit a robust if ##n response , but the mechanism ( s ) used by sar ##s pl ##pro to inhibit activation of the ir ##f ##3 pathway is not fully known . in this study , we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how sar ##s pl ##pro efficiently inhibit ##s activation of the ir ##f ##3 pathway . we found that expression of the membrane - anchored pl ##pro domain ( pl ##pro - t ##m ) from sar ##s - co ##v inhibit ##s sting / tb ##k ##1 / ik ##k ##ε - mediated activation of type i if ##ns and disrupt ##s the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and dime ##rization of ir ##f ##3 , which are activated by sting and tb ##k ##1 . meanwhile , we showed that pl ##pro - t ##m physically interact ##s with tr ##af ##3 , tb ##k ##1 , ik ##k ##ε , sting , and ir ##f ##3 , the key components that assemble the sting - tr ##af ##3 - tb ##k ##1 complex for activation of if ##n expression . however , the interaction between the components in sting - tr ##af ##3 - tb ##k ##1 complex is disrupted by pl ##pro - t ##m . furthermore , sar ##s pl ##pro - t ##m reduces the levels of u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##ted forms of rig - i , sting , tr ##af ##3 , tb ##k ##1 , and ir ##f ##3 in the sting - tr ##af ##3 - tb ##k ##1 complex . these results collectively point to a new mechanism used by sar ##s - co ##v through which pl ##pro negatively regulates ir ##f ##3 activation by interaction with sting - tr ##af ##3 - tb ##k ##1 complex , yielding a sar ##s - co ##v counter ##me ##as ##ure against host innate immunity .  
background : many respiratory viruses di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ately impact the elderly . likewise , advanced age correlated with more adverse disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection in humans . we used an aged african green monkey sar ##s - co ##v infection model to better understand age - related mechanisms of increased su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to viral respiratory infections . non ##hum ##an primate ##s are critical translation ##al models for such research given their similarities to humans in immune - age ##ing as well as lung structure . results : significant age - and infection - dependent differences were observed in both systemic and mu ##cos ##al immune compartments . peripheral l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , specifically cd ##8 t and b cells were significantly lower in aged monkeys pre - and post - sar ##s - co ##v infection , while ne ##ut ##rop ##hil and mono ##cy ##te numbers were not impacted by age or infection status . serum pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines were similar in both age groups , whereas significantly lower levels of il - 1b ##eta , il - 18 , il - 6 , il - 12 and il - 15 were detected in the lungs of sar ##s - co ##v - infected aged monkeys at either 5 or 10 days post infection . total lung le ##uk ##oc ##yte numbers and relative frequency of cd ##8 t cells , b cells , macro ##pha ##ges and den ##dr ##itic cells were greatly reduced in the aged host during sar ##s - co ##v infection , despite high levels of che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##ts for many of these cells in the aged lung . den ##dr ##itic cells and mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges showed age - dependent differences in activation and che ##mo ##kin ##e receptor profiles , while the cd ##8 t cell and b cell responses were significantly reduced in the aged host . in examination of viral ti ##ters , significantly higher levels of sar ##s - co ##v were detected in the nasal sw ##ab ##s early , at day 1 post infection , in aged as compared to juvenile monkeys , but virus levels were only slightly higher in aged animals by day 3 . although there was a trend of higher ti ##ters in respiratory tissues at day 5 post infection , this did not reach statistical significance and virus was cleared from all animals by day 10 , regardless of age . conclusions : this study provides unique insight into how several parameters of the systemic and mu ##cos ##al immune response to sar ##s - co ##v infection are significantly mod ##ulated by age . these immune differences may contribute to def ##icient immune function and the observed trend of higher sar ##s - co ##v replication in aged non ##hum ##an primate ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute respiratory disease caused by the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . sar ##s - co ##v entry is facilitated by the spike protein ( s ) , which consists of an n - terminal domain ( s ##1 ) responsible for cellular attachment and a c - terminal domain ( s ##2 ) that media ##tes viral and host cell membrane fusion . the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 is a potential drug target , as pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tics against s ##2 act as potent fusion inhibitors . in this study , site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is and thermal stability experiments on electro ##static , hydro ##phobic , and polar residues to di ##sse ##ct their roles in stab ##ili ##zing the s ##2 post ##fusion conform ##ation was performed . it was shown that unlike the ph - independent retro ##vira ##l fusion proteins , sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 is stable over a wide ph range , supporting its ability to fuse at both the plasma membrane and end ##oso ##me . a comprehensive sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 analysis showed that specific hydro ##phobic positions at the c - terminal end of the hr ##2 , rather than electro ##static ##s are critical for fusion protein stabilization . disruption of the conserved c - terminal hydro ##phobic residues des ##ta ##bil ##ized the fusion core and reduced the melting temperature by 30 ##° ##c . the importance of the c - terminal hydro ##phobic residues led us to identify a 42 - residue sub ##st ##ru ##cture on the central core that is structurally conserved in all existing co ##v s ##2 fusion proteins ( root mean squared deviation = 0 . 4 a ) . this is the first study to identify such a conserved sub ##st ##ru ##cture and likely represents a common foundation to facilitate viral fusion . we have discussed the role of key residues in the design of fusion inhibitors and the potential of the sub ##st ##ru ##cture as a general target for the development of novel therapeutic ##s against co ##v infections .  
complete middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) genome sequences were obtained from nasal sw ##ab ##s of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s sampled in the kingdom of saudi arabia through direct analysis of nuclei ##c acid extracts or following virus isolation in cell culture . consensus dr ##ome ##dar ##y mer ##s - co ##v genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human mer ##s - co ##v sequences . however , in contrast to individual human cases , where only cl ##onal gen ##omic sequences are reported , detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one gen ##omic variant in individual dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . if humans are truly infected only with cl ##onal virus populations , we must entertain a model for inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission of mer ##s - co ##v wherein only specific gen ##otype ##s are capable of passing bottle ##neck selection .  
background : corona ##virus membrane ( m ) proteins are capable of interacting with nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and envelope ( e ) proteins . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) m co - expression with either n or e is sufficient for producing virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) , although at a lower level compared to m , n and e co - expression . whether e can release from cells or e / n interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced v ##lp production is unknown . it also remains to be determined whether e palm ##ito ##yla ##tion or di ##sul ##fide bond formation plays a role in sar ##s - co ##v virus assembly . results : sar ##s - co ##v n is released from cells through an association with e protein - containing ve ##sic ##les . further analysis suggests that domains involved in e / n interaction are largely located in both car ##box ##yl - terminal regions . changing all three e cy ##stein ##e residues to alan ##ines did not ex ##ert negative effects on e release , e association with n , or e enhancement of v ##lp production , suggesting that e palm ##ito ##yla ##tion modification or di ##sul ##fide bond formation is not required for sar ##s - co ##v virus assembly . we found that removal of the last e car ##box ##yl - terminal residue markedly affected e release , n association , and v ##lp incorporation , but did not significantly compromise the contribution of e to efficient v ##lp production . conclusions : the independence of the sar ##s - co ##v e enhancement effect on v ##lp production from its viral packaging capacity suggests a distinct sar ##s - co ##v e role in virus assembly .  
background : public health risks associated to infection by human corona ##virus ##es remain considerable and va ##cci ##nation is a key option for preventing the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we have previously reported that antibodies eli ##cite ##d by a sar ##s - co ##v vaccine candidate based on rec ##om ##bina ##nt , full - length sar ##s - co ##v spike - protein trim ##ers , trigger infection of immune cell lines . these observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody - mediated infection in human macro ##pha ##ges . methods : we have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection by sar ##s - co ##v in the presence of anti - spike antibodies . flu ##orescence microscopy and real - time quantitative reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection . to gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism , we performed mutation ##al analysis with a series of truncated and chi ##meric construct ##s of fragment crystal ##li ##za ##ble γ receptors ( fc ##γ ##r ) , which bind antibody - coated pathogen ##s . results : we show here that anti - spike immune serum increased infection of human mono ##cy ##te - derived macro ##pha ##ges by replication - competent sar ##s - co ##v as well as spike - pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles ( sar ##s - co ##v ##pp ) . macro ##pha ##ges infected with sar ##s - co ##v , however , did not support productive replication of the virus . pu ##rified anti - viral i ##ggs , but not other soluble factor ( s ) from heat - inactivated mouse immune serum , were sufficient to enhance infection . antibody - mediated infection was dependent on signaling - competent members of the human fc ##γ ##ri ##i family , which were shown to con ##fer su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to otherwise naive st ##48 ##6 cells , as binding of immune complexes to cell surface fc ##γ ##ri ##i was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) of infection . furthermore , only fc ##γ ##ri ##i with intact cy ##top ##las ##mic signaling domains were competent to sustain ad ##e of sar ##s - co ##v ##pp infection , thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by fc ##γ ##ri ##i . conclusions : these results demonstrate that human macro ##pha ##ges can be infected by sar ##s - co ##v as a result of i ##gg - mediated ad ##e and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to fc ##γ ##ri ##i receptors .  
the broad range and diversity of inter ##fer ##on - stimulated genes ( is ##gs ) function to induce an anti ##vira ##l state within the host , imp ##eding viral pathogen ##esis . while successful respiratory viruses overcome individual is ##g effect ##ors , analysis of the global is ##g response and subsequent viral ant ##ago ##nism has yet to be examined . employing models of the human air ##way , transcript ##omics and pro ##te ##omics data ##set ##s were used to compare is ##g response patterns following highly pathogen ##ic h ##5 ##n ##1 av ##ian influenza ( hp ##ai ) a virus , 2009 pan ##de ##mic h ##1 ##n ##1 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . the results illustrated distinct approaches utilized by each virus to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze the global is ##g response . in addition , the data revealed that highly vi ##ru ##lent hp ##ai virus and mer ##s - co ##v induce rep ##ress ##ive his ##tone modifications , which down ##re ##gul ##ate expression of is ##g subset ##s . notably , influenza a virus ns ##1 appears to play a central role in this his ##tone - mediated down ##re ##gul ##ation in highly pathogen ##ic influenza strains . together , the work demonstrates the existence of unique and common viral strategies for controlling the global is ##g response and provides a novel avenue for viral ant ##ago ##nism via altered his ##tone modifications .  
we investigated a case of human infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) after exposure to infected camel ##s . analysis of the whole human - derived virus and 15 % of the camel - derived virus sequence yielded nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism signatures suggest ##ive of cross - species transmission . camel ##s may act as a direct source of human mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
we identified the near - full - genome sequence ( 29 , 90 ##8 nt , > 99 % ) of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from a nasal sw ##ab specimen from a dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel in egypt . we found that viruses genetically very similar to human mer ##s - co ##v are in ##fect ##ing dr ##ome ##dar ##ies beyond the arabian peninsula , where human mer ##s - co ##v infections have not yet been detected .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of a highly lethal pneumonia . here , we report the full - genome sequence of the jordan - n ##3 / 2012 strain after serial passage in two distinct mammalian cell lines . the genome exhibits noteworthy stability , which may inform the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s used to treat infection with this virus .  
backgrounds : a new highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has emerged in jed ##dah and saudi arabia and quickly spread to some european countries since september 2012 . until 15 may 2014 , it has infected at least 57 ##2 people with a fatal ##ity rate of about 30 % globally . studies to understand the virus and to develop anti ##vira ##l drugs or therapy are necessary and urgent . in the present study , mer ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ( pro ) ) is expressed , and its structural and functional consequences are el ##uc ##ida ##ted . results : circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm and ty ##r / tr ##p flu ##orescence analyses indicated that the secondary and tertiary structure of mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) is well organized and folded . analytical ultra ##cent ##ri ##fu ##gation analyses demonstrated that mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) is a mono ##mer in solution . the steady - state kinetic and de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##ination activity ass ##ays indicated that mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) exhibits potent de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##ination activity but lower pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity , compared with sar ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) . a natural mutation , le ##u ##10 ##5 , is the major reason for this difference . conclusions : overall , mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) bound by an end ##ogen ##ous metal ion shows a folded structure and potent pro ##te ##ol ##ytic and de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##ination activity . these findings provide important insights into the structural and functional properties of corona ##vira ##l pl ( pro ) family , which is applicable to develop strategies inhibit ##ing pl ( pro ) against highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) represents a current threat to the arabian peninsula , and potential pan ##de ##mic disease . as of june 3 , 2014 , mer ##s co ##v has reportedly infected 68 ##8 people and killed 282 . we briefly sum ##mar ##ize the state of the outbreak , and highlight una ##ns ##wer ##ed questions and various explanations for the observed ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . findings : the continuing but in ##fr ##e ##quent cases of mer ##s - co ##v reported over the past two years have been pu ##zzling and difficult to explain . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v , with many sporadic cases and a few hospital outbreak ##s , yet no sustained epidemic , suggests a low reproductive number . furthermore , a clear source of infection to humans remains unknown . also pu ##zzling is the fact that mer ##s - co ##v has been present in saudi arabia over several mass gatherings , including the 2012 and 2013 ha ##j ##j and um ##rah pilgrimage ##s , which pre ##dis ##pose to epidemic ##s , without an epidemic arising . conclusions : the observed ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v is quite distinct and does not clearly fit either a sporadic or epidemic pattern . possible explanations of the unusual features of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v include sporadic ongoing infections from a non - human source ; human to human transmission with a large proportion of und ##ete ##cted cases ; or a combination of both . the virus has been identified in camel ##s ; however the mode of transmission of the virus to humans remains unknown , and many cases have no history of animal contact . in order to gain a better understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s co ##v , further investigation is warrant ##ed .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is of global concern – causing severe respiratory illness with 97 confirmed cases and 46 deaths ( 1 ) . therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo , thus patient management relies exclusively on supportive care , which given the high case - fatal ##ity rate is not highly effective . the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue is the only known disease model for mer ##s - co ##v , developing an acute localized - to - widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease ( 2 , 3 ) that rec ##ap ##it ##ulates mild - to - moderate human mer ##s - co ##v cases ( 4 , 5 ) . the combination of inter ##fer ##on - α ##2 ##b and rib ##avi ##rin was effective in reducing mer ##s - co ##v replication in vitro ( 6 ) ; therefore , this strategy was initiated 8 h post - infection in the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model . treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no - to - very mild radio ##graphic evidence of pneumonia . moreover , treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic ( serum ) and local ( lung ) pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies , altered gene expression and less severe his ##top ##ath ##ological changes in the lungs . taken together , these data suggest that treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infected r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues with if ##n - α ##2 ##b and rib ##avi ##rin reduces virus replication , moderate ##s the host response and improves clinical outcome . as these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic , if ##n - α ##2 ##b and rib ##avi ##rin should be considered for management of mer ##s - co ##v cases .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent for the infectious disease , sar ##s , which first emerged 10 years ago . sar ##s - co ##v is a zoo ##not ##ic virus that has crossed the species barriers to in ##fect humans . bats , which harbour a diverse pool of sar ##s - like co ##vs ( sl - co ##vs ) , are believed to be the natural reservoir . the sar ##s - co ##v surface spike ( s ) protein is a major antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt in eli ##cit ##ing neutral ##izing antibody production during sar ##s - co ##v infection . in our previous work , we showed that a panel of mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) that target the s ##2 subunit of the s protein are capable of neutral ##izing sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro ( lip km et al , j vi ##rol . 2006 jan ; 80 ( 2 ) : 94 ##1 – 50 ) . in this study , we report our findings on the characterization of one of these mab ##s , known as 1a ##9 , which binds to the s protein at a novel ep ##ito ##pe within the s ##2 subunit at amino acids 111 ##1 – 113 ##0 . mab 1a ##9 is a broadly neutral ##izing mab that prevents viral entry mediated by the s proteins of human and ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##vs as well as bat sl - co ##vs . by generating mutant sar ##s - co ##v that escapes the neutral ##ization by mab 1a ##9 , the residue d ##11 ##28 in s was found to be crucial for its interaction with mab 1a ##9 . s protein containing the substitution of d ##11 ##28 with alan ##ine ( d ##11 ##28 ##a ) exhibited a significant decrease in binding capability to mab 1a ##9 compared to wild - type s protein . by using a pseudo ##type ##d viral entry ass ##ay , it was shown that the d ##11 ##28 ##a substitution in the escape virus allows it to overcome the viral entry block ##age by mab 1a ##9 . in addition , the d ##11 ##28 ##a mutation was found to ex ##ert no effects on the s protein cell surface expression and incorporation into vi ##rion particles , suggesting that the escape virus retains the same viral entry property as the wild - type virus .  
on september 20 , 2012 , a saudi arabian physician reported the isolation of a novel corona ##virus from a patient with pneumonia on prom ##ed - mail . within a few days the same virus was detected in a qatar ##i patient receiving intensive care in a london hospital , a situation reminiscent of the role air travel played in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 . sar ##s - co ##v originated in china ’ s guangdong province and affected more than 800 ##0 patients in 26 countries before it was contained six months later . over a year after the emergence of this novel corona ##virus — middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) — it has caused 178 laboratory confirmed cases and 76 deaths the emergence of a second highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus within a decade highlights the importance of a coordinated global response incorporating reservoir surveillance , high - containment capacity with fundamental and applied research programs , and depend ##able communication pathways to ensure outbreak containment . here we review the current state of knowledge on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , ecology , molecular biology , clinical features and intervention strategies of the novel corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v .  
we obtained the full genome of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from a camel in qatar . this virus is highly similar to the human england / qatar 1 virus isolated in 2012 . the mer ##s - co ##v from the camel efficiently replicate ##d in human cells , providing further evidence for the zoo ##not ##ic potential of mer ##s - co ##v from camel ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus that has been circulating in the arabian peninsula since 2012 and causing severe respiratory infections in humans . while bats were suggested to be involved in human mer ##s - co ##v infections , a direct link between bats and mer ##s - co ##v is uncertain . on the other hand , ser ##ological and vi ##rol ##ogical data suggest dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s as the potential animal reservoirs of mer ##s - co ##v . recently , we isolated mer ##s - co ##v from a camel and its infected owner and provided evidence for the direct transmission of mer ##s - co ##v from the infected camel to the patient . here , we extend this work and show that identical mer ##s - co ##v rna fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel in our previous study . these data indicate that the virus was circulating in this farm concurrently with its detection in the camel and in the patient , which warrant ##s further investigations for the possible airborne transmission of mer ##s - co ##v .  
emerging respiratory corona ##virus ##es such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) pose potential biological threats to humans . sar ##s and mer ##s are manifested as severe at ##yp ##ical pneumonia associated with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in humans . the majority of studies carried out in sar ##s - co ##v - infected humans and animals attribute a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated / ex ##uber ##ant innate response as a leading contributor to sar ##s - co ##v - mediated pathology . a decade after the 2002 – 2003 sar ##s epidemic , we do not have any approved prevent ##ive or therapeutic agents available in case of re - emergence of sar ##s - co ##v or other related viruses . a strong neutral ##izing antibody response generated against the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v is completely protective in the susceptible host . however , neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters and the memory b cell response are short - lived in sar ##s - recovered patients and the antibody will target primary homo ##log ##ous strain . interesting ##ly , the acute phase of sar ##s in humans is associated with a severe reduction in the number of t cells in the blood . surprisingly , only a limited number of studies have explored the role of the t cell - mediated adaptive immune response in respiratory corona ##virus pathogen ##esis . in this review , we discuss the role of anti - virus cd ##4 and cd ##8 t cells during respiratory corona ##virus infections with a special emphasis on emerging corona ##virus ##es .  
macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis is exploited by many pathogen ##s for entry into cells . corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v are important human pathogen ##s ; however , macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis during co ##v infection has not been investigated . we demonstrate that the co ##vs sar ##s co ##v and mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) induce macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis , which occurs late during infection , is continuous , and is not associated with virus entry . m ##h ##v - induced macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis results in ve ##sic ##le internal ##ization , as well as extended fi ##lo ##pod ##ia capable of fu ##sing with distant cells . m ##h ##v - induced macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis requires fu ##so ##genic spike protein on the cell surface and is dependent on ep ##ider ##mal growth factor receptor activation . inhibition of macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis reduces super ##nat ##ant viral ti ##ters and sync ##yt ##ia but not intra ##cellular virus ti ##ters . these results indicate that macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis likely facilitates co ##v infection through enhanced cell - to - cell spreading . our studies are the first to demonstrate virus use of macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis for a role other than entry and suggest a much broader potential exploitation of macro ##pin ##oc ##yt ##osis in virus replication and host interactions .  
background : the first documented case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) occurred in 2012 , and outbreak ##s have continued ever since , mainly in saudi arabia . mer ##s - co ##v is primarily diagnosed using a real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay , with at least two different gen ##omic targets required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition of the world health organization ( who ) as of 3 july 2013 . therefore , it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow stable diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infections . methods : reverse transcription - loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) is a genetic diagnostic method used widely for the detection of viral pathogen ##s , which requires only a single temperature for amp ##li ##fication , and can be completed in less than 1 h . this study developed a novel rt - lamp ass ##ay for detecting mer ##s - co ##v using prime ##r sets targeting a conserved nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein region . results : the rt - lamp ass ##ay was capable of detecting as few as 3 . 4 copies of mer ##s - co ##v rna , and was highly specific , with no cross - reaction to other respiratory viruses . pilot experiments to detect mer ##s - co ##v from medium containing ph ##ary ##nge ##al sw ##ab ##s in ##oc ##ulated with pre - ti ##tra ##ted viruses were also performed . the rt - lamp ass ##ay exhibited sensitivity similar to that of mer ##s - co ##v real - time rt - pc ##r . conclusions : these results suggest that the rt - lamp ass ##ay described here is a useful tool for the diagnosis and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic surveillance of human mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
a rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) lacking the envelope ( e ) protein is at ##ten ##uated in vivo . here we report that e protein pd ##z - binding motif ( p ##bm ) , a domain involved in protein - protein interactions , is a major deter ##mina ##nt of vi ##ru ##lence . elimination of sar ##s - co ##v e protein p ##bm by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the del ##eter ##ious ex ##ace ##rba ##tion of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus at ##ten ##uation . cellular protein syn ##ten ##in was identified to bind the e protein p ##bm during sar ##s - co ##v infection by using three complementary strategies , yeast two - hybrid , reciprocal co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation and con ##fo ##cal microscopy ass ##ays . syn ##ten ##in red ##ist ##ri ##bu ##ted from the nucleus to the cell cy ##top ##las ##m during infection with viruses containing the e protein p ##bm , act ##ivating p ##38 map ##k and leading to the over ##ex ##press ##ion of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines . si ##len ##cing of syn ##ten ##in using sir ##nas led to a decrease in p ##38 map ##k activation in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells , further rein ##for ##cing their functional relationship . active p ##38 map ##k was reduced in lungs of mice infected with sar ##s - co ##vs lacking e protein p ##bm as compared with the parental virus , leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines and to virus at ##ten ##uation . interesting ##ly , administration of a p ##38 map ##k inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with sar ##s - co ##v , confirming the relevance of this pathway in sar ##s - co ##v vi ##ru ##lence . therefore , the e protein p ##bm is a vi ##ru ##lence domain that activate ##s im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology most likely by using syn ##ten ##in as a media ##tor of p ##38 map ##k induced inflammation .  
corona ##virus ##es have traditionally been associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections throughout the world . in the fall of 2002 , a new corona ##virus emerged in in asia causing severe viral pneumonia , i . e . , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . nearly a decade following the sar ##s epidemic , a new corona ##virus causing severe viral pneumonia has emerged , i . e . , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . since the initial case of mer ##s - co ##v occurred in june of 2012 in saudi arabia there have been 68 ##8 confirmed cases and 282 deaths in 20 countries . although both sar ##s and mer ##s are caused by corona ##virus ##es , sar ##s was characterized by efficient human transmission and relatively low mortality rate . in contrast , mer ##s is relatively in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##ntly transmitted to humans but has a high mortality rate . given the potential overlap in presentation and manifestation , it is important to understand the clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic differences between mer ##s , sar ##s and influenza .  
the availability of a robust disease model is essential for the development of counter ##me ##as ##ures for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . while a r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model of mer ##s - co ##v has been established , the lack of uniform , severe disease in this model com ##pl ##icate ##s the analysis of counter ##me ##as ##ure studies . modeling of the interaction between the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and its receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common mar ##mos ##ets and humans . the suit ##ability of the mar ##mos ##et as a mer ##s - co ##v model was tested by in ##oc ##ulation via combined intra ##tra ##che ##al , intra ##nas ##al , oral and o ##cular routes . most of the mar ##mos ##ets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to eu ##than ##asia of some animals . extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals nec ##rop ##sie ##d at different time points post in ##oc ##ulation . some animals were also vi ##rem ##ic ; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals , and total rna ##se ##q demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways . this is the first description of a severe , partially lethal , disease model of mer ##s - co ##v , and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more detailed pathogen ##esis studies .  
purpose : this study describes the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia . patients and methods : ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analysis was performed on data from all mer ##s - co ##v cases recorded by the saudi ministry of health between june 6 , 2013 and may 14 , 2014 . the frequency of cases and deaths was calculated and adjusted by month , sex , age group , and region . the average monthly temperature and humidity of infected regions throughout the year was also calculated . results : a total of 425 cases were recorded over the study period . the highest number of cases and deaths occurred between april and may 2014 . disease occurrence among men ( 260 cases [ 62 % ] ) was higher than in women ( 162 cases [ 38 % ] ) , and the case fatal ##ity rate was higher for men ( 52 % ) than for women ( 23 % ) . in addition , those in the 45 – 59 years and ≥ ##60 years age groups were most likely to be infected , and the case fatal ##ity rate for these people was higher than for other groups . the highest number of cases and deaths were reported in ri ##yad ##h ( 169 cases ; 43 deaths ) , followed by jed ##dah ( 156 cases ; 36 deaths ) and the eastern region ( 24 cases ; 22 deaths ) . the highest case fatal ##ity rate was in the eastern region ( 92 % ) , followed by medina ##h ( 36 % ) and na ##j ##ran ( 33 % ) . mer ##s - co ##v infection actively causes disease in environments with low relative humidity ( < 20 % ) and high temperature ( 15 ##° ##c – 35 ##° ##c ) . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v is considered an epidemic in saudi arabia . the frequency of cases and deaths is higher among men than women , and those above 45 years of age are most affected . low relative humidity and high temperature can enhance the spread of this disease in the entire population . further analytical studies are required to determine the source and mode of infection in saudi arabia .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) belongs to the corona ##vir ##idae family . in spite of several outbreak ##s in the very recent years , no vaccine against this deadly virus is developed yet . in this study , the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of mer ##s - co ##v was analyzed through computational im ##mun ##ology approach to identify the antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts ( ep ##ito ##pes ) . in order to do so , the sequences of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that belong to different geographical regions were aligned to observe the con ##ser ##van ##cy of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d . the immune parameters of this region were determined using different in si ##lic ##o tools and immune ep ##ito ##pe database ( ie ##db ) . molecular docking study was also employed to check the affinity of the potential ep ##ito ##pe towards the binding cl ##eft of the specific h ##la all ##ele . the n - terminus rb ##d ( s ##36 ##7 - s ##60 ##6 ) of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was found to be conserved among all the available strains of mer ##s - co ##v . based on the lower ic ( 50 ) value , a total of eight potential t - cell ep ##ito ##pes and 19 major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex ( m ##hc ) class - i all ##eles were identified for this conserved region . a 9 - mer ep ##ito ##pe cy ##ss ##li ##ld ##y displayed interactions with the maximum number of m ##hc class - i molecules and projected the highest peak in the b - cell antigen ##ici ##ty plot which concludes that it could be a better choice for designing an ep ##ito ##pe based peptide vaccine against mer ##sco ##v considering that it must undergo further in vitro and in vivo experiments . moreover , in molecular docking study , this ep ##ito ##pe was found to have a significant binding affinity of - 8 . 5 kc ##al / mo ##l towards the binding cl ##eft of the h ##la - c * 12 : 03 molecule .  
in 2013 in tunisia , 3 persons in 1 family were infected with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . the index case - patient ’ s respiratory tract samples were negative for mer ##s - co ##v by reverse transcription pc ##r , but diagnosis was retrospective ##ly confirmed by pc ##r of serum . sequences clustered with those from saudi arabia and united arab emirates .  
the culture super ##nat ##ants of the emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) were submitted to three temperatures over time and tested for in ##fect ##ivity by tc ##id ( 50 ) method on ve ##ro e ##6 cells . at 56 ##° ##c , almost 25 minutes were necessary to reduce the initial ti ##tre by 4 log ( 10 ) . increasing temperature to 65 ##° ##c had a strong negative effect on viral in ##fect ##ivity as vi ##ru ##ci ##dy dropped significantly to 1 minute . on the contrary , no significant decrease in ti ##tre was observed after 2 hours at 25 ##° ##c . these data might be useful in establishing bio ##sa ##fe ##ty measures in laboratories against mer ##s - co ##v .  
background : in may 2014 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , with closely related viral genome ##s , was diagnosed in two dutch residents , returning from a pilgrimage to medina and mecca , kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) . these patients travelled with a group of 29 other dutch travellers . we conducted an ep ##ide ##mi ##ological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source ( s ) of infection and presence of potential risk factors . methods : all travellers , including the two cases , completed a question ##naire focus ##sing on potential human , animal and food exposure ##s to mer ##s - co ##v . the question ##naire was modified from the who mer ##s - co ##v question ##naire , taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group . results : twelve non - cases drank un ##pas ##te ##urized camel milk and had contact with camel ##s . most travellers , including one of the two patients ( case 1 ) , visited local markets , where six of them consumed fruits . two travellers , including case 1 , were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in medina . four travellers , including case 1 , visited two hospitals in mecca . all travellers had been in contact with case 1 while he was sick , with initially non - respiratory complaints . the cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co - mor ##bid ##ities . conclusions : this ep ##ide ##mi ##ological study revealed the complexity of mer ##s - co ##v outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposure ##s to mer ##s - co ##v reported such as healthcare visits , camel exposure , and exposure to un ##tre ##ated food products . exposure to mer ##s - co ##v during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for case 1 but not for case 2 . for case 2 , the most likely source could not be determined . exposure to mer ##s - co ##v via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two dutch cases . furthermore , exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out . more comprehensive research into sources of infection in the arabian peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in 2012 resulted in an increased concern of the spread of the infection globally . mer ##s - co ##v infection had previously caused multiple health - care - associated outbreak ##s and resulted in transmission of the virus within families . community onset mer ##s - co ##v cases continue to occur . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are currently the most likely animal to be linked to human mer ##s - co ##v cases . ser ##olo ##gic tests showed significant infection in adult camel ##s compared to juvenile camel ##s . the control of mer ##s - co ##v infection relies on prompt identification of cases within health care facilities , with institutions applying appropriate infection control measures . in addition , determining the exact route of transmission from camel ##s to humans would further add to the control measures of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
the development of an effective vaccine is critical for prevention of a middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) pan ##de ##mic . some studies have indicated the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) is a good candidate antigen for a mer ##s - co ##v subunit vaccine . however , highly pu ##rified proteins are typically not inherently im ##mun ##ogenic . we hypothesis ##ed that humor ##al and cell - mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the va ##cci ##nation regime ##n . therefore , the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of a novel mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different ad ##ju ##vant formulation ##s and delivery routes . different va ##cci ##nation regime ##ns were compared in bal ##b / c mice im ##mun ##ized 3 times intra ##mus ##cular ##ly ( i . m . ) with a vaccine containing 10 µ ##g of rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d in combination with either aluminium hydro ##xide ( al ##um ) alone , al ##um and poly ##ri ##bo ##ino ##sin ##ic acid ( poly i : c ) or al ##um and cy ##stein ##e - phosphate - gu ##ani ##ne ( cp ##g ) ol ##igo ##de ##ox ##yn ##uc ##le ##otide ##s ( o ##d ##n ) . the immune responses of mice va ##cci ##nated with rb ##d , incomplete fr ##eu ##nd ’ s ad ##ju ##vant ( if ##a ) and cp ##g o ##d ##n by a sub ##cut ##aneous ( s . c . ) route were also investigated . we evaluated the induction of rb ##d - specific humor ##al immunity ( total i ##gg and neutral ##izing antibodies ) and cellular immunity ( eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ay for if ##n - γ spot - forming cells and sp ##len ##oc ##yte cy ##tok ##ine production ) . our findings indicated that the combination of al ##um and cp ##g o ##d ##n opt ##imi ##zed the development of rb ##d - specific humor ##al and cellular immunity following subunit va ##cci ##nation . interesting ##ly , robust rb ##d - specific antibody and t - cell responses were induced in mice im ##mun ##ized with the rr ##b ##d protein in combination with if ##a and cp ##g o ##d ##n , but low level of neutral ##izing antibodies were eli ##cite ##d . our data suggest that mu ##rine immunity following subunit va ##cci ##nation can be tailored using ad ##ju ##vant combinations and delivery routes . the va ##cci ##nation regime ##n used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the mer ##s - co ##v subunit vaccine by eli ##cit ##ing effective humor ##al and cellular immune responses .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a recently isolated beta ##cor ##ona ##virus identified as the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of a frequently fatal disease in western asia , middle east respiratory syndrome . attempts to identify the natural reservoirs of mer ##s - co ##v have focused in part on dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . bats are also suspected to be reservoirs based on frequent detection of other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in these mammals . for this study , ten distinct cell lines derived from bats of diver ##gent species were exposed to mer ##s - co ##v . plaque ass ##ays , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ays , and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that six bat cell lines can be productive ##ly infected . we found that the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility or resistance of these bat cell lines directly co ##rre ##lates with the presence or absence of cell surface - expressed cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 , the functional human receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . human anti - cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 antibodies inhibit ##ed infection of susceptible bat cells in a dose - dependent manner . over ##ex ##press ##ion of human cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 receptor conferred mer ##s - co ##v su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to resistant bat cell lines . finally , sequential passage of mer ##s - co ##v in per ##missive bat cells established persistent infection with con ##com ##itan ##t down ##re ##gul ##ation of cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 surface expression . together , these results imply that bats indeed could be among the mer ##s - co ##v host spectrum , and that cellular restriction of mer ##s - co ##v is determined by cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 expression rather than by downstream restriction factors .  
between april 2012 and june 2014 , 820 laboratory - confirmed cases of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have been reported in the arabian peninsula , europe , north africa , southeast asia , the middle east , and the united states . the observed ep ##ide ##mi ##ology is different to sar ##s , which showed a classic epidemic curve and was over in eight months . the much longer persistence of mer ##s - co ##v in the population , with a lower reproductive number , some evidence of human - to - human transmission but an otherwise sporadic pattern , is difficult to explain . using available ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data , we implemented mathematical models to explore the transmission dynamics of mer ##s - co ##v in the context of mass gatherings such as the ha ##j ##j pilgrimage , and found a disc ##re ##pan ##cy between the observed and expected ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . the fact that no epidemic occurred in returning ha ##j ##j pilgrims in either 2012 or 2013 contra ##dict ##s the long persistence of the virus in human populations . the explanations for this disc ##re ##pan ##cy include an ongoing , repeated non ##hum ##an / sporadic source , a large proportion of und ##ete ##cted or un ##re ##port ##ed human - to - human cases , or a combination of the two . furthermore , mer ##s - co ##v is occurring in a region that is a major global transport hub and hosts significant mass gatherings , making it imperative to understand the source and means of the yet une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d and pu ##zzling ongoing persistence of the virus in the human population .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus , mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a new member in the lineage c of β - corona ##virus ( β - co ##v ) . the increased human cases and high mortality rate of mer ##s - co ##v infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines . in this review , the current advancement ##s and potential strategies in the development of mer ##s vaccines , particularly subunit vaccines based on mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein and its receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , are discussed . how to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel ad ##ju ##vant formulation ##s and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of mer ##s - co ##v vaccines are also addressed . overall , these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for mer ##s - co ##v in the future .  
to investigate potential transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) to health care workers in a hospital , we ser ##ological ##ly tested hospital contacts of the index case - patient in saudi arabia , 4 months after his death . none of the 48 contacts showed evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
in 2012 , a novel corona ##virus associated with severe respiratory disease in humans emerged in the middle east . ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigations identified dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s as the likely source of zoo ##not ##ic transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . here we provide experimental support for camel ##s as a reservoir for mer ##s - co ##v . we in ##oc ##ulated 3 adult camel ##s with a human isolate of mer ##s - co ##v and a transient , primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals . clinical signs of the mer ##s - co ##v infection were benign , but each of the camel ##s shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract . we detected infectious virus in nasal secret ##ions through 7 days post ##ino ##cula ##tion , and viral rna up to 35 days post ##ino ##cula ##tion . the pattern of shed ##ding and prop ##ens ##ity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camel ##s and the means of efficient camel - to - camel and camel - to - human transmission .  
to analyze the distribution of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) – ser ##op ##osi ##tive dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in eastern africa , we tested 189 archived serum samples accumulated during the past 30 years . we identified mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies in 81 . 0 % of samples from the main camel - export ##ing countries , sudan and somalia , suggesting long - term virus circulation in these animals .  
we tested , using a low starting dil ##ution , sequential serum samples from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , sheep and horses collected in dubai from february / april to october of 2005 and from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s for export / import testing between canada and usa in 2000 – 2001 . using a standard middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) neutral ##ization test , serial sera from three sheep and three horses were all negative while sera from 9 of 11 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from dubai were positive for antibodies supported by similar results in a mer ##s - co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nt partial spike protein antibody elisa . the two negative dubai camel ##s were both dr ##ome ##dar ##y calves and remained negative over the 5 months studied . the six dr ##ome ##dar ##y samples from usa and canada were negative in both tests . these results support the recent findings that infection with mer ##s - co ##v or a closely related virus is not a new occurrence in camel ##s in the middle east . therefore , interactions of mer ##s - co ##v at the human – animal interface may have been ongoing for several , perhaps many , years and by inference , a widespread pan ##de ##mic may be less likely unless significant evolution of the virus allow accelerated infection and spread potential in the human population .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was initially recognized as a source of severe respiratory illness and renal failure in 2012 . prior to 2014 , mer ##s - co ##v was mostly associated with sporadic cases of human illness , of presumed zoo ##not ##ic origin , though chains of person - to - person transmission in the healthcare setting were reported . in spring 2014 , large healthcare - associated outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v infection occurred in jed ##dah and ri ##yad ##h , kingdom of saudi arabia . to date the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information published by public health investigators in affected jurisdictions has been relatively limited . however , it is important that the global public health community have access to information on the basic ep ##ide ##mi ##ological features of the outbreak to date , including the basic reproduction number ( r ##0 ) and best estimates of case - fatal ##ity rates ( cf ##r ) . we sought to address these gaps using a publicly available line listing of mer ##s - co ##v cases . methods : r ##0 was estimated using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment ( “ idea ” ) method , while period - specific case fatal ##ity rates that incorporated non - attributed death data were estimated using monte carlo simulation . results : 70 ##7 cases were available for evaluation . 52 % of cases were identified as primary , with the rest being secondary . idea model fits suggested a higher r ##0 in jed ##dah ( 3 . 5 - 6 . 7 ) than in ri ##yad ##h ( 2 . 0 - 2 . 8 ) ; control parameters suggested more rapid reduction in transmission in the former city than the latter . the model accurately projected final size and end date of the ri ##yad ##h outbreak based on information available prior to the outbreak peak ; for jed ##dah , these projections were possible once the outbreak peaked . overall case - fatal ##ity was 40 % ; depending on the timing of 171 deaths un ##link ##ed to case data , outbreak cf ##r could be higher , lower , or equivalent to pre - outbreak cf ##r . conclusions : notwithstanding imperfect data , inference ##s about mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology important for public health prepared ##ness are possible using publicly available data sources . the r ##0 estimated in ri ##yad ##h appears similar to that seen for sar ##s - co ##v , but cf ##r appears higher , and indirect evidence suggests control activities ended these outbreak ##s . these data suggest this disease should be regarded with equal or greater concern than the related sar ##s - co ##v .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) spread to 32 countries and regions within a few months in 2003 . there were 53 ##27 sar ##s cases from november 2002 to may 2003 in mainland china , which involved 29 provinces , resulted in 34 ##9 deaths , and directly caused economic losses of $ 18 . 3 billion . methods : this study used an in - out flow model and flow mapping to visual ##ize and explore the spatial pattern of sar ##s transmission in different regions . in - out flow is measured by the in - out degree and cluster ##ing coefficient of sar ##s . flow mapping is an ex ##pl ##ora ##tory method of spatial visual ##ization for interaction data . results : the findings were as follows . ( 1 ) sar ##s in - out flow had a clear hierarchy . it formed two main centers , guangdong in south china and beijing in north china , and two secondary centers , shan ##xi and inner mongolia , both connected to beijing . ( 2 ) “ spring festival travel ” strengthened external flow , but “ sar ##s panic effect ” played a more significant role and pushed the external flow to the peak . ( 3 ) external flow and its three typical kinds showed obvious spatial het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y , such as self - spreading flow ( spatial displacement of sar ##s cases only within the province or municipality of onset and medical locations ) ; hospitalized flow ( spatial displacement of sar ##s cases that had been seen by a hospital doctor ) ; and migrant flow ( spatial displacement of sar ##s cases among migrant workers ) . ( 4 ) internal and external flow tended to occur in younger groups , and occupational differentiation was particularly evident . low - income groups of male migrants aged 19 – 35 years were the main routes of external flow . conclusions : during 2002 – 2003 , sar ##s in - out flow played an important role in country ##wide transmission of the disease in mainland china . the flow had obvious spatial het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y , which was influenced by migrants ’ behavior characteristics . in addition , the chinese holiday effect led to irregular spread of sar ##s , but the panic effect was more apparent in the middle and late stages of the epidemic . these findings constitute valuable input to prevent and control future serious infectious diseases like sar ##s . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##12 ##8 ##7 ##9 - 01 ##4 - 07 ##21 - y ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
between march and june 2014 the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) had a large outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v , renew ##ing fears of a major outbreak during the ha ##j ##j this october . using ks ##a ministry of health data , the mer ##s - co ##v scenario and modeling working group forecast incidence under three scenarios . in the expected incidence scenario , we estimate 6 . 2 ( 95 % prediction interval [ pi ] : 1 – 17 ) pilgrims will develop mer ##s - co ##v symptoms during the ha ##j ##j , and 4 . 0 ( 95 % pi : 0 – 12 ) foreign pilgrims will be infected but return home before developing symptoms . in the most pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic scenario , 47 . 6 ( 95 % pi : 32 – 66 ) cases will develop symptoms during the ha ##j ##j , and 29 . 0 ( 95 % pi : 17 – 43 ) will be infected but return home as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic . large numbers of mer ##s - co ##v cases are unlikely to occur during the 2014 ha ##j ##j even under pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic assumptions , but careful monitoring is still needed to detect possible mass infection events and minimize introductions into other countries .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging viral pathogen that primarily causes respiratory illness . we conducted a ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce study of bank ##ed human serum samples collected in 2012 from southern saudi arabia . sera from 300 animal workers ( 17 % with daily camel exposure ) and 50 non - animal - exposed controls were examined for ser ##ological evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection by a pseudo ##par ##tic ##le mer ##s - co ##v spike protein neutral ##ization ass ##ay . none of the sera rep ##rod ##uc ##ibly neutral ##ized the mer ##s - co ##v - pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ira ##l vector . these data suggest that ser ##ological evidence of zoo ##not ##ic transmission of mer ##s - co ##v was not common among animal workers in southern saudi arabia during july 2012 .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , enveloped positive - sense rna viruses , are characterized by club - like spikes that project from their surface , an unusually large rna genome , and a unique replication strategy . corona ##virus ##es cause a variety of diseases in mammals and birds ranging from enter ##itis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease chickens to potentially lethal human respiratory infections . here we provide a brief introduction to corona ##virus ##es discussing their replication and pathogen ##ici ##ty , and current prevention and treatment strategies . we will also discuss the outbreak ##s of the highly pathogen ##ic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the recently identified middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , an emerging human corona ##virus , causes severe acute respiratory illness with a 35 % mortality rate . in light of the recent surge in reported infections we have developed as ##ym ##metric five - prime ##r reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) ass ##ays for detection of mer ##s - co ##v . iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ass ##ays will facilitate the development of portable point - of - care diagnostic ##s that are crucial for management of emerging infections . the rt - lamp ass ##ays are designed to amp ##li ##fy mer ##s - co ##v gen ##omic lo ##ci located within the open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1a and or ##f ##1 ##b genes and upstream of the e gene . additionally we applied one - step strand displacement probe ##s ( os ##d ) for real - time sequence - specific verification of lamp amp ##lic ##ons . as ##ym ##metric amp ##li ##fication effect ##ed by incorporating a single loop prime ##r in each ass ##ay accelerated the time - to - result of the os ##d - rt - lamp ass ##ays . the resulting ass ##ays could detect 0 . 02 to 0 . 2 plaque forming units ( p ##fu ) ( 5 to 50 p ##fu / ml ) of mer ##s - co ##v in infected cell culture super ##nat ##ants within 30 to 50 min and did not cross - react with common human respiratory pathogen ##s .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a new human disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the disease is reported mainly in adults . data in children are scarce . the disease caused by mer ##s - co ##v in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestation ##s , and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults . poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical como ##rb ##idi ##ties . we report a new case of mer ##s - co ##v infection in a 9 - month - old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms , multi - organ dysfunction , and death . we reviewed the literature in an attempt to character ##ize the mode of presentation , the risk factors , and outcome of mer ##s - co ##v infection in the pediatric population .  
rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis of persons suspected of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection is important for timely implementation of infection control practices and disease management . in addition , monitoring molecular changes in the virus can help el ##uc ##ida ##te chains of transmission and identify mutations that might influence virus transmission efficiency . this was illustrated by a recent laboratory investigation we conducted on an imported mer ##s - co ##v case in greece . two oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens were collected on the 1 ( st ) and 2 ( n ##d ) day of patient hospital ##ization and tested using two real - time rt - pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) ass ##ays targeting the up ##e and or ##f - 1a regions of the mer ##s - co ##v genome and rt - pc ##r and partial sequencing of rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id genes . serum specimens were also collected and ser ##ological test were performed . results from the first sw ##ab sample were inc ##on ##clusive while the second sw ##ab was strongly positive for mer ##s - co ##v rna by rr ##t - pc ##r and confirmed positive by rt - pc ##r and partial gene sequencing . positive ser ##olo ##gic test results further confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection . full - length nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike gene coding sequences were later obtained from the positive sw ##ab sample . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to recent human - derived mer ##s - co ##v strains obtained in jed ##dah and ma ##kka ##h , saudi arabia , in april 2014 and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in saudi arabia and qatar . these findings were consistent with the patient ’ s history . we also identified a unique amino acid substitution in the spike receptor binding domain that may have implications for receptor binding efficiency . our initial inc ##on ##clusive rr ##t - pc ##r results highlight the importance of collecting multiple specimens from suspect mer ##s - co ##v cases and particularly specimens from the lower respiratory tract .  
background : bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , including those closely related to human pathogen ##s such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v . there are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in thailand , of which two are endemic species . due to the zoo ##not ##ic potential of co ##vs , standardized surveillance efforts to character ##ize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative . findings : a total of 62 ##6 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in eastern thailand between 2008 and 2013 ( 84 fe ##cal and 54 ##2 rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s ) . samples collected ( either fresh fe ##ces or rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s ) were placed directly into rna stabilization re ##age ##nt , transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at − ##80 ##° ##c until further analysis . co ##v rna was detected in 47 specimens ( 7 . 6 % ) , from 13 different bat species , using broadly reactive consensus pc ##r prime ##rs targeting the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase gene designed to detect all co ##vs . thirty seven alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , nine lineage d beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , and one lineage b beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v related ) were identified . six new bat co ##v reservoirs were identified in our study , namely cy ##no ##pt ##erus sphinx , tap ##ho ##zo ##us mel ##ano ##po ##gon , hip ##po ##side ##ros le ##ka ##gul ##i , rhino ##lo ##phus shame ##li , sc ##oto ##phi ##lus heath ##ii and mega ##der ##ma l ##yra . conclusions : co ##vs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species ro ##ost ##ing in similar or different locations . these data suggest that bat co ##v lineage ##s are not strictly concord ##ant with their hosts . our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of co ##vs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of thailand . further characterization of additional co ##v genes may be useful to better describe the co ##v diver ##gence .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic virus that causes severe respiratory illness accompanied by multi - organ dysfunction , resulting in a case fatal ##ity rate of approximately 40 % . as found in other corona ##virus ##es , the majority of the positive - stranded rna mer ##s - co ##v genome is translated into two poly ##pro ##tein ##s , one created by a rib ##osomal frames ##hi ##ft , that are cl ##ea ##ved at three sites by a papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se and at 11 sites by a 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) . since 3 ##cl ( pro ) is essential for viral replication , it is a leading candidate for therapeutic intervention . to accelerate the development of 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibitors , three crystal structures of a catalytic ##ally inactive variant ( c1 ##48 ##a ) of the mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) enzyme were determined . the aim was to co - crystal ##li ##ze the inactive enzyme with a peptide substrate . fort ##uit ##ously , however , in two of the structures the c - terminus of one proto ##mer is bound in the active site of a neighboring molecule , providing a snaps ##hot of an enzyme – product complex . in the third structure , two of the three proto ##mers in the as ##ym ##metric unit form a homo ##dim ##er similar to that of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) ; however , the third proto ##mer adopt ##s a radically different conform ##ation that is likely to correspond to a crystal ##log ##raphic mono ##mer , indicative of substantial structural plastic ##ity in the enzyme . the results presented here provide a foundation for the structure - based design of small - molecule inhibitors of the mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) enzyme .  
toll - like receptors ( t ##lr ##s ) are sensors that recognize molecular patterns from viruses , bacteria , and fungi to initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogen ##s . the emergence of highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a concern for global public health , as there is a lack of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine platforms and anti ##vira ##l therapeutic strategies . previously , it was shown that my ##d ##8 ##8 , an adapt ##or protein necessary for signaling by multiple t ##lr ##s , is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v infection in vivo . here , we demonstrate that t ##lr ##3 ( − / − ) , t ##lr ##4 ( − / − ) , and tram ( − / − ) mice are more susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v than wild - type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection . in contrast , mice def ##icient in the t ##lr ##3 / t ##lr ##4 adapt ##or tri ##f are highly susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection , showing increased weight loss , mortality , reduced lung function , increased lung pathology , and higher viral ti ##ters . distinct alterations in inflammation were present in tri ##f ( − / − ) mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v , including excess in ##filtration of ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s and inflammatory cell types that co ##rre ##late with increased pathology of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , including influenza virus infections . abe ##rran ##t pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ine , che ##mo ##kin ##e , and inter ##fer ##on - stimulated gene ( is ##g ) signaling programs were also noted following infection of tri ##f ( − / − ) mice that were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome following sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v infection . these findings highlight the importance of t ##lr adapt ##or signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus infections .  
in may 2014 , a traveler from the kingdom of saudi arabia was the first person identified with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in the united states . to evaluate transmission risk , we determined the type , duration , and frequency of patient contact among health care personnel ( hc ##p ) , household , and community contacts by using standard question ##naire ##s and , for hc ##p , global positioning system ( gps ) trace ##r tag logs . respiratory and serum samples from all contacts were tested for mer ##s - co ##v . of 61 identified contacts , 56 were interviewed . hc ##p exposure ##s occurred most frequently in the emergency department ( 69 % ) and among nurses ( 47 % ) ; some hc ##p had contact with respiratory secret ##ions . household and community contacts had brief contact ( e . g . , hugging ) . all laboratory test results were negative for mer ##s - co ##v . this contact investigation found no secondary cases , despite case - patient contact by 61 persons , and provides useful information about mer ##s - co ##v transmission risk . compared with gps trace ##r tag recordings , self - reported contact may not be as accurate .  
to assess the temporal dynamics of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , specimens were collected at 1 – 2 month intervals from 2 independent groups of animals during april 2013 – may 2014 in al - ah ##sa province , saudi arabia , and tested for mer ##s - co ##v rna by reverse transcription pc ##r . of 96 live camel ##s , 28 ( 29 . 2 % ) nasal sw ##ab samples were positive ; of 91 camel car ##cas ##ses , 56 ( 61 . 5 % ) lung tissue samples were positive . positive samples were more commonly found among young animals ( < 4 years of age ) than adults ( > 4 years of age ) . the proportions of positive samples varied by month for both groups ; detection peaked during november 2013 and january 2014 and declined in march and may 2014 . these findings further our understanding of mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and may help inform intervention strategies to reduce zoo ##not ##ic infections .  
two of the earliest middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) cases were men who had visited the doha central animal market and adjoining slaughter ##house in qatar . we show that a high proportion of camel ##s presenting for slaughter in qatar show evidence for nasal mer ##s - co ##v shed ##ding ( 62 / 105 ) . sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains at these premises , suggesting that this location is a driver of mer ##s - co ##v circulation and a high - risk area for human exposure . no correlation between rna loads and levels of neutral ##izing antibodies was observed , suggesting limited immune protection and potential for rein ##fect ##ion despite previous exposure .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . the continuous increase of mer ##s cases has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide , calling for development of safe and effective mer ##s vaccines . we have previously shown that a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein containing residues 37 ##7 – 58 ##8 of mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) fused with human fc ( s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc ) induced highly potent anti - mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies in the presence of m ##f ##59 ad ##ju ##vant . here we opt ##imi ##zed the doses of s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc using m ##f ##59 as an ad ##ju ##vant in order to eli ##cit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen . our results showed that s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc at 1 μ ##g was able to induce in the im ##mun ##ized mice potent humor ##al and cellular immune responses . particularly , s ##37 ##7 - 58 ##8 - fc at 1 μ ##g eli ##cite ##d strong neutral ##izing antibody responses against both pseudo ##type ##d and live mer ##s - co ##v similar to those induced at 5 and 20 μ ##g , respectively . these results suggest that this rb ##d - based subunit mer ##s vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one μ ##g is sufficiently potent to induce strong humor ##al and cellular immune responses , including neutral ##izing antibodies , against mer ##s - co ##v infection , thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dos ##age of rb ##d - based mer ##s vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dose - spa ##ring strategy in other subunit vaccine trials .  
background : infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in healthcare facilities . therefore , healthcare workers should be aware of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from mer ##s - co ##v . objective : the aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the dental students and evaluate their awareness about mer ##s - co ##v . materials and methods : a question ##naire was made according to mo ##h information and 200 dental students ( al - far ##abi colleges , jed ##dah ) were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge about mer ##s - co ##v . results : more than half of the dental students ( 54 % ) interviewed had good knowledge about the et ##iology , symptoms , and treatment of mer ##s - co ##v . measurements for infection control and protection were also known ( 79 % ) . the sources of information for the students were : college ( 27 % ) , mo ##h ( 25 % ) , media ( 24 % ) , and social community ( 23 % ) , while 17 % of the students interviewed had no idea about it . conclusion : dental students had good knowledge about mer ##s - co ##v . however , more information still must be provided by mo ##h and college for the medical staff .  
background : since the identification of the first case of infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia in june 2012 , the number of laboratory - confirmed cases has exceeded 94 ##1 cases globally , of which 34 ##7 died . the disease presents as severe respiratory infection often with shock , acute kidney injury , and coa ##gul ##opa ##thy . recently , we observed three cases who presented with ne ##uro ##logic symptoms . these are so far the first reported cases of ne ##uro ##logic injury associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection . methods : data was retrospective ##ly collected from three patients admitted with mer ##s - co ##v infection to intensive care unit ( ic ##u ) at king abdul ##azi ##z medical city , ri ##yad ##h . they were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ic ##u . finding : the three patients presented with severe ne ##uro ##logic syndrome which included altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma , ata ##xia , and focal motor deficit . brain mri revealed striking changes characterized by widespread , bilateral hyper ##int ##ense lesions on t ##2 - weighted imaging within the white matter and sub ##cor ##tical areas of the frontal , temporal , and par ##ie ##tal lobes , the basal gang ##lia , and corpus call ##os ##um . none of the lesions showed ga ##do ##lini ##um enhancement . interpretation : cn ##s involvement should be considered in patients with mer ##s - co ##v and progressive neurological disease , and further el ##uc ##ida ##tion of the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of this virus is needed . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##15 ##01 ##0 - 01 ##5 - 07 ##20 - y ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
background : the recent emergence of a novel corona ##virus in the middle east ( designated mer ##s - co ##v ) is a reminder of the zoo ##not ##ic and pathogen ##ic potential of emerging corona ##virus ##es in humans . clinical features of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) include at ##yp ##ical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v . the host response is a key component of highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus infection . here , we computational ##ly analyzed gene expression changes in a human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cell line infected with two genetically distinct mer ##s - co ##v strains obtained from human patients , mer ##s - co ##v sa 1 and mer ##s - co ##v eng 1 . results : using topological techniques , including persistence homo ##logy and filtered cluster ##ing , we performed a comparative transcription ##al analysis of human cal ##u - 3 cell host responses to the different mer ##s - co ##v strains , with mer ##s - co ##v eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes , between 3 and 12 hours post infection , compared to mer ##s - co ##v sa 1 . robust transcription ##al changes distinguished the two mer ##s - co ##v strains predominantly at the late time points . combining statistical analysis of infection and cy ##tok ##ine - stimulated cal ##u - 3 transcript ##omics , we identified differential innate responses , including up - regulation of extra ##cellular re ##mo ##del ##ing genes following mer ##s - co ##v eng 1 infection and differential pro - inflammatory responses . conclusions : through our gen ##omics - based approach , we found topological differences in the kinetic ##s and magnitude of the host response to mer ##s - co ##v sa 1 and mer ##s - co ##v eng 1 , with differential expression of innate immune and pro - inflammatory responsive genes as a result of if ##n , tn ##f and il - 1 ##α signaling . predicted activation for stat ##3 media ##ting gene expression relevant for ep ##ith ##elial cell - to - cell adhere ##ns and junction signaling in mer ##s - co ##v eng 1 infection suggest that these transcription ##al differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to mod ##ulate innate immunity during mer ##s - co ##v infection . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / 147 ##1 - 216 ##4 - 15 - 116 ##1 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) as a cause of severe respiratory disease highlights the need for effective approaches to co ##v vaccine development . efforts focused solely on the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the viral spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein may not opt ##imi ##ze neutral ##izing antibody ( na ##b ) responses . here we show that im ##mun ##ogen ##s based on full - length s dna and s ##1 subunit protein eli ##cit robust serum - neutral ##izing activity against several mer ##s - co ##v strains in mice and non - human primate ##s . ser ##ological analysis and isolation of mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies revealed that im ##mun ##ization eli ##cit ##s na ##bs to rb ##d and , non - rb ##d portions of s ##1 and s ##2 subunit . multiple neutral ##ization mechanisms were demonstrated by solving the atomic structure of a na ##b - rb ##d complex , through sequencing of neutral ##ization escape viruses and by constructing mer ##s - co ##v s variants for ser ##ological ass ##ays . im ##mun ##ization of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues con ##fers protection against mer ##s - co ##v - induced radio ##graphic pneumonia , as assessed using computer ##ized tom ##ography , supporting this strategy as a promising approach for mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development .  
all corona ##virus ##es , including the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from the β - co ##v subgroup , require the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity of the ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##se ( also known as 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se , 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) during virus replication , making it a high value target for the development of anti - corona ##virus therapeutic ##s . kinetic studies indicate that in contrast to 3 ##cl ( pro ) from other β - co ##v 2 ##c members , including hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 , mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) is less efficient at processing a peptide substrate due to mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) being a weakly associated dime ##r . conversely , hk ##u ##4 , hk ##u ##5 , and sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) enzymes are tightly associated dime ##rs . analytical ultra ##cent ##ri ##fu ##gation studies support that mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) is a weakly associated dime ##r ( k ( d ) [UNK] μ ##m ) with a slow off - rate . pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitors of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) were synthesized and utilized in analytical ultra ##cent ##ri ##fu ##gation experiments and demonstrate that mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) undergoes significant ligand - induced dime ##rization . kinetic studies also revealed that designed rev ##ers ##ible inhibitors act as act ##iva ##tors at a low compound concentration as a result of induced dime ##rization . primary sequence comparisons and x - ray structural analyses of two mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro and inhibitor complexes , determined to 1 . 6 a , reveal remarkable structural similarity of the dime ##r interface with 3 ##cl ( pro ) from hk ##u ##4 - co ##v and hk ##u ##5 - co ##v . despite this structural similarity , substantial differences in the dime ##rization ability suggest that long range interactions by the non ##con ##ser ##ved amino acids distant from the dime ##r interface may control mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) dime ##rization . activation of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) through ligand - induced dime ##rization appears to be unique within the gen ##og ##roup 2 ##c and may potentially increase the complexity in the development of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibitors as anti ##vira ##l agents .  
the n - terminal domain of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein from middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v np - nt ##d ) contains many positively charged residues and has been identified to be responsible for rna binding during rib ##on ##uc ##le ##oca ##ps ##id formation by the virus . in this study , the crystal ##lization and crystal ##log ##raphic analysis of mer ##s - co ##v np - nt ##d ( amino acids 39 – 165 ) , with a molecular weight of 14 . 7 k ##da , are reported . mer ##s - co ##v np - nt ##d was crystal ##lized at 293 k using peg 335 ##0 as a pre ##ci ##pit ##ant and a 94 . 5 % complete native data set was collected from a cooled crystal at 77 k to 2 . 63 a resolution with an overall r ( merge ) of 9 . 6 % . the crystals were mono ##cl ##ini ##c and belonged to space group p ##2 ( 1 ) , with unit - cell parameters a = 35 . 60 , b = 109 . 64 , c = 91 . 99 a , β = 101 . 22 ##° . the as ##ym ##metric unit contained four mer ##s - co ##v np - nt ##d molecules .  
the full genome sequence of a middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified from culture ##d and isolated in ve ##ro cells . the viral genome sequence has high similarity to 53 human mer ##s - co ##vs , ranging from 99 . 5 % to 99 . 8 % at the nu ##cle ##otide level .  
on 26 may 2015 , an imported middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified in guangdong province , china , and found to be closely related to the mer ##s - co ##v strain prevalent in south korea . the full genome of the china ##g ##d ##01 strain was sequence ##d and analyzed to investigate the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and evolution of mer ##s - co ##v circulating in south korea and china .  
the recently reported middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory illness in humans with an approximately 30 % mortality rate . the envelope spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein on the surface of mer ##s - co ##v media ##tes receptor binding , membrane fusion , and viral entry . we previously reported two human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that target the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike and exhibit strong neutral ##ization activity against live and pe ##su ##dot ##ype ##d mer ##s - co ##v infection . here we determined the crystal structure of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d bound to the fa ##b fragment of mer ##s - 27 antibody at 3 . 20 a resolution . the mer ##s - 27 ep ##ito ##pe in the rb ##d overlap ##s with the binding site of the mer ##s - co ##v receptor d ##pp ##4 . further bio ##chemical , viral entry , and neutral ##ization analyses identified two critical residues in the rb ##d for both mer ##s - 27 recognition and d ##pp ##4 binding . one of the residues , tr ##p ##53 ##5 , was found to function as an anchor residue at the binding interface with mer ##s - 27 . upon receptor binding , tr ##p ##53 ##5 interact ##s with the n - linked car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te moi ##ety of d ##pp ##4 . thus , mer ##s - 27 inhibit ##s mer ##s - co ##v infection by directly blocking both protein - protein and protein - car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te interactions between mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d and d ##pp ##4 . these results shed light on the molecular basis of mer ##s - 27 neutral ##ization and will assist in the optimization of mer ##s - 27 as a tool to combat mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
since middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) first emerged , the california department of public health has coordinated efforts to identify possible cases in travelers to california , usa , from affected areas . during 2013 – 2014 , the department investigated 54 travelers for mer ##s - co ##v ; none tested positive , but 32 ( 62 % ) of 52 travelers with suspected mer ##s - co ##v had other respiratory viruses .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes high fever , cough , acute respiratory tract infection and multi ##org ##an dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals . mer ##s - co ##v is thought to be transmitted to humans through dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . the occurrence of the virus was first reported in the middle east and it subsequently spread to several parts of the world . since 2012 , about 136 ##8 infections , including ~ 48 ##7 deaths , have been reported worldwide . notably , the recent human - to - human ‘ super ##sp ##rea ##ding ' of mer ##s - co ##v in hospitals in south korea has raised a major global health concern . the fatal ##ity rate in mer ##s - co ##v infection is four times higher compared with that of the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus infection . currently , no drug has been clinical ##ly approved to control mer ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we highlight the potential drug targets that can be used to develop anti - mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic ##s .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus has caused rec ##urrent outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula since 2012 . although mer ##s has low overall human - to - human transmission potential , there is occasional amp ##li ##fication in the healthcare setting , a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak ##s in 2003 . here we provide a head - to - head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of mer ##s and sar ##s , including the most recent south korean outbreak of mer ##s in 2015 . methods : to assess the unexpected nature of the recent south korean nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak of mer ##s and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters , we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of mer ##s and sar ##s , based on individual - level data and transmission tree information . we carried out simulations of nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s of mer ##s and sar ##s using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data , and in ##fer ##red the probability and characteristics of large outbreak ##s . results : a significant fraction of mer ##s cases were linked to the healthcare setting , ranging from 43 . 5 % for the nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak in jed ##dah , saudi arabia , in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in al - has ##a , saudi arabia , in 2013 and the outbreak in south korea in 2015 . both mer ##s and sar ##s nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s are characterized by early nos ##oco ##mia ##l super - spreading events , with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations . there was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of mer ##s and sar ##s : a majority of mer ##s cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case , whereas there was a greater concentration of sar ##s cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak . exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation , however , especially for sar ##s . moreover , the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreak ##s ( k ##rus ##kal – wallis test ; p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) , with significantly higher transmission het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in the distribution of secondary cases for mer ##s than sar ##s . simulations indicate a 2 - fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreak ##s ( > 100 cases ) for sar ##s than mer ##s ( 2 % versus 1 % ) ; however , owing to higher transmission het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y , the largest outbreak ##s of mer ##s are characterized by sharpe ##r incidence peaks . the probability of occurrence of mer ##s outbreak ##s larger than
the mer ##s - co ##v is an emerging virus , which already infected more than 1 , 300 humans with high ( [UNK] % ) mortality . here , we show that m3 ##36 , an exceptionally potent human anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibody , is almost ge ##rm ##line with only one so ##matic mutation in the heavy chain . the structure of fa ##b m3 ##36 in complex with the mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain reveals that its i ##gh ##v ##1 - 69 - derived heavy chain provides more than 85 % binding surface and that its ep ##ito ##pe almost completely overlap ##s with the receptor - binding site . analysis of antibodies from 69 healthy humans suggests an important role of the v ( d ) j rec ##om ##bina ##tion - generated junction ##al and all ##ele - specific residues for achieving high affinity of binding at such low levels of so ##matic hyper ##mut ##ation . our results also have important implications for development of vaccine im ##mun ##ogen ##s based on the newly identified m3 ##36 ep ##ito ##pe as well as for el ##uc ##ida ##tion of mechanisms of neutral ##ization by m3 ##36 - like antibodies and their eli ##cit ##ation in vivo .  
since its emergence in 2012 , more than 900 laboratory - confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) have been reported with a fatal ##ity rate of more than 30 % . however , no antigen detection ass ##ay for commercial use is available for diagnosis . in this study , the full - length nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) gene of mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was clone ##d and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . a mer ##s - co ##v np capture enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) using two mer ##s - co ##v - np - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) generated was developed . the elisa was evaluated using 129 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates ( np ##as ) positive for various respiratory viruses and simulated positive np ##as by adding serial dil ##ution ##s of mer ##s - co ##v . using a cut ##off o ##d of 0 . 19 , all 129 np ##as positive for respiratory viruses showed very low o ##d , with a specific ##ity of 100 % . for the two simulated mer ##s - co ##v - positive np ##as with serial dil ##ution ##s of live mer ##s - co ##v , all samples with ≥ ##10 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive dose ( tc ##id ( 50 ) ) / 0 . 1 ml showed positive results . for the 10 additional np ##as with 20 and 200 tc ##id ( 50 ) / 0 . 1 ml of live mer ##s - co ##v added , all were positive . a highly sensitive and specific mab ##s - based antigen capture elisa has been developed for mer ##s . this sensitive and specific antigen capture elisa should be useful for detection of mer ##s - co ##v in human and dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and in field studies .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) originated in bats and spread to humans via zoo ##not ##ic transmission from camel ##s . we analyzed the evolution of the spike ( s ) gene in beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es ( beta ##co ##vs ) isolated from different mammals , in bat corona ##virus populations , as well as in mer ##s - co ##v strains from the current outbreak . results indicated several positively selected sites located in the region comprising the two he ##pta ##d repeats ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) and their link ##er . two sites ( r ##65 ##2 and v ##10 ##60 ) were positively selected in the beta ##co ##vs ph ##yl ##ogen ##y and correspond to mutations associated with expanded host range in other corona ##virus ##es . during the most recent evolution of mer ##s - co ##v , adaptive mutations in the hr ##1 ( q / r / h ##10 ##20 ) arose in camel ##s or in a previous host and spread to humans . we determined that different residues at position 102 ##0 establish distinct inter - and intra - he ##lica ##l interactions and affect the stability of the six - helix bundle formed by the hr ##s . a similar effect on stability was observed for a nearby mutation ( t ##10 ##15 ##n ) that increases mer ##s - co ##v infection efficiency in vitro . data here ##in indicate that the he ##pta ##d repeat region was a major target of adaptive evolution in mer ##s - co ##v - related viruses ; these results are relevant for the design of fusion inhibitor peptide ##s with anti ##vira ##l function .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by the new beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( mer ##s corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v ) , which shows high mortality rates . the typical symptoms of mer ##s are fever , cough , and short ##ness of breath , and it is often accompanied by pneumonia . the mer ##s - co ##v was introduced to republic of korea in may 2015 by a patient returning from saudi arabia . the disease spread mostly through hospital infections , and by the time the epidemic ended in august , the total number of confirmed dia ##gno ##ses was 186 , among which 36 patients died . reflecting the latest evidence for anti ##vira ##l drugs in the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infection and the experiences of treating mer ##s patients in republic of korea , these guidelines focus on anti ##vira ##l drugs to achieve effective treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a recently identified virus causing severe viral respiratory illness in people . little is known about the reservoir in the horn of africa . in kenya , where no human mer ##s cases have been reported , our survey of 335 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , representing nine herds in lai ##ki ##pia county , showed a high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce ( 46 . 9 % ) to mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . between herd differences were present ( 14 . 3 % – 82 . 9 % ) , but was not related to management type or herd isolation . further research should focus on identifying similarity between mer ##s - co ##v viral isolate ##s in kenya and clinical isolate ##s from the middle east and elsewhere .  
we conducted an ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigation among survivors of an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in jordan . a second - trim ##ester still ##bir ##th occurred during the course of an acute respiratory illness that was attributed to mer ##s - co ##v on the basis of exposure history and positive results of mer ##s - co ##v ser ##olo ##gic testing . this is the first occurrence of still ##bir ##th during an infection with mer ##s - co ##v and may have bearing upon the surveillance and management of pregnant women in settings of une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d respiratory illness potentially due to mer ##s - co ##v . future prospective investigations of mer ##s - co ##v should as ##cer ##tain pregnancy status and obtain further pregnancy - related data , including biological specimens for confirm ##atory testing .  
we investigated an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) at king fa ##had medical city ( k ##fm ##c ) , ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , during march 29 – may 21 , 2014 . this outbreak involved 45 patients : 8 infected outside k ##fm ##c , 13 long - term patients at k ##fm ##c , 23 health care workers , and 1 who had an ind ##eter ##minate source of infection . sequences of full - length mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from 10 patients and a partial sequence of mer ##s - co ##v from another patient , when compared with other mer ##s - co ##v sequences , demonstrated that this outbreak was part of a larger outbreak that affected multiple health care facilities in ri ##yad ##h and possibly arose from a single zoo ##not ##ic transmission event that occurred in december 2013 ( 95 % highest posterior density interval november 8 , 2013 – february 10 , 2014 ) . this finding suggested continued health care – associated transmission for 5 months . molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology documented multiple external introductions in a seemingly contiguous outbreak and helped support or ref ##ute transmission pathways suspected through ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigation .  
a sar ##s - co ##v lacking the full - length e gene ( sar ##s - co ##v - ∆ ##e ) was at ##ten ##uated and an effective vaccine . here , we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo , resulting in the partial du ##plication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8 ##a , respectively . the chi ##meric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained at ##ten ##uated in mice . in contrast , during sar ##s - co ##v - ∆ ##e passage in mice , the virus incorporated a mu ##tated variant of 8 ##a protein , resulting in rev ##ers ##ion to a vi ##ru ##lent ph ##eno ##type . when the full - length e protein was deleted or its pd ##z - binding motif ( p ##bm ) was mu ##tated , the rev ##ert ##ant viruses either incorporated a novel chi ##meric protein with a p ##bm or restored the sequence of the p ##bm on the e protein , respectively . similarly , after passage in mice , sar ##s - co ##v - ∆ ##e protein 8 ##a mu ##tated , to now en ##code a p ##bm , and also regained vi ##ru ##lence . these data indicated that the virus requires a p ##bm on a trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the e protein . to increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate , we introduced small at ##ten ##uating del ##eti ##ons in e gene that did not affect the end ##ogen ##ous p ##bm , preventing the incorporation of novel chi ##meric proteins in the virus genome . in addition , to increase vaccine bio ##sa ##fe ##ty , we introduced additional at ##ten ##uating mutations into the ns ##p ##1 protein . del ##eti ##ons in the car ##box ##y - terminal region of ns ##p ##1 protein led to higher host inter ##fer ##on responses and virus at ##ten ##uation . rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses including at ##ten ##uating mutations in e and ns ##p ##1 genes maintained their at ##ten ##uation after passage in vitro and in vivo . further , these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus , and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against sar ##s - co ##v .  
since the first imported case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection was reported on may 20 , 2015 in korea , there have been 186 laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection with 36 fatalities . ninety - seven percent ( 181 / 186 ) of the cases had exposure to the health care facilities . we are reporting a super ##sp ##rea ##ding event that transmitted mer ##s - co ##v to 81 persons at a hospital emergency room ( er ) during the korean outbreak in 2015 . the index case was a 35 - y ##r - old man who had vigorous coughing while staying at the er for 58 hr . as in severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak ##s , super ##sp ##rea ##ding events can cause a large outbreak of mer ##s in healthcare facilities with severe consequences . all healthcare facilities should establish and implement infection prevention and control measure as well as tri ##age policies and procedures for early detection and isolation of suspected mer ##s - co ##v cases .  
the outbreak ##s of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) previously in middle east and recently in south korea have raised serious concerns world - wide , rein ##for ##cing the importance of developing effective and safe vaccines against mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . a number of vaccine candidates have been developed on the basis of viral vectors , rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins , dna ##s , nano ##par ##tic ##les , and rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v , and some of them have shown efficacy in laboratory animals . however , the pau ##city of financial support has made it difficult to transfer effective candidates from the pre ##cl ##ini ##cal stage to clinical trials . here , we sum ##mar ##ize currently available mer ##s vaccine candidates and illustrate strategies for future development , with the aim of pro ##voking government agencies and big ph ##arm ##a to invest more funds for developing e ##ffi ##ca ##cious and safe mer ##s vaccines .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a novel infectious disease caused by a corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 . mer ##s later spread to other countries in the arabian peninsula , followed by an outbreak in south korea in 2015 . at least 26 countries have reported mer ##s cases , and these numbers may increase over time . due to international travel opportunities , all countries are at risk of imported cases of mer ##s , even if outbreak ##s do not spread globally . therefore , it is essential for emergency department ( ed ) personnel to be able to rapidly assess mer ##s risk and take immediate actions if indicated . the identify - isolate - inform ( 3 ##i ) tool , originally conceived for initial detection and management of e ##bola virus disease patients in the ed and later adjusted for me ##as ##les , can be adapted for real - time use for any emerging infectious disease . this paper reports a modification of the 3 ##i tool for use in initial detection and management of patients under investigation for mer ##s . following an assessment of ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic risk factors , including travel to countries with current mer ##s transmission and contact with patients with confirmed mer ##s within 14 days , patients are risk st ##rat ##ified by type of exposure coupled with symptoms of fever and respiratory illness . if criteria are met , patients must be immediately placed into airborne infection isolation ( or a private room until this type of isolation is available ) and the emergency practitioner must alert the hospital infection prevention and control team and the local public health department . the 3 ##i tool will facilitate rapid cat ##ego ##rization and triggering of appropriate time - sensitive actions for patients presenting to the ed at risk for mer ##s .  
the newly - emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) can cause severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans . despite global efforts , the potential for an associated pan ##de ##mic in the future cannot be excluded . the development of effective counter - measures is urgent . mer ##s - co ##v - specific anti - viral drugs or vaccines are not yet available . using the spike receptor - binding domain of mer ##s - co ##v ( mer ##s - rb ##d ) to im ##mun ##ize mice , we identified two neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) 4 ##c ##2 and 2 ##e ##6 . both mab ##s potent ##ly bind to mer ##s - rb ##d and block virus entry in vitro with high efficacy . we further investigated their mechanisms of neutral ##ization by crystal ##li ##zing the complex between the fa ##b fragments and the rb ##d , and solved the structure of the 4 ##c ##2 fa ##b / mer ##s - rb ##d complex . the structure showed that 4 ##c ##2 recognizes an ep ##ito ##pe that partially overlap ##s the receptor - binding footprint in mer ##s - rb ##d , thereby interfering with the virus / receptor interactions by both ste ##ric hind ##rance and interface - residue competition . 2 ##e ##6 also blocks receptor binding , and competes with 4 ##c ##2 for binding to mer ##s - rb ##d . based on the structure , we further human ##ized 4 ##c ##2 by preserving only the para ##top ##e residues and sub ##stituting the remaining amino acids with the counterparts from human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins . the human ##ized 4 ##c ##2 ( 4 ##c ##2 ##h ) antibody sustained similar neutral ##izing activity and bio ##chemical characteristics to the parental mouse antibody . finally , we showed that 4 ##c ##2 ##h can significantly aba ##te the virus ti ##ters in lungs of ad ##5 - hc ##d ##26 - trans ##duced mice infected with mer ##s - co ##v , therefore representing a promising agent for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and therapy in clinical settings .  
background . the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was discovered september 2012 in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) . the first us case of mer ##s - co ##v was confirmed on 2 may 2014 . methods . we sum ##mar ##ize the clinical symptoms and signs , laboratory and radio ##logic findings , and mer ##s - co ##v – specific tests . results . the patient is a 65 - year - old physician who worked in a hospital in ks ##a where mer ##s - co ##v patients were treated . his illness onset included mala ##ise , my ##al ##gia ##s , and low - grade fever . he flew to the united states on day of illness ( doi ) 7 . his first respiratory sy ##mpt ##om , a dry cough , developed on doi 10 . on doi 11 , he presented to an indiana hospital as d ##ys ##p ##ne ##ic , h ##yp ##ox ##ic , and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radio ##graphy . on doi 12 , his serum tested positive by real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) for mer ##s - co ##v and showed high mer ##s - co ##v antibody ti ##ters , whereas his nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab was rr ##t - pc ##r negative . expect ##ora ##ted sp ##ut ##um was rr ##t - pc ##r positive the following day , with a high viral load ( 5 . 31 × 10 ( 6 ) copies / ml ) . he was treated with antibiotics , intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin , and oxygen by nasal can ##nu ##la . he was discharged on doi 22 . the genome sequence was similar ( > 99 % ) to other known mer ##s - co ##v sequences , cluster ##ing with those from ks ##a from june to july 2013 . conclusions . this patient had a prolonged non ##sp ##ec ##ific pro ##dro ##mal illness before developing respiratory symptoms . both sera and sp ##ut ##um were rr ##t - pc ##r positive when nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al specimens were negative . us clinic ##ians must be vi ##gil ##ant for mer ##s - co ##v in patients with feb ##ril ##e and / or respiratory illness with recent travel to the arabian peninsula , especially among healthcare workers .  
as of september 30 , 2015 , a total of 158 ##9 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have been reported to the world health organization ( who ) . at present there is no effective specific therapy against mer ##s - co ##v . the use of con ##vale ##scent plasma ( cp ) has been suggested as a potential therapy based on existing evidence from other viral infections . we aim to study the feasibility of cp therapy as well as its safety and clinical and laboratory effects in critically ill patients with mer ##s - co ##v infection . we will also examine the ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic ##s of the mer ##s - co ##v antibody response and viral load over the course of mer ##s - co ##v infection . this study will inform a future random ##ized controlled trial that will examine the efficacy of cp therapy for mer ##s - co ##v infection . in the cp collection phase , potential donors will be tested by the enzyme linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) and the indirect fluorescent antibody ( if ##a ) techniques for the presence of anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . subjects with anti - mer ##s - co ##v if ##a ti ##ter of ≥ ##1 : 160 and no clinical or laboratory evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection will be screened for eligibility for plasma donation according to standard donation criteria . in the cp therapy phase , 20 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit with laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection will be enrolled and each will receive 2 units of cp . post enrollment , patients will be followed for clinical and laboratory outcomes that include anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibodies and viral load . this protocol was developed collaborative ##ly by king abdullah international medical research center ( kai ##m ##rc ) , gulf cooperation council ( g ##cc ) infection control center group and the world health organization — international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium ( isa ##ric - who ) mer ##s - co ##v working group . it was approved in june 2014 by the ministry of the national guard health affairs institutional review board ( ir ##b ) . a data safety monitoring board ( ds ##mb ) was formulated . the study is registered at http : / / www . clinical ##tri ##als . gov ( nc ##t ##0 ##21 ##90 ##7 ##9 ##9 ) .  
to gain entry into the target cell , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) uses its spike ( s ) protein s ##2 subunit to fuse with the plasma or end ##osomal membrane . previous work identified a peptide derived from the he ##pta ##d repeat ( hr ) 2 domain in s ##2 subunit , hr ##2 ##p , which potent ##ly blocked mer ##s - co ##v s protein – mediated membrane fusion . here , we tested an hr ##2 ##p analogue with improved pharmaceutical property , hr ##2 ##p - m2 , for its inhibitor ##y activity against mer ##s - co ##v infection in vitro and in vivo . hr ##2 ##p - m2 was highly effective in inhibit ##ing mer ##s - co ##v s protein – mediated cell - cell fusion and infection by pseudo ##virus ##es expressing mer ##s - co ##v s protein with or without mutation in the hr ##1 region . it interact ##ed with the hr ##1 peptide to form stable α - he ##lica ##l complex and blocked six - helix bundle formation between the hr ##1 and hr ##2 domains in the viral s protein . intra ##nas ##ally administered hr ##2 ##p - m2 effectively protected aden ##ov ##irus ser ##otype - 5 – human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 – trans ##duced mice from infection by mer ##s - co ##v strains with or without mutations in the hr ##1 region of s protein , with > 1000 - fold reduction of viral ti ##ters in lung , and the protection was enhanced by combining hr ##2 ##p - m2 with inter ##fer ##on β . these results indicate that this combination regime ##n merits further development to prevent mer ##s in high - risk populations , including healthcare workers and patient family members , and to treat mer ##s - co ##v – infected patients .  
many corona ##virus ##es are capable of inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission . some of them have caused worldwide panic as emerging human pathogen ##s in recent years , e . g . , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . in order to assess their threat to humans , we explored to in ##fer the potential hosts of corona ##virus ##es using a dual - model approach based on nineteen parameters computed from spike genes of corona ##virus ##es . both the support vector machine ( sv ##m ) model and the mahal ##ano ##bis distance ( md ) disc ##rim ##ina ##nt model achieved high acc ##ura ##cies in leave - one - out cross - validation of training data consisting of 730 representative corona ##virus ##es ( 99 . 86 % and 98 . 08 % respectively ) . predictions on 47 additional corona ##virus ##es precisely conform ##ed to conclusions or speculation ##s by other researchers . our approach is implemented as a web server that can be accessed at http : / / bio ##in ##fo . i ##h ##b . ac . cn / se ##q ##2 ##hos ##ts .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel and highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus and has quickly spread to other countries in the middle east , europe , north africa and asia since 2012 . previous studies have shown that mer ##s - co ##v or ##f ##4 ##b ant ##ago ##ni ##zes the early anti ##vira ##l alpha / beta inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - α / β ) response , which may significantly contribute to mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis ; however , the underlying mechanism is poorly understood . here , we found that or ##f ##4 ##b in the cy ##top ##las ##m could specifically bind to tank binding kinase 1 ( tb ##k ##1 ) and i ##κ ##b kinase epsilon ( ik ##k ##ε ) , suppress the molecular interaction between mitochondrial anti ##vira ##l signaling protein ( ma ##vs ) and ik ##k ##ε , and inhibit if ##n regulatory factor 3 ( ir ##f ##3 ) ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and subsequent if ##n - β production . further analysis showed that or ##f ##4 ##b could also inhibit ir ##f ##3 and ir ##f ##7 - induced production of if ##n - β , whereas del ##eti ##on of the nuclear local ##ization signal of or ##f ##4 ##b ab ##rogated its ability to inhibit ir ##f ##3 and ir ##f ##7 - induced production of if ##n - β , but not if ##n - β production induced by rig - i , md ##a ##5 , ma ##vs , ik ##k ##ε , and tb ##k - 1 , suggesting that or ##f ##4 ##b could inhibit the induction of if ##n - β in both the cy ##top ##las ##m and nucleus . collectively , these results indicate that mer ##s - co ##v or ##f ##4 ##b inhibit ##s the induction of type i if ##n through a direct interaction with ik ##k ##ε / tb ##k ##1 in the cy ##top ##las ##m , and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism . viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or th ##wart a host ’ s anti ##vira ##l responses . a novel human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , is distinguished from other corona ##virus ##es by its high pathogen ##ici ##ty and mortality . however , vi ##ru ##lence deter ##mina ##nts that distinguish mer ##s - co ##v from other hc ##ov ##s have yet to be identified . mer ##s - co ##v or ##f ##4 ##b ant ##ago ##ni ##zes the early anti ##vira ##l response , which may contribute to mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis . here , we report the identification of the inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) ant ##ago ##nism mechanism of mer ##s - co ##v or ##f ##4 ##b . mer ##s -
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) with pan ##de ##mic potential is a major worldwide threat to public health . however , vaccine development for this pathogen la ##gs behind as immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown . in this study , an im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics - driven genome - wide screening strategy of vaccine targets was performed to thoroughly screen the vital and effective dominant im ##mun ##ogen ##s against mer ##s - co ##v . con ##ser ##van ##cy and population coverage analysis of the ep ##ito ##pes were done by the immune ep ##ito ##pe database . the results showed that the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v might be a better protective im ##mun ##ogen with high con ##ser ##van ##cy and potential eli ##cit ##ing both neutral ##izing antibodies and t - cell responses compared with spike ( s ) protein . further , the b - cell , help ##er t - cell and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ( ct ##l ) ep ##ito ##pes were screened and mapped to the n protein . a total of 15 linear and 10 conform ##al b - cell ep ##ito ##pes that may induce protective neutral ##izing antibodies were obtained . additionally , a total of 71 peptide ##s with 9 - mer core sequence were identified as help ##er t - cell ep ##ito ##pes , and 34 peptide ##s were identified as ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes . based on the maximum h ##la binding all ##eles , top 10 help ##er t - cell ep ##ito ##pes and ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes that may eli ##cit protective cellular immune responses against mer ##s - co ##v were selected as mer ##s vaccine candidates . population coverage analysis showed that the put ##ative help ##er t - cell ep ##ito ##pes and ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes could cover the vast majority of the population in 15 geographic regions considered where vaccine would be employed . the b - and t - cell stimulation potential ##s of the screened ep ##ito ##pes is to be further valid ##ated for their efficient use as vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v . collectively , this study provides novel vaccine target candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v and other emerging infectious diseases .  
we investigated the kinetic ##s of ser ##olo ##gic responses to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection by using virus neutral ##ization and mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 i ##gg elisa tests . in most patients , robust antibody responses developed by the third week of illness . delayed antibody responses with the neutral ##ization test were associated with more severe disease .  
introduction : since the first case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection was reported in 2012 , the virus has infected more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries , and caused more than 480 deaths . human - to - human transmission requires close contact , and has typically occurred in the healthcare setting . improved global awareness , together with improved hygiene practices in healthcare facilities , has been highlighted as key strategies in controlling the spread of mer ##s - co ##v . this study tested the in vitro efficacy of three formulation ##s of po ##vid ##one io ##dine ( pv ##p - i : 4 % pv ##p - i skin clean ##ser , 7 . 5 % pv ##p - i surgical scrub , and 1 % pv ##p - i ga ##rg ##le / mouth ##wash ) against a reference virus ( modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara , mv ##a ) and mer ##s - co ##v . methods : according to en ##14 ##47 ##6 , a standard suspension test was used to assess vi ##ru ##ci ##dal activity against mv ##a and large volume pl ##ating was used for mer ##s - co ##v . all products were tested under clean ( 0 . 3 g / l bo ##vine serum album ##in , bs ##a ) and dirty conditions ( 3 . 0 g / l bs ##a + 3 . 0 ml / l er ##yt ##hr ##ocytes ) , with application times of 15 , 30 , and 60 s for mv ##a , and 15 s for mer ##s - co ##v . the products were tested und ##il ##uted , 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 dil ##uted against mv ##a , and und ##il ##uted against mer ##s - co ##v . results : a reduction in virus ti ##ter of ≥ ##4 log ( 10 ) ( corresponding to an ina ##ct ##ivation of ≥ ##9 ##9 . 99 % ) was regarded as evidence of vi ##ru ##ci ##dal activity . this was achieved versus mv ##a and mer ##s - co ##v , under both clean and dirty conditions , within 15 s of application of each und ##il ##uted pv ##p - i product . conclusion : these data indicate that pv ##p - i - based hand wash products for potentially contaminated skin , and pv ##p - i ga ##rg ##le / mouth ##wash for reduction of viral load in the oral cavity and the oro ##pha ##ryn ##x , may help to support hygiene measures to prevent transmission of mer ##s - co ##v . funding : mu ##ndi ##pha ##rma research gmbh & co . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##40 ##12 ##1 - 01 ##5 - 00 ##9 ##1 - 9 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .
since the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak in the republic of korea ( here ##af ##ter korea ) began on may 11 , 2015 , a total of 186 persons have been infected by the mer ##s corona ##virus , 38 of whom have died . with this number , korea becomes second only to the kingdom of saudi arabia in the ranking of cumulative mer ##s cases . in this paper korea ’ s unique experience of an outbreak of mer ##s will be summarized and discussed briefly .  
background : a highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has emerged in jed ##dah and other places in saudi arabia , and has quickly spread to european and asian countries since september 2012 . up to the 1 ( st ) october 2015 it has infected at least 159 ##3 people with a global fatal ##ity rate of about 35 % . studies to understand the virus are necessary and urgent . in the present study , mer ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) is expressed ; the dime ##rization of the protein and its relationship to cat ##aly ##sis are investigated . methods and results : the crystal structure of mer ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) indicates that it shares a similar sc ##af ##fold to that of other corona ##vira ##l m ( pro ) and consists of ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like domains i and ii and a he ##lica ##l domain iii of five he ##lices . analytical ultra ##cent ##ri ##fu ##gation analysis demonstrated that mer ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) undergoes a mono ##mer to dime ##r conversion in the presence of a peptide substrate . g ##lu ##16 ##9 is a key residue and plays a dual role in both dime ##rization and cat ##aly ##sis . the mu ##tage ##nes ##is of other residues found on the dime ##rization interface indicate that dime ##rization of mer ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) is required for its catalytic activity . one mutation , m2 ##9 ##8 ##r , resulted in a stable dime ##r with a higher level of pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity than the wild - type enzyme . conclusions : mer ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) shows substrate - induced dime ##rization and potent pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity . a critical assessment of the residues important to these processes provides insights into the correlation between dime ##rization and cat ##aly ##sis within the corona ##vira ##l m ( pro ) family .  
background : middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has spread rapidly across much of the middle east , but no quantitative mapping of transmission risk has been developed to date . moreover , details of the transmission cycle of the virus remain unclear , particularly regarding the role of camel ##s as a reservoir host for human infections . methods : we present a first analysis of the environmental circumstances under which mer ##s - co ##v cases have occurred in the middle east , covering all case occurrences through may 2015 , using ecological niche modeling approaches to map transmission risk . we compare the environmental breadth of conditions under which cases have reported camel contacts with that of the broader population of all cases , to assess whether camel - associated cases occur under a more restricted set of environmental circumstances . results : we documented geographic and environmental distributions of mer ##s - co ##v cases across the middle east , and offer preliminary mapping of transmission risk . we confirm the idea that climatic dimensions of camel - associated cases are more constrained and less variable than the broader suite of case occurrences ; hence , camel exposure may be a key limiting element in mer ##s - co ##v transmission . conclusion : this study offers a first detailed geographic and environmental analysis of mer ##s - co ##v distributions across the middle east . results indicated that camel - exposed cases occur under a narrower suite of environmental conditions than non - camel - exposed cases , suggesting perhaps a key role for camel ##s in the transmission of the disease , and perhaps a narrower area of risk for ‘ primary , ’ camel - derived cases of mer ##s .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) epidemic ##s have proven the ability of corona ##virus ##es to cross species barrier and emerge rapidly in humans . other corona ##virus ##es such as por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus ( pe ##d ##v ) are also known to cause major disease epidemic ##s in animals wii ##th huge economic loss . this special issue in vi ##rol ##ogy journal aims to highlight the advances and key discoveries in the animal origin , viral evolution , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , diagnostic ##s and pathogen ##esis of the emerging and re - emerging corona ##virus ##es in both humans and animals .  
middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified to cause severe respiratory infection in humans since 2012 . the continuing mer ##s epidemic with a case - fatal ##ity of more than 30 % poses a major threat to public health worldwide . currently , the pathogen ##esis of human mer ##s - co ##v infection remains poorly understood . we reviewed experimental findings from human primary cells and ex vivo human lung tissues , as well as those from animal studies , so as to understand the pathogen ##esis and high case - fatal ##ity of mer ##s . human respiratory ep ##ith ##elial cells are highly susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v and can support productive viral replication . however , the induction of anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ines and pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es are substantially damp ##ened in the infected ep ##ith ##elial cells , due to the antagonist ##ic mechanisms evolved by the virus . mer ##s - co ##v can readily in ##fect and robust ##ly replicate in human macro ##pha ##ges and den ##dr ##itic cells , triggering the abe ##rran ##t production of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es . mer ##s - co ##v can also effectively in ##fect human primary t cells and induce massive ap ##op ##tosis in these cells . although data from clinical , in vitro and ex vivo studies suggested the potential for virus dissemination , extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry involvement in mer ##s patients has not been as ##cer ##tained due to the lack of autopsy study . in mer ##s - co ##v per ##missive animal models , although viral rna can be detected from multiple organs of the affected animals , the brain of human d ##pp ##4 - trans ##genic mouse was the only extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry organ from which the infectious virus can be recovered . more research findings on the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s and the tissue tr ##op ##isms of mer ##s - co ##v may help to improve the treatment and infection control of mer ##s .  
bats have been recognized as the natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses . special attention has been paid to bat corona ##virus ##es as the two emerging corona ##virus ##es which have caused unexpected human disease outbreak ##s in the 21st century , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , are suggested to be originated from bats . various species of horseshoe bats in china have been found to harbor genetically diverse sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es . some strains are highly similar to sar ##s - co ##v even in the spike protein and are able to use the same receptor as sar ##s - co ##v for cell entry . on the other hand , diverse corona ##virus ##es phylogenetic ##ally related to mer ##s - co ##v have been discovered worldwide in a wide range of bat species , some of which can be classified to the same corona ##virus species as mer ##s - co ##v . corona ##virus ##es genetically related to human corona ##virus 229 ##e and nl ##6 ##3 have been detected in bats as well . moreover , intermediate hosts are believed to play an important role in the transmission and emergence of these corona ##virus ##es from bats to humans . understanding the bat origin of human corona ##virus ##es is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pan ##de ##mic emergence in the future .  
the first known cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , associated with infection by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , occurred in 2012 in jordan but were reported retrospective ##ly . the case first to be publicly reported was from jed ##dah , in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) . since then , mer ##s - co ##v sequences have been found in a bat and in many dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ( dc ) . mer ##s - co ##v is enzo ##otic in dc across the arabian peninsula and in parts of africa , causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic , but relatively rare human infections . precisely how virus transmit ##s to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement . the ks ##a is the focal point of mer ##s , with the majority of human cases . in humans , mer ##s is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract ( l ##rt ) disease involving fever , cough , breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome , multi ##org ##an failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected . however , mer ##s - co ##v has also been detected in mild and influenza - like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms . older males most obviously suffer severe disease and mer ##s patients often have como ##rb ##idi ##ties . compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , another sometimes - fatal zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus disease that has since disappeared , mer ##s progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury ( it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions ) , is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal . most human cases of mer ##s have been linked to laps ##es in infection prevention and control ( ip ##c ) in healthcare settings , with approximately 20 % of all virus detection ##s reported among healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) and higher exposure ##s in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camel ##s . ser ##o - surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camel ##s and limited past exposure among humans . sensitive , valid ##ated reverse transcript ##ase real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - rt ##pc ##r ) - based diagnostic ##s have been available almost from the start of the emergence of mer ##s . while the basic vi ##rol ##ogy of mer ##s - co ##v has advanced over the past three years , understanding of the inter ##play between camel , environment , and human remains limited . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##12 ##9 ##85 -
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute respiratory failure and considerable extra ##pu ##mona ##ry organ d ##ys ##fu ##ction with substantial high mortality . for the limited number of autopsy reports , small animal models are urgently needed to study the mechanisms of mer ##s - co ##v infection and pathogen ##esis of the disease and to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we developed a trans ##genic mouse model globally expressing cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) , the receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . after intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation with mer ##s - co ##v , the mice rapidly developed severe pneumonia and multi - organ damage , with viral replication being detected in the lungs on day 5 and in the lungs , kidney ##s and brains on day 9 post - infection . in addition , the mice exhibited systemic inflammation with mild to severe pneumonia accompanied by the injury of liver , kidney and sp ##leen with ne ##ut ##rop ##hil and macro ##pha ##ge in ##filtration . importantly , the mice exhibited symptoms of paralysis with high viral burden and viral positive neurons on day 9 . taken together , this study character ##izes the tr ##op ##ism of mer ##s - co ##v upon infection . importantly , this hd ##pp ##4 - expressing trans ##genic mouse model will be applicable for studying the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v infection and investigating the efficacy of vaccines and anti ##vira ##l agents designed to combat mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
background . since the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , more than 1 , 300 laboratory confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infections have been reported in asia , north africa , and europe by july 2015 . the recent mer ##s - co ##v nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak in south korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month , second only to saudi arabia in country - specific number of reported cases . methods . we use a simple mathematical model , the richards model , to trace the temporal course of the south korea mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . we pin ##point its outbreak turning point and its trans ##mis ##sibility via basic reproduction number r ( 0 ) in order to as ##cer ##tain the occurrence of this nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control . results . the estimated outbreak turning point of t ( i ) = 23 . 3 days ( 95 % ci [ 22 . 6 – 24 . 0 ] ) , or 23 – 24 days after the onset date of the index case on may 11 , pin ##points june 3 – 4 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date . r ( 0 ) is estimated to range between 7 . 0 and 19 . 3 . discussion and conclusion . the turning point of the south korea mer ##s - co ##v outbreak occurred around may 27 – 29 , when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections by the index patient . furthermore , trans ##mis ##sibility of mer ##s - co ##v in the south korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past mer ##s - co ##v outbreak ##s in the middle east , which is at ##tri ##bu ##table to the nos ##oco ##mia ##l nature of this outbreak . our estimate of r ( 0 ) for the south korea mer ##s - co ##v nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and super ##sp ##rea ##ding events in crowded settings such as hospitals . similar to the 2003 sar ##s epidemic , outbreak ##s of infectious diseases with low community trans ##mis ##sibility like mer ##s - co ##v could still occur initially with large clusters of nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections , but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures .  
risk factors for primary middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) illness in humans are incomplete ##ly understood . we identified all primary mer ##s - co ##v cases reported in saudi arabia during march – november 2014 by excluding those with history of exposure to other cases of mer ##s - co ##v or acute respiratory illness of unknown cause or exposure to healthcare settings within 14 days before illness onset . using a case – control design , we assessed differences in underlying medical conditions and environmental exposure ##s among primary case - patients and 2 – 4 controls matched by age , sex , and neighborhood . using multi ##var ##iable analysis , we found that direct exposure to dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s during the 2 weeks before illness onset , as well as diabetes mel ##lit ##us , heart disease , and smoking , were each independently associated with mer ##s - co ##v illness . further investigation is needed to better understand animal - to - human transmission of mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel respiratory pathogen first reported in 2012 . during september 2014 – january 2015 , an outbreak of 38 cases of mer ##s was reported from 4 healthcare facilities in tai ##f , saudi arabia ; 21 of the 38 case - patients died . clinical and public health records showed that 13 patients were healthcare personnel ( hc ##p ) . fifteen patients , including 4 hc ##p , were associated with 1 dial ##ysis unit . three additional hc ##p in this dial ##ysis unit had ser ##olo ##gic evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection . viral rna was amplified from acute - phase serum specimens of 15 patients , and full spike gene - coding sequencing was obtained from 10 patients who formed a discrete cluster ; sequences from specimens of 9 patients were closely related . similar gene sequences among patients un ##link ##ed by time or location suggest un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed viral transmission . circulation persisted in multiple healthcare settings over an extended period , under ##sco ##ring the importance of strengthening mer ##s - co ##v surveillance and infection - control practices .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe cases of human respiratory disease . since 2012 , the victims have mainly come from the middle east countries or sporadic ##ally from some other geographical regions seeded by the travelers who visited the middle east . such an introduction through travelling led to the emergence of a mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in korea in may 2015 , which caused more than 140 confirmed human cases in less than a month . using 70 complete genome sequences of mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , including the most recent sequences for the korean and chinese isolate ##s , we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the complete genome and the individual protein coding regions . the korean mer ##s - co ##v strain clustered in the previously established ha ##fr - al - bat ##in - 1 _ 2013 clade together with two saudi arabian and one chinese strain sampled in 2015 . although these four strains remained mono ##phy ##let ##ic in the entire protein - coding region , this clade showed different phylogenetic relationships across the genome , indicating a shared unique rec ##om ##bina ##tion pattern that is different from previously reported put ##ative rec ##om ##bina ##tion strains . our findings suggest that the recent ancestor of the korean and its related mer ##s - co ##v strains is characterized by unique mosaic genome pattern that is different from other put ##ative rec ##om ##bina ##nts .  
background : it is crucial to understand the current status of clinical laboratory practices for the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections in the republic of korea to be well prepared for future emerging infectious diseases . methods : we conducted a survey of 49 clinical laboratories in medical institutions and refer ##ral medical laboratories . a short question ##naire to survey clinical laboratory practices relating to mer ##s - co ##v diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and clinical path ##ologists in charge of the clinical laboratories performing mer ##s - co ##v testing . the survey focused on testing volume , reporting of results , resources , and laboratory safety . results : a total of 40 clinical laboratories responded to the survey . a total of 27 , 00 ##9 mer ##s - co ##v real - time reverse transcription pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) tests were performed . most of the specimens were sp ##ut ##um ( 73 . 5 % ) . the median turn ##around time ( ta ##t ) was 5 . 29 hr ( first and third qu ##art ##ile , 4 . 11 and 7 . 48 hr ) in 26 medical institutions . the median ta ##t of more than a half of the laboratories ( 57 . 7 % ) was less than 6 hr . many laboratories were able to perform tests throughout the whole week . laboratory bio ##sa ##fe ##ty prepared ##ness included class ii bio ##sa ##fe ##ty cabinets ( 100 % ) ; separated pre - pc ##r , pc ##r , and post - pc ##r rooms ( 88 . 6 % ) ; negative pressure pre ##tre ##at ##ment rooms ( 48 . 6 % ) ; and negative pressure sp ##ut ##um collection rooms ( 20 . 0 % ) . conclusions : clinical laboratories were able to quickly expand their diagnostic capacity in response to the 2015 mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . our results show that clinical laboratories play an important role in the maintenance and enhancement of laboratory response in preparation for future emerging infections .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was detected by mono ##cl ##onal antibody - based nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein - capture enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , rna detection , and viral culture from the nasal sample of a 1 - month - old dr ##ome ##dar ##y calf in dubai with sudden death . whole genome ph ##yl ##ogen ##y showed that this mer ##s - co ##v strain did not cluster with the other mer ##s - co ##v strains from dubai that we reported recently . instead , it formed a unique branch more closely related to other mer ##s - co ##v strains from patients in qatar and ha ##fr - al - bat ##in in saudi arabia , as well as the mer ##s - co ##v strains from patients in the recent korean outbreak , in which the index patient acquired the infection during travel in the eastern part of the arabian peninsula . non - synonymous mutations , resulting in 11 unique amino acid differences , were observed between the mer ##s - co ##v genome from the present study and all the other available mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s . among these 11 unique amino acid differences , four were found in or ##f ##1 ##ab , three were found in the s ##1 domain of the spike protein , and one each was found in the proteins encoded by or ##f ##4 ##b , or ##f ##5 , envelope gene , and or ##f ##8 . mer ##s - co ##v detection for all other 254 dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in this closed dairy herd was negative by nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein - capture elisa and rna detection . mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg ser ##o - po ##sit ##ivity gradually increased in dr ##ome ##dar ##y calves with increasing age , with po ##sit ##ivity rates of 75 % at zero to three months , 79 % at four months , 89 % at five to six months , and 90 % at seven to twelve months . the development of a rapid antigen detection kit for instant ##aneous diagnosis is warrant ##ed .  
a middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak , the largest outbreak outside the middle east in 2012 , occurred in the republic of korea and resulted in a large number of cases , with 186 infected people , including 38 deaths . a rapid response team ( rr ##t ) was appointed after a request from the korean government on june 8 , 2015 calling for specialists to manage and control the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . this report presents the opinion of the rr ##t who worked to manage this healthcare - associated mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in korea .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an acute viral respiratory illness with high mortality caused by a new strain of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . since the report of the first patient in saudi arabia in 2012 , large - scale outbreak ##s through hospital - acquired infection and inter - hospital transmission have been reported . most of the patients reported in south korea were also infected in hospital settings . therefore , to eliminate the spread of mer ##s - co ##v , infection prevention and control measures should be implemented with rig ##or . the present guide ##line has been drafted on the basis of the experiences of infection control in the south korean hospitals involved in the recent mer ##s outbreak and on domestic and international infection prevention and control guidelines . to ensure efficient mer ##s - co ##v infection prevention and control , care should be taken to provide comprehensive infection control measures including contact control , hand hygiene , personal protective equipment , di ##sin ##fect ##ion , and environmental cleaning .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging human pathogen related to sar ##s virus . in vitro studies indicate this virus may have a broad host range suggesting an increased pan ##de ##mic potential . genetic and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological evidence indicate camel ##s serve as a reservoir for mer ##s virus but the mechanism of cross species transmission is unclear and many questions remain regarding the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of humans to infection . deep sequencing data was obtained from the nasal samples of three camel ##s that had been experimental ##ly infected with a human mer ##s - co ##v isolate . a majority of the genome was covered and average coverage was greater than 12 , 000 ##x depth . although only 5 mutations were detected in the consensus sequences , 47 ##3 intra ##hos ##t single nu ##cle ##otide variants were identified . many of these variants were present at high frequencies and could potentially influence viral ph ##eno ##type and the sensitivity of detection ass ##ays that target these regions for prime ##r or probe binding .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused a global panic due to its high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality during 2002 and 2003 . soon after the deadly disease outbreak , the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) was identified as a functional cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo for sar ##s - co ##v spike protein . however , ace ##2 solely is not sufficient to allow host cells to become susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection , and other host factors may be involved in sar ##s - co ##v spike protein - ace ##2 complex . results : a host intra ##cellular fi ##lam ##ent ##ous cy ##tos ##kel ##eta ##l protein vi ##ment ##in was identified by im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation and lc - ms / ms analysis following chemical cross - linking on ve ##ro e ##6 cells that were pre - inc ##uba ##ted with the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein . moreover , flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry data demonstrated an increase of the cell surface vi ##ment ##in level by 16 . 5 % after sar ##s - co ##v per ##missive ve ##ro e ##6 cells were treated with sar ##s - co ##v virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) . a direct interaction between sar ##s - co ##v spike protein and host surface vi ##ment ##in was further confirmed by far - western b ##lot ##ting . in addition , antibody neutral ##ization ass ##ay and sh ##rna knock ##down experiments indicated a vital role of vi ##ment ##in in cell binding and up ##take of sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s and the viral spike protein . conclusions : a direct interaction between vi ##ment ##in and sar ##s - co ##v spike protein during viral entry was observed . vi ##ment ##in is a put ##ative anti - viral drug target for preventing / reducing the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the large size of the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) genome ( around 30 kb ) and the instability in bacteria of pl ##as ##mi ##ds carrying co ##v replica ##se sequences , represent serious restrictions for the development of co ##v infectious clones using reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense rna viruses . to overcome these problems , several approaches have been established in the last thirteen years . here we describe the engineering of co ##v full - length cd ##na clones as bacterial artificial chromosomes ( ba ##cs ) , using the middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) as a model .  
during the 2015 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in korea , 186 persons were infected , resulting in 38 fatalities . we isolated mer ##s - co ##v from the oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sample obtained from a patient of the outbreak . cy ##top ##athic effects showing detachment and rounding of cells were observed in ve ##ro cell cultures 3 days after in ##oc ##ulation of the sample . spherical virus particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy . full - length genome sequence of the virus isolate was obtained and phylogenetic analyses showed that it clustered with clade b of mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus . although mer ##s - co ##v only emerged in 2012 , we and others have developed ass ##ays to grow and quan ##tify infectious mer ##s - co ##v and rna products of replication in vitro . mer ##s - co ##v is able to in ##fect a range of cell types , but replicate ##s to high ti ##ters in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . protocols for the propagation and quan ##ti ##fication of mer ##s - co ##v are presented .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a dangerous infection with pan ##de ##mic potential . it emerged in 2002 and its ae ##ti ##ological agent , the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , crossed the species barrier to in ##fect humans , showing high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality rates . no vaccines are currently licensed for sar ##s - co ##v and important efforts have been performed during the first outbreak to develop diagnostic tools . here we demonstrate the transient expression in nico ##tian ##a bent ##ham ##iana of two important antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts of the sar ##s - co ##v , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) and the membrane protein ( m ) using a virus - derived vector or ag ##ro - in ##filtration , respectively . for the m protein , this is the first description of production in plants , while for plant - derived n protein we demonstrate that it is recognized by sera of patients from the sar ##s outbreak in hong kong in 2003 . the availability of rec ##om ##bina ##nt n and m proteins from plants opens the way to further evaluation of their potential utility for the development of diagnostic and protection / therapy tools to be quickly manufactured , at low cost and with minimal risk , to face potential new highly infectious sar ##s - co ##v outbreak ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes life - threatening disease . dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) is the receptor for cell binding and entry . there is a need for small - animal models of mer ##s , but mice are not susceptible to mer ##s because mu ##rine d ##pp ##4 does not serve as a receptor . we developed trans ##genic mice expressing human d ##pp ##4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) under the control of the surf ##act ##ant protein c promoter or cy ##tok ##era ##tin 18 promoter that are susceptible to infection with mer ##s - co ##v . notably , mice expressing hd ##pp ##4 with the cy ##tok ##era ##tin 18 promoter developed progressive , uniformly fatal disease following intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation . high virus ti ##ters were present in lung and brain tissues 2 and 6 days after infection , respectively . mer ##s - co ##v – infected lungs revealed mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cell in ##filtration , al ##ve ##olar ed ##ema , and micro ##vas ##cular th ##rom ##bos ##is , with airways generally unaffected . brain disease was observed , with the greatest involvement noted in the tha ##lam ##us and brain stem . animals im ##mun ##ized with a vaccine candidate were uniformly protected from lethal infection . these new mouse models of mer ##s - co ##v should be useful for investigation of early disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an existent ##ial threat to global public health . the virus has been repeatedly detected in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ( camel ##us dr ##ome ##dar ##ius ) . adult animals in many countries in the middle east as well as in north and east africa showed high ( > 90 % ) ser ##o - prevalence to the virus . mer ##s - co ##v isolated from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies is genetically and ph ##eno ##typical ##ly similar to viruses from humans . we sum ##mar ##ise current understanding of the ecology of mer ##s - co ##v in animals and transmission at the animal - human interface . we review aspects of husband ##ry , animal movements and trade and the use and consumption of camel dairy and meat products in the middle east that may be relevant to the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s . we also highlight the gaps in understanding the transmission of this virus in animals and from animals to humans .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) highlights the zoo ##not ##ic potential of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . investigations into the origin of mer ##s - co ##v have focused on two potential reservoirs : bats and camel ##s . here , we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for mer ##s - co ##v . in vitro , the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein interact ##ed with jamaican fruit bat ( art ##ibe ##us jam ##ai ##cens ##is ) dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) receptor and mer ##s - co ##v replicate ##d efficiently in jamaican fruit bat cells , suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for mer ##s - co ##v . to shed light on the intrinsic host - virus relationship , we in ##oc ##ulated 10 jamaican fruit bats with mer ##s - co ##v . although all bats showed evidence of infection , none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease . virus shed ##ding was detected in the respiratory and int ##estinal tract for up to 9 days . mer ##s - co ##v replicate ##d transient ##ly in the respiratory and , to a lesser extent , the int ##estinal tracts and internal organs ; with limited his ##top ##ath ##ological changes observed only in the lungs . analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate , transient induction of expression . our results indicate that mer ##s - co ##v maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease , supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for mer ##s - co ##v .  
as of june 19 , 2015 , the world health organization had received 1 , 338 notification ##s of laboratory - confirmed infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . little is known about the course of or treatment for mer ##s - co ##v in pregnant women . we report a fatal case of mer ##s - co ##v in a pregnant woman administered combination rib ##avi ##rin – peg ##int ##er ##fer ##on - α therapy .  
the largest nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) occurred in south korea in 2015 . health care personnel ( hc ##p ) are at high risk of acquiring mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections , similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infections first identified in 2003 . this study described the similarities and differences in ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global mer ##s cases and 98 sar ##s cases in taiwan associated with hc ##p . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological findings showed that the mean age of mer ##s - hc ##p and total mer ##s cases were 40 ( 24 ~ 74 ) and 49 ( 2 ~ 90 ) years , respectively , much older than those in sar ##s [ sar ##s - hc ##p : 35 ( 21 ~ 68 ) years , p = 0 . 00 ##6 ; total sar ##s : 42 ( 0 ~ 94 ) years , p = 0 . 000 ##2 ] . the case fatal ##ity rates ( cf ##r ) was much lower in mer ##s - hc ##p [ 7 . 03 % ( 9 / 128 ) ] or sar ##s - hc ##p [ 12 . 24 % ( 12 / 98 ) ] than the mer ##s - non - hc ##p [ 36 . 96 % ( 34 / 92 ) , p < 0 . 001 ] or sar ##s - non - hc ##p [ 24 . 50 % ( 61 / 249 ) , p < 0 . 001 ] , however , no difference was found between mer ##s - hc ##p and sar ##s - hc ##p [ p = 0 . 181 ] . in terms of clinical period , the days from onset to death [ 13 ( 4 ~ 17 ) vs 14 . 5 ( 0 ~ 52 ) , p = 0 . 04 ##5 ] and to discharge [ 11 ( 5 ~ 24 ) vs 24 ( 0 ~ 74 ) , p = 0 . 01 ##0 ] and be hospitalized days [ 9 . 5 ( 3 ~ 22 ) vs 22 ( 0 ~ 69 ) , p = 0 . 04 ##0 ] were much shorter in mer ##s - hc ##p than sar ##s - hc ##p . similarly , days from onset to confirmation were shorter in mer ##s - hc ##p than mer ##s - non - hc ##p [ 6 ( 1 ~ 14 ) vs 10 ( 1 ~ 21 ) , p = 0 . 04 ##4 ] . in conclusion , the severity of mer ##s - hc ##p and sar ##s - hc ##p was lower than that of mer ##s - non - hc ##p and sar ##s - non - hc
for two months between may and july 2015 , a nationwide outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) occurred in korea . on june 3 , 2015 , the korean society for laboratory medicine ( ks ##lm ) launched a mer ##s - co ##v laboratory response task force ( l ##r - t ##f ) to facilitate clinical laboratories to set up the diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infection . based on the who interim recommendations , the centers for disease control and prevention of united states guidelines for mer ##s - co ##v laboratory testing , and other available resources , the ks ##lm mer ##s - co ##v l ##r - t ##f provided the first version of the laboratory practice guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v to the clinical laboratories on june 12 , 2015 . the guidelines described here are an updated version that includes case definition , indications for testing , specimen type and protocols for specimen collection , specimen packing and transport , specimen handling and nuclei ##c acid extraction , molecular detection of mer ##s - co ##v , interpretation of results and reporting , and laboratory safety . the ks ##lm guidelines mainly focus on the molecular diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v , reflecting the unique situation in korea and the state of knowledge at the time of publication .  
background : the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection outside middle east asia in 2015 has necessitated the rapid expansion of laboratories that conduct mer ##s - co ##v molecular testing in korea , together with external quality assessment ( e ##qa ) to evaluate the ass ##ays used . methods : the e ##qa program consisted of two phases ; self - validation and blind assessment . for the first e ##qa phase , in vitro transcribed upstream region of the envelope gene ( up ##e ) and the open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1a rna ##s were used at a concentration of 1 , 000 copies / µ ##l . the test panel for the second e ##qa phase consisted of rna extracts from three samples , which were obtained from two mer ##s - co ##v positive patients and one mer ##s - co ##v negative patient . results : the first e ##qa phase results for 46 participants showed a linear relationship between the threshold cycle ( c ( t ) ) values of rna materials and the log ##ari ##th ##mic concentrations for both up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a gene targets ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 73 and 0 . 75 , respectively ) . the mean c ( t ) value for each concentration was different depending on which commercial kit was used for the ass ##ay . among the three commonly used kits , power ##che ##k mer ##s real - time pc ##r kit ( ko ##gen ##eb ##iot ##ech , korea ) showed the lowest c ( t ) values at all concentrations of up ##e and most concentrations of or ##f ##1 ##a . the second e ##qa phase results for 47 participants were 100 % correct for all tested samples . conclusions : this e ##qa survey demonstrates that the mer ##s - co ##v molecular testing performed in korea during the 2015 outbreak is of robust capability . however , careful establishment and validation of a cut - off value are recommended to ensure good analytical sensitivity .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a viral respiratory disease . most people infected with mer ##s - co ##v develop severe acute respiratory illness . it was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries . we report the clinical course of mer ##s - co ##v infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trim ##ester . case presentation : the patient is a 33 - year - old female working as a critical care nurse . she was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a mer ##s - co ##v patient . although the patient was in respiratory failure , necessitated mechanical ventilation , and intensive care ( ic ##u ) admission , a healthy infant was delivered . the mother recovered . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case of a laboratory - confirmed middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus in a pregnant woman . conclusions : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) known to cause severe acute respiratory illness associated with a high risk of mortality various factors may have contributed to the successful outcome of this patient such as young age , presentation during the last stages of pregnancy , and possible differences in immune response .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are found in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals , and constitute a risk for zoo ##not ##ic and emerging infectious disease . in poultry , the genetic diversity , evolution , distribution and taxonomy of some corona ##virus ##es have been well described , but little is known about the features of co ##vs in wild birds . in this study we screened 76 ##4 samples from 22 av ##ian species of the orders an ##ser ##iform ##es and char ##ad ##ri ##iform ##es in sweden collected in 2006 / 2007 for co ##v , with an overall co ##v prevalence of 18 . 7 % , which is higher than many other wild bird surveys . the highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks — mainly greater sc ##au ##p ( a ##yt ##hya mari ##la ; 51 . 5 % ) — and the da ##bbling duck mall ##ard ( ana ##s pl ##at ##yr ##hy ##nch ##os ; 19 . 2 % ) . sequences from two of the greater sc ##au ##p co ##v fell into an in ##fr ##e ##quent ##ly detected lineage , shared only with a tu ##fted duck ( a ##yt ##hya fu ##li ##gul ##a ) co ##v . corona ##virus sequences from mall ##ards in this study were highly similar to co ##v sequences from the sample species and location in 2011 , suggesting long - term maintenance in this population . a single black - headed gu ##ll represented the only positive sample from the order char ##ad ##ri ##iform ##es . globally , ana ##s species represent the largest fraction of av ##ian co ##v sequences , and there seems to be no host species , geographical or temporal structure . to better understand the e ##iti ##ology , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected co ##v is imperative .  
the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes the conserved macro domain within non - structural protein 3 . however , the precise bio ##chemical function and structure of the macro domain is unclear . using differential scanning flu ##ori ##metry and iso ##thermal ti ##tra ##tion cal ##ori ##metry , we characterized the mer ##s - co ##v macro domain as a more efficient aden ##osi ##ne dip ##hos ##phate ( ad ##p ) - rib ##ose binding module than macro domains from other co ##vs . furthermore , the crystal structure of the mer ##s - co ##v macro domain was determined at 1 . 43 - a resolution in complex with ad ##p - rib ##ose . comparison of macro domains from mer ##s - co ##v and other human co ##vs revealed structural differences in the α ##1 helix alter ##s how the conserved as ##p - 20 interact ##s with ad ##p - rib ##ose and may explain the efficient binding of the mer ##s - co ##v macro domain to ad ##p - rib ##ose . this study provides structural and bio ##physical bases to further evaluate the role of the mer ##s - co ##v macro domain in the host response via ad ##p - rib ##ose binding but also as a potential target for drug design .  
first identified in the netherlands in 2004 , human corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 ( hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 ) was found to cause worldwide infections . patients infected by hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 are typically young children with upper and lower respiratory tract infection , presenting with symptoms including cr ##ou ##p , bro ##nch ##iol ##itis , and pneumonia . unfortunately , there are currently no effective anti ##vira ##l therapy to contain hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 infection . co ##v genome ##s en ##code an integral viral component , main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) , which is essential for viral replication through pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of rna replica ##se machinery . due to the sequence and structural conservation among all co ##vs , m ( pro ) has been recognized as an attractive molecular target for rational anti - co ##v drug design . here we present the crystal structure of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 m ( pro ) in complex with a michael accept ##or inhibitor n ##3 . structural analysis , consistent with bio ##chemical inhibition results , reveals the molecular mechanism of enzyme inhibition at the highly conservative substrate - recognition pocket . we show such molecular target remains unchanged across 30 clinical isolate ##s of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 strains . through comparative study with m ( pro ) s from other human co ##vs ( including the deadly sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v ) and their related zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs , our structure of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 m ( pro ) provides critical insight into rational development of wide spectrum anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s to treat infections caused by human co ##vs .  
background : mer ##s - co ##v is a newly emerged human corona ##virus reported closely related with hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 bat corona ##virus ##es . bat and mer ##s corona - viruses are structurally related . therefore , it is of interest to estimate the degree of conserved antigen ##ic sites among them . it is of importance to el ##uc ##ida ##te the shared antigen ##ic - sites and extent of conservation between them to understand the evolutionary dynamics of mer ##s - co ##v . results : multiple sequence alignment of the spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) , enveloped ( e ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins was employed to identify the sequence conservation among mer ##s and bat ( hk ##u ##4 , hk ##u ##5 ) corona ##virus ##es . we used various in si ##lic ##o tools to predict the conserved antigen ##ic sites . we found that mer ##s - co ##v shared 30 % of its s protein antigen ##ic sites with hk ##u ##4 and 70 % with hk ##u ##5 bat - co ##v . whereas 100 % of its e , m and n protein ’ s antigen ##ic sites are found to be conserved with those in hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 . conclusion : this sharing suggests that in case of pathogen ##ici ##ty mer ##s - co ##v is more closely related to hk ##u ##5 bat - co ##v than hk ##u ##4 bat - co ##v . the conserved ep ##ito ##pes indicates their evolutionary relationship and ancestry of pathogen ##ici ##ty . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##13 ##0 ##29 - 01 ##6 - 00 ##49 - 7 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , an emerging infectious disease caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has garnered worldwide attention as a consequence of its continuous spread and pan ##de ##mic potential , making the development of effective vaccines a high priority . we previously demonstrated that residues 37 ##7 – 58 ##8 of mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) is a very promising mer ##s subunit vaccine candidate , capable of inducing potent neutral ##ization antibody responses . in this study , we sought to identify an ad ##ju ##vant that optimal ##ly enhanced the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of s ##37 ##7 – 58 ##8 protein fused with fc of human i ##gg ( s ##37 ##7 – 58 ##8 - fc ) . specifically , we compared several commercially available ad ##ju ##vant ##s , including fr ##eu ##nd ' s ad ##ju ##vant , aluminum , mono ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##l lip ##id a , mont ##ani ##de isa ##51 and m ##f ##59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of this subunit vaccine . in the absence of ad ##ju ##vant , s ##37 ##7 – 58 ##8 - fc alone induced readily detect ##able neutral ##izing antibody and t - cell responses in im ##mun ##ized mice . however , incorporating an ad ##ju ##vant improved its im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . particularly , among the aforementioned ad ##ju ##vant ##s evaluated , m ##f ##59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest ti ##ters of i ##gg , i ##gg ##1 and i ##gg ##2 ##a sub ##type ##s , and neutral ##izing antibodies . the addition of m ##f ##59 significantly augmented the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of s ##37 ##7 – 58 ##8 - fc to induce strong i ##gg and neutral ##izing antibody responses as well as protection against mer ##s - co ##v infection in mice , suggesting that m ##f ##59 is an optimal ad ##ju ##vant for mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - based subunit vaccines .  
the outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is reported from saudi arabia and the republic of korea . it is a respiratory disease caused by corona ##virus . camel ##s are considered as a source for mer ##s transmission in humans , although the exact source is unknown . human - to - human transmission is reported in the community with drop ##let and contact spread being the possible modes . most patients without any underlying diseases remain as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or develop mild clinical disease , but some patients require critical care for mechanical ventilation , dial ##ysis and other organ support . mer ##s is a disease with pan ##de ##mic potential and awareness , and surveillance can prevent such further outbreak ##s .  
not all persons infected with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) develop severe symptoms , which likely leads to an under ##est ##ima ##tion of the number of people infected and an over ##est ##ima ##tion of the severity . to estimate the number of mer ##s - co ##v infections that have occurred in the kingdom of saudi arabia , we applied a statistical model to a line list describing 72 ##1 mer ##s - co ##v infections detected between june 7 , 2012 , and july 25 , 2014 . we estimated that 1 , 52 ##8 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 1 , 327 , 1 , 88 ##3 ) mer ##s - co ##v infections occurred in this interval , which is 2 . 1 ( 95 % ci : 1 . 8 , 2 . 6 ) times the number reported . the probability of developing symptoms ranged from 11 % ( 95 % ci : 4 , 25 ) in persons under 10 years of age to 88 % ( 95 % ci : 72 , 97 ) in those 70 years of age or older . an estimated 22 % ( 95 % ci : 18 , 25 ) of those infected with mer ##s - co ##v died . mer ##s - co ##v is deadly , but this work shows that its clinical severity differs markedly between groups and that many cases likely go und ##ia ##gno ##sed .  
in 2012 , an outbreak of infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , was detected in the arabian peninsula . modeling can produce estimates of the expected annual number of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection exported and the likelihood of export ##ation from source countries in the middle east to countries outside the region .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections sharply increased in the arabian peninsula during spring 2014 . in abu dhabi , united arab emirates , these infections occurred primarily among healthcare workers and patients . to identify and describe ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic and clinical characteristics of persons with healthcare - associated infection , we reviewed laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases reported to the health authority of abu dhabi during january 1 , 2013 – may 9 , 2014 . of 65 case - patients identified with mer ##s - co ##v infection , 27 ( 42 % ) had healthcare - associated cases . ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic and genetic sequencing findings suggest that 3 healthcare clusters of mer ##s - co ##v infection occurred , including 1 that resulted in 20 infected persons in 1 hospital . mer ##s - co ##v in healthcare settings spread predominantly before mer ##s - co ##v infection was diagnosed , under ##sco ##ring the importance of increasing awareness and infection control measures at first points of entry to healthcare facilities .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel enzo ##otic beta ##cor ##ona ##virus that was first described in september 2012 . the clinical spectrum of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans ranges from an as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi - organ failure ; overall mortality is around 35 . 7 % . bats harbour several beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es that are closely related to mer ##s - co ##v but more research is needed to establish the relationship between bats and mer ##s - co ##v . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies is very high in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in eastern africa and the arabian peninsula . mer ##s - co ##v rna and viable virus have been isolated from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , including some with respiratory symptoms . furthermore , near - identical strains of mer ##s - co ##v have been isolated from ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly linked humans and camel ##s , confirming inter - transmission , most probably from camel ##s to humans . though inter - human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported mer ##s - co ##v cases , the virus is incapable at present of causing sustained human - to - human transmission . clusters can be readily controlled with implementation of appropriate infection control procedures . phylogenetic and sequencing data strongly suggest that mer ##s - co ##v originated from bat ancestors after undergoing a rec ##om ##bina ##tion event in the spike protein , possibly in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in africa , before its export ##ation to the arabian peninsula along the camel trading routes . mer ##s - co ##v ser ##os ##ur ##vey ##s are needed to investigate possible un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed human infections in africa . amongst the important measures to control mer ##s - co ##v spread are strict regulation of camel movement , regular herd screening and isolation of infected camel ##s , use of personal protective equipment by camel handler ##s and enforcing rules banning all consumption of un ##pas ##te ##urized camel milk and urine .  
a 68 - year old man diagnosed with middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) presented with multiple p ##ne ##um ##onic in ##filtration ##s on his chest x - ray , and the patient was placed on a mechanical vent ##ila ##tor because of progressive respiratory failure . ur ##ina ##ry protein ex ##cre ##tion steadily increased for a micro ##al ##bu ##min to cr ##ea ##tin ##ine ratio of 53 ##8 . 4 mg / g cr and a protein to cr ##ea ##tin ##ine ratio of 3 , 02 ##5 . 8 mg / g cr . the isotope dil ##ution mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry trace ##able serum cr ##ea ##tin ##ine level increased to 3 . 0 mg / dl . we performed a kidney bio ##psy 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms . acute tubular nec ##rosis was the main finding , and protein ##aceous cast formation and acute tub ##ulo ##int ##ers ##ti ##tial ne ##ph ##rit ##is were found . there were no electron dense deposits observed with electron microscopy . we could not verify the virus itself by in situ hybrid ##ization and con ##fo ##cal microscopy ( mer ##s - co ##v co - stained with dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ) . the vi ##rem ##ic status , ur ##ina ##ry virus ex ##cre ##tion , and timely kidney bio ##psy results should be investigated with thorough precautions to reveal the direct effects of mer ##s - co ##v with respect to renal complications .  
the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate ( ~ 35 % ) . mer ##s - co ##v has been a global threat due to continuous outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula and international spread by infected travelers since 2012 . from may to july 2015 , a large outbreak initiated by an infected traveler from the arabian peninsula swept south korea and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths ( case fatal ##ity rate , 20 . 4 % ) . here , we show the rapid emergence and spread of a mutant mer ##s - co ##v with reduced affinity to the human cd ##26 receptor during the south korean outbreak . we isolated 13 new viral genome ##s from 14 infected patients treated at a hospital and found that 12 of these genome ##s possess a point mutation in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of viral spike ( s ) protein . specifically , 11 of these genome ##s have an i ##52 ##9 ##t mutation in rb ##d , and 1 has a d ##51 ##0 ##g mutation . striking ##ly , both mutations result in reduced affinity of rb ##d to human cd ##26 compared to wild - type rb ##d , as measured by surface pl ##as ##mon resonance analysis and cellular binding ass ##ay . additionally , pseudo ##type ##d virus bearing an i ##52 ##9 ##t mutation in s protein showed reduced entry into host cells compared to virus with wild - type s protein . these unexpected findings suggest that mer ##s - co ##v adaptation during human - to - human spread may be driven by host im ##mun ##ological pressure such as neutral ##izing antibodies , resulting in reduced affinity to host receptor , and thereby imp ##air ##s viral fitness and vi ##ru ##lence , rather than positive selection for a better affinity to cd ##26 .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is the first highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus to emerge since severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 . like many corona ##virus ##es , mer ##s - co ##v carries genes that en ##code multiple accessory proteins that are not required for replication of the genome but are likely involved in pathogen ##esis . eva ##sion of host innate immunity through inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) ant ##ago ##nism is a critical component of viral pathogen ##esis . the if ##n - ind ##ucible ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late synth ##eta ##se ( o ##as ) - rna ##se l pathway activate ##s upon sensing of viral double - stranded rna ( ds ##rna ) . activated rna ##se l cl ##ea ##ves viral and host single - stranded rna ( ssr ##na ) , which leads to translation ##al arrest and subsequent cell death , preventing viral replication and spread . here we report that mer ##s - co ##v , a lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , and related bat co ##v ns ##4 ##b accessory proteins have ph ##os ##ph ##odies ##tera ##se ( pd ##e ) activity and ant ##ago ##ni ##ze o ##as - rna ##se l by en ##zy ##matic ##ally de ##grad ##ing 2 ′ , 5 ′ - ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late ( 2 - 5 ##a ) , act ##iva ##tors of rna ##se l . this is a novel function for ns ##4 ##b , which has previously been reported to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze if ##n signaling . ns ##4 ##b proteins are distinct from lineage a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus pd ##es and rot ##avi ##rus gene - encoded pd ##es , in having an amino - terminal nuclear local ##ization signal ( nl ##s ) and are localized mostly to the nucleus . however , the expression level of cy ##top ##las ##mic mer ##s - co ##v ns ##4 ##b protein is sufficient to prevent activation of rna ##se l . finally , this is the first report of an rna ##se l antagonist expressed by a human or bat corona ##virus and provides a specific mechanism by which this occurs . our findings provide a potential mechanism for eva ##sion of innate immunity by mer ##s - co ##v while also identifying a potential target for therapeutic intervention .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak in korea in 2015 may be at ##tri ##bu ##table to poor nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control procedures implemented . strict infection control measures were taken in the hospital where an imported case with mer ##s was treated in southern china and 53 health care workers were confirmed to be mer ##s - co ##v negative . infection control in healthcare settings , in which patients with emerging infectious diseases such as mer ##s , e ##bola virus disease , and the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) are diagnosed and treated , are often imperfect . when it comes to emerging or unknown infectious diseases , before the imported case was finally identified or community transmission was reported , cases have often occurred in clusters in healthcare settings . nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control measures should be further strengthened among the workers and in ##patient ##s in designated healthcare settings that accommodate suspected cases suffering from emerging or unknown infectious diseases . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##40 ##24 ##9 - 01 ##6 - 01 ##18 - 9 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) highlights the need to engineer new methods for ex ##ped ##iting vaccine development against emerging diseases . however , several obstacles prevent pursuit of a li ##cens ##able mer ##s vaccine . first , the lack of a suitable animal model for mer ##s com ##pl ##icate ##s in vivo testing of candidate vaccines . second , due to the low number of mer ##s cases , pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pursue mer ##s vaccine production as the costs of clinical trials are high . in addition , the timeline from bench research to approved vaccine use is 10 years or longer . using novel methods and cost - saving strategies , genetically engineered vaccines can be produced quickly and cost - effectively . along with progress in mer ##s animal model development , these obstacles can be ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##ed or at least mit ##igate ##d .  
background : in april 2012 , the jordan ministry of health investigated an outbreak of lower respiratory illnesses at a hospital in jordan ; 2 fatal cases were retrospective ##ly confirmed by real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) to be the first detected cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . methods : ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic and clinical characteristics of selected potential cases were assessed through serum blood specimens , medical record reviews , and interviews with surviving outbreak members , household contacts , and healthcare personnel . cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection were identified using 3 us centers for disease control and prevention ser ##olo ##gic tests for detection of anti – mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . results : specimens and interviews were obtained from 124 subjects . seven previously un ##con ##firmed individuals tested positive for anti – mer ##s - co ##v antibodies by at least 2 of 3 ser ##olo ##gic tests , in addition to 2 fatal cases identified by rr ##t - pc ##r . the case - fatal ##ity rate among the 9 total cases was 22 % . six subjects were healthcare workers at the outbreak hospital , yielding an attack rate of 10 % among potentially exposed outbreak hospital personnel . there was no evidence of mer ##s - co ##v transmission at 2 transfer hospitals having acceptable infection control practices . conclusions : novel ser ##olo ##gic tests allowed for the detection of otherwise un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection among contacts in a jordanian hospital - associated respiratory illness outbreak in april 2012 , resulting in a total of 9 test - positive cases . ser ##olo ##gic results suggest that further spread of this outbreak to transfer hospitals did not occur . most subjects had no major , underlying medical conditions ; none were on hem ##od ##ial ##ysis . our observed case - fatal ##ity rate was lower than has been reported from outbreak ##s elsewhere .  
the recent outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in korea was unexpected that laboratory response had to be built up urgently during the outbreak . the outbreak was almost all healthcare - associated , which was aggravated by lack of availability in laboratory diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v on site . on behalf of the mer ##s joint public and private sector response committee ( mer ##s joint committee ) , the korean society for laboratory medicine ( ks ##lm ) launched a mer ##s response task force ( mer ##s ks ##lm t ##f ) to facilitate clinical laboratories set up mer ##s molecular diagnosis . mer ##s t ##f established guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v and provided it to all participating laboratories as the official guidance of mer ##s joint committee . this guide ##line was used for procedure manual of molecular diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v and laboratory safety manual .  
protein nat ##ivity is one of the most critical factors for the quality of antigen ##s used as im ##mun ##ogen ##s and the react ##iv ##ities of the resultant antibodies . the preparation and purification of native viral antigen ##s in conventional cell - based protein expression systems are often accompanied by technical hardship ##s . these challenges are at ##tri ##bu ##table mainly to protein aggregation and ins ##ol ##ub ##ility during expression and purification , as well as to very low expression levels associated with the toxicity of some viral proteins . here , we describe a novel approach for the production of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . using a wheat ge ##rm cell - free protein synthesis system , we successfully prepared large amounts of mer ##s - co ##v np antigen in a state that was highly soluble and intact for im ##mun ##ization . following mouse im ##mun ##ization and hybrid ##oma generation , we selected seven hybrid ##oma clones that produced mab ##s with exclusive react ##ivity against mer ##s - co ##v np . ep ##ito ##pe mapping and subsequent bio ##in ##form ##atic analysis revealed that these mab ##s recognized ep ##ito ##pes located within relatively highly conserved regions of the mer ##s - co ##v amino - acid sequence . consistently , the mab ##s exhibited no obvious cross - react ##ivity with np ##s derived from other related viruses , including sar ##s corona ##virus . after determining the optimal combinations of these mab ##s , we developed an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay and a rapid im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic antigen detection test that can be re ##lia ##bly used for laboratory diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v . thus , this study provides strong evidence that the wheat ge ##rm cell - free system is useful for the production of diagnostic mab ##s against emerging pathogen ##s .  
with > 1600 documented human infections with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and a case fatal ##ity rate of approximately 36 % , medical counter ##me ##as ##ures are needed to prevent and limit the disease . we examined the in vivo efficacy of the human mono ##cl ##onal antibody m3 ##36 , which has high neutral ##izing activity against mer ##s - co ##v in vitro . m3 ##36 was administered to rabbits intra ##ven ##ously or intra ##nas ##ally before infection with mer ##s - co ##v . prop ##hyl ##ax ##is with m3 ##36 resulted in a reduction of pulmonary viral rna ti ##ters by 40 – 900 ##0 - fold , compared with an irrelevant control antibody with little to no inflammation or viral antigen detected . this protection in rabbits supports further clinical development of m3 ##36 .  
background : middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a poorly understood disease with no known treatments . we describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed mer ##s - co ##v at a regional refer ##ral center in the kingdom of saudi arabia . methods : in 2014 , a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death . con ##fo ##und ##ing was evaluated and a multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered . results : fifty - one patients had an overall mortality of 37 % . most patients were male ( 78 % ) with a mean age of 54 years . almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers ( 23 . 5 % ) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with mer ##s - co ##v . survival was associated with male gender , working as a healthcare worker , history of hyper ##tension , vomiting on admission , elevated respiratory rate , abnormal lung exam , elevated alan ##ine trans ##amina ##se ( alt ) , clearance of mer ##s - co ##v on repeat pc ##r polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) testing , and my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late mo ##fe ##ti ##l treatment . survival was reduced in the presence of corona ##ry artery disease , h ##yp ##ote ##ns ##ion , h ##yp ##ox ##emia , c ##x ##r ( chest x - ray ) abnormalities , le ##uk ##oc ##yt ##osis , cr ##ea ##tin ##ine > 1 · 5 mg / dl , th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia , an ##emia , and renal failure . in a multi ##var ##iate analysis of treatments administered , severity of illness was the greatest predict ##or of reduced survival . conclusions : care for patients with mer ##s - co ##v remains a challenge . in this retrospective co ##hort , inter ##fer ##on beta and my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late mo ##fe ##ti ##l treatment were predict ##ors of increased survival in the un ##ivar ##iate analysis . severity of illness was the greatest predict ##or of reduced survival in the multi ##var ##iate analysis . larger random ##ized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regime ##ns for mer ##s - co ##v .  
[ image : see text ] the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) blocking loop 2 ( b ##l ##2 ) structure differs significantly from that of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , where it has been proven to play a crucial role in sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro inhibitor binding . four sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro lead inhibitors were tested against mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , none of which were effective against mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . structure and sequence alignment ##s revealed that two residues , y ##26 ##9 and q ##27 ##0 , responsible for inhibitor binding to sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , were replaced by t ##27 ##4 and a2 ##75 in mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , making critical binding interactions difficult to form for similar types of inhibitors . high - through ##put screening ( h ##ts ) of 25 000 compounds against both pl ##pro enzymes identified a small fragment - like non ##co ##valent dual inhibitor . mode of inhibition studies by enzyme kinetic ##s and competition surface pl ##as ##mon resonance ( sp ##r ) analyses suggested that this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor with an ic ( 50 ) of 6 μ ##m against mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , indicating that it binds to the active site , whereas it acts as an all ##ost ##eric inhibitor against sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro with an ic ( 50 ) of 11 μ ##m . these results raised the possibility that inhibitor recognition specific ##ity of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro may differ from that of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . in addition , inhibitor ##y activity of this compound was selective for sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro enzymes over two human homo ##logue ##s , the u ##bi ##qui ##tin c - terminal hydro ##lase ##s 1 and 3 ( hu ##ch - l ##1 and hu ##ch - l ##3 ) .  
we generated the near - full genome sequence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from a collected nasal sample of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel in egypt . the newly characterized egyptian strain has high similarity to the previously characterized egyptian virus and both of viruses fell into a cluster distinct from other mer ##s - co ##vs .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in saudi arabia in 2012 . the ability of mer ##s - co ##v to evade the host innate anti ##vira ##l response may contribute to its severe pathogen ##esis . many mer ##s - co ##v - encoded proteins were identified to have inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - ant ##ago ##ni ##zing properties , which co ##rre ##lates well with the reduced if ##n levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models . in this study , we fully characterized the if ##n - ant ##ago ##ni ##zing property of the mer ##s - co ##v m protein . expression of mer ##s - co ##v m protein suppressed type i if ##n expression in response to send ##ai virus infection or poly ( i : c ) induction . this suppress ##ive effect was found to be specific for the activation of if ##n regulatory factor 3 ( ir ##f ##3 ) but not nuclear factor - κ ##b . mer ##s - co ##v m protein interact ##ed with tr ##af ##3 and disrupted tr ##af ##3 – tb ##k ##1 association leading to reduced ir ##f ##3 activation . m proteins from mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v have three highly similar conserved n - terminal trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains and a c - terminal region . using chi ##meric and tr ##un ##cation mutants , the n - terminal trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains of the mer ##s - co ##v m protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitor ##y effect on if ##n expression , whereas the c - terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression . collectively , our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogen ##ic mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v harness their m proteins to suppress type i if ##n expression at the level of tb ##k ##1 - dependent ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and activation of ir ##f ##3 resulting in eva ##sion of the host innate anti ##vira ##l response .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) belongs to beta group of corona ##virus and was first discovered in 2012 . mer ##s - co ##v can in ##fect multiple host species and cause severe diseases in human . we conducted a series of phylogenetic and bio ##in ##form ##atic analyses to study the evolution dynamics of mer ##s - co ##v among different host species with gen ##omic data . our analyses show : 1 ) 28 potential rec ##om ##bina ##nt sequences were detected and they can be classified into seven potential rec ##om ##bina ##nt types ; 2 ) the spike ( s ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v was under strong positive selection when mer ##s - co ##v transmitted from their natural host to human ; 3 ) six out of nine positive selection sites detected in spike ( s ) protein are located in its receptor - binding domain which is in direct contact with host cells ; 4 ) mer ##s - co ##v frequently transmitted back and forth between human and camel after it had acquired the human - camel infection capability . together , these results suggest that potential rec ##om ##bina ##tion events might have happened frequently during mer ##s - co ##v ’ s evolutionary history and the positive selection sites in mer ##s - co ##v ’ s s protein might enable it to in ##fect human .  
the worldwide outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was due to the transmission of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) of sar ##s - co ##v is essential for the viral life cycle , and is considered to be an attractive target of anti - sar ##s drug development . as a key enzyme for pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of viral poly ##pro ##tein ##s to produce functional non - structure proteins , m ( pro ) is first auto - cl ##ea ##ved out of poly ##pro ##tein ##s . the mono ##meric form of m ( pro ) is en ##zy ##matic ##ally inactive , and it is activated through homo - dime ##rization which is strongly affected by extra residues to both ends of the mature enzyme . this review provides a summary of the related literature ##s on the study of the qu ##ater ##nary structure , activation , and self - mat ##uration of m ( pro ) over the past years .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus with pathogen ##ic mechanisms that may be driven by innate immune pathways . the goal of this study is to character ##ize the expression of the structural ( s , e , m , n ) and accessory ( or ##f 3 , or ##f 4a , or ##f 4 ##b , or ##f 5 ) proteins of mer ##s - co ##v and to determine whether any of these proteins acts as an inter ##fer ##on antagonist . individual structural and accessory protein - coding pl ##as ##mi ##ds with an n - terminal ha tag were constructed and transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed into cells , and their native expression and sub ##cellular local ##ization were assessed using wes ter ##n b ##lot ##ting and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence . while or ##f 4 ##b demonstrated major ##ly nuclear local ##ization , all of the other proteins demonstrated cy ##top ##las ##mic local ##ization . in addition , for the first time , our experiments revealed that the m , or ##f 4a , or ##f 4 ##b , and or ##f 5 proteins are potent inter ##fer ##on antagonist ##s . further examination revealed that the or ##f 4a protein of mer ##s - co ##v has the most potential to counter ##act the anti ##vira ##l effects of if ##n via the inhibition of both the inter ##fer ##on production ( if ##n - β promoter activity , ir ##f - 3 / 7 and n ##f - κ ##b activation ) and is ##re promoter element signaling pathways . together , our results provide new insights into the function and pathogen ##ic role of the structural and accessory proteins of mer ##s - co ##v .  
introduction : a hospital - associated outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was reported . we aimed to assess the effectiveness of infection control measures among healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) who were exposed to a mer ##s patient and / or his body fluids in our institute . methods : a descriptive study was conducted among hc ##ws who worked with a mer ##s patient in bam ##ras ##nar ##ad ##ura infectious diseases institute , thailand , between 18 june and 3 july 2015 . contacts were defined as hc ##ws who worked in the patient ’ s room or with the patient ’ s body fluids . serum samples from all contacts were collected within 14 days of last contact and one month later . paired sera were tested for detection of mer ##s ‐ co ##v antibodies by using an indirect elisa . results : thirty - eight ( 88 . 4 % ) of 43 identified contacts consent ##ed to enroll . the mean ( sd ) age was 38 . 1 ( 11 . 1 ) years , and 79 % were females . the median ( iq ##r ) cumulative duration of work of hc ##ws in the patient ’ s room was 35 ( 20 – 165 ) minutes . the median ( iq ##r ) cumulative duration of work of hc ##ws with the patient ’ s blood or body fluids in laboratory was 67 . 5 ( 43 . 7 – 117 . 5 ) minutes . all contacts reported 100 % compliance with hand hygiene , using n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator , performing res ##pi ##rator fit test , wearing gown , gloves , eye protection , and cap during their entire working period . all serum specimens of contacts tested for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies were negative . conclusions : we provide evidence of effective infection control practices against mer ##s - co ##v transmission in a healthcare facility . strict infection control precautions can protect hc ##ws . the optimal infection control measures for mer ##s - co ##v should be further evaluated .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in africa and elsewhere carry the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . to search for evidence of auto ##cht ##hon ##ous mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans , we tested archived serum from livestock handler ##s in kenya for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . ser ##olo ##gic evidence of infection was confirmed for 2 persons sampled in 2013 and 2014 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) reportedly inhibit ##s the production of type i inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) and pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines in toll - like receptor 3 ( t ##lr ##3 ) and re ##tino ##ic acid - ind ##ucible gene 1 ( rig - i ) pathways . the study investigated the inhibitor ##y effect and its antagonist ##ic mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro on t ##lr ##7 - mediated cy ##tok ##ine production . t ##lr ##7 ago ##nist ( im ##iq ##ui ##mo ##d ( im ##q ) ) concentration - dependent ##ly induced activation of is ##re - , n ##f - κ ##b - and ap - 1 - lucifer ##ase reporters , as well as the production of if ##n - α , if ##n - β , tn ##f - α , il - 6 and il - 8 in human promo ##no ##cy ##te cells . however , sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro significantly inhibit ##ed im ##q - induced cy ##tok ##ine production through suppress ##ing the activation of transcription factors ir ##f - 3 , n ##f - κ ##b and ap - 1 . western b ##lot analysis with anti - l ##ys ##48 and anti - l ##ys ##6 ##3 u ##bi ##qui ##tin antibodies indicated the sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro removed l ##ys ##6 ##3 - linked u ##bi ##qui ##tin chains of tr ##af ##3 and tr ##af ##6 , but not l ##ys ##48 - linked u ##bi ##qui ##tin chains in un - treated and treated cells . the decrease in the activated state of tr ##af ##3 and tr ##af ##6 correlated with the ina ##ct ##ivation of tb ##k ##1 in response to im ##q by pl ##pro . the results revealed that the ant ##ago ##nism of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro on t ##lr ##7 - mediated innate immunity was associated with the negative regulation of tr ##af ##3 / 6 - tb ##k ##1 - ir ##f ##3 / n ##f - κ ##b / ap ##1 signals .  
only a few reports have been published on women with an infectious respiratory viral pathogen , such as middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus delivering a baby . a laboratory confirmed case of mer ##s was reported during a mer ##s outbreak in the republic of korea in a woman at ge ##station ##al week 35 + 4 . she recovered , and delivered a healthy baby by emergency cesare ##an section ( c - sec ) . we present the clinical course and the emergency c - sec in a pregnant woman with mer ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans . though not confirmed yet , multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin . the disease is heavily endemic in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel populations of east africa and the middle east . it is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , but data from studies that investigated stored dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s several decades ago . though bats and al ##pac ##as can serve as potential reservoirs for mer ##s - co ##v , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a virus that causes severe viral pneumonia in humans , known to have a high mortality rate and a similarity in clinical symptoms with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus . it was first isolated in kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) in 2012 and after that , mer ##s - co ##v exhibited outbreak ##s in several regions of the world . this study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving mer ##s - co ##v at global level by using a bi ##bl ##iom ##et ##ric analysis . methods : sc ##opus database was searched on march 4 , 2016 for mer ##s - co ##v publications published between 2012 and 2015 . it was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metric ##s are changing over time . all publication types were considered ; however publications as er ##rata were excluded . analysis parameters include year of publication , publication type , patterns of international collaboration , research institutions , journals , impact factor , h - index , language , and times cited . results : a total of 88 ##3 mer ##s - co ##v research publications were published across the world . the mer ##s - co ##v - associated publications were originated from 92 countries / territories , indicating the international spread of mer ##s - co ##v research . the usa was the largest contributor , with 319 articles published over 4 years , followed by ks ##a ( 113 articles ) . the total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8 , 01 ##5 , with an average of 9 . 01 citations per each publication . the h - index for mer ##s - co ##v - associated publications was 48 . the usa also have the highest h - index ( 32 ) , followed by ks ##a ( 26 ) and uk ( 22 ) . net ##her ##land produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration ( 72 . 7 % ) followed by the uk ( 71 % ) and germany ( 69 . 1 % ) out of the total number of publications for each country . conclusions : there is a rapid increase in research activities related to mer ##s - co ##v from 2012 to 2015 . this study demonstrates that the mer ##s - co ##v related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years . the bulk of publications in the field of mer ##s - co ##v research are published by high - income countries such as the usa . furthermore , the usa , the uk and ks ##a may have higher quality of articles according to the value of h - index .  
in january 2013 , several months after middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in saudi arabia , abu dhabi , united arab emirates , began surveillance for mer ##s - co ##v . we analyzed medical chart and laboratory data collected by the health authority – abu dhabi during january 2013 – may 2014 . using real - time reverse transcription pc ##r , we tested respiratory tract samples for mer ##s - co ##v and identified 65 case - patients . of these patients , 23 ( 35 % ) were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic at the time of testing , and 4 ( 6 % ) showed positive test results for > 3 weeks ( 1 had severe symptoms and 3 had mild symptoms ) . we also identified 6 clusters of mer ##s - co ##v cases . this report highlights the potential for virus shed ##ding by mildly ill and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case - patients . these findings will be useful for mer ##s - co ##v management and infection prevention strategies .  
pre ##cl ##ini ##cal development of and research on potential middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) medical counter ##me ##as ##ures remain preliminary ; advancement ##s are needed before most counter ##me ##as ##ures are ready to be tested in human clinical trials . research priorities include standardization of animal models and virus stocks for studying disease pathogen ##esis and efficacy of medical counter ##me ##as ##ures ; development of mer ##s - co ##v diagnostic ##s ; improved access to non ##hum ##an primate ##s to support pre ##cl ##ini ##cal research ; studies to better understand and control mer ##s - co ##v disease , including va ##cci ##nation studies in camel ##s ; and development of a standardized clinical trial protocol . partnering with clinical trial networks in affected countries to evaluate safety and efficacy of investigation ##al therapeutic ##s will strengthen efforts to identify successful medical counter ##me ##as ##ures .  
background : bats have been implicated as the main reservoir of corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . thus the role of these hosts on the evolution and spread of co ##vs currently deserve the attention of emerging diseases surveillance programs . on the view of the interest on and importance of co ##vs in bats the occurrence and molecular characterization of co ##v were conducted in bats from brazil . findings : three hundred five enter ##ic contents of 29 bat species were tested using a pan ##co ##v nest ##ed rt - pc ##r . nine specimens were positive and eight was suitable for rd ##rp gene sequencing . rd ##rp gene ph ##yl ##ogen ##y showed that all co ##vs strains from this study cluster in alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus genus , with one mo ##los ##si ##dae and one ph ##ly ##llo ##sto ##mi ##dae - co ##v specific groups . phylogenetic analyses of two s gene sequences showed a large diversity within the alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus genus . conclusions : this study indicated a co ##v - to - host specific ##ity and draws attention for co ##v detection in cy ##no ##mo ##ps sp , a potential new reservoir . the phylogenetic analyses indicate that diversity of co ##v in bats is higher than previously known .  
background : during the 2015 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , six different commercial mer ##s - co ##v rna detection kits based on real - time reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) were available in korea . we performed analytical and clinical validation ##s of these kits . methods : power ##che ##k ( ko ##gen ##e bio ##tech , korea ) , dia ##plex ##q ( sol ##gent , korea ) , any ##plex ( see ##gen ##e , korea ) , acc ##up ##ower ( bio ##neer , korea ) , light ##mi ##x ( roche molecular diagnostic ##s , switzerland ) , and ultra ##fast kits ( nano ##bio ##sy ##s , korea ) were evaluated . limits of detection ( lo ##d ) with 95 % probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicate ##s of upstream of the envelope gene ( up ##e ) and open reading frame 1a ( or ##f ##1 ##a ) rna transcript ##s . specific ##ity was estimated by using 28 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s that were positive for other respiratory viruses . clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens . the sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each , including eight and six specimens that were positive for mer ##s - co ##v , respectively . results : the lo ##ds for up ##e ranged from 21 . 88 to 263 . 03 copies / reaction , and those for or ##f ##1 ##a ranged from 6 . 92 to 128 . 82 copies / reaction . no cross - react ##ivity with other respiratory viruses was found . all six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 ( 100 % ) positive clinical specimens . based on results from the high inhibition panel , power ##che ##k and acc ##up ##ower were the least sensitive to the presence of pc ##r inhibition . conclusions : the overall sensitivity and specific ##ity of all six ass ##ay systems were sufficient for dia ##gno ##sing mer ##s - co ##v infection . however , the analytical sensitivity and detection ability in specimens with pc ##r inhibition could be improved with the use of appropriate internal controls .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging respiratory pathogen with a high mortality rate and no specific treatments available to date . the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a random ##ized controlled trial ( rc ##t ) of con ##vale ##scent plasma therapy for mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients by using mer ##s - co ##v - specific con ##vale ##scent plasma obtained from previously recovered patients . methods : a survey was adapted from valid ##ated question ##naire originally aimed to measure network capacities and capabilities within the international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium ( isa ##ric ) . the question ##naire was modified for this study to include 26 items that were divided into three main domains of interest : ( 1 ) the ability to care for critically ill mer ##s - co ##v patients ; ( 2 ) laboratory capacity to dia ##gno ##se mer ##s - co ##v and blood bank ability to prepare con ##vale ##scent plasma ; and ( 3 ) , research capacity to conduct random ##ized controlled trials . the question ##naire was email ##ed to physicians . results : of 58 ##2 physicians who were invited to the survey , 327 responded ( 56 . 2 % ) . the professional focus of the majority of respondents was critical care ( 106 / 249 ( 43 % ) ) , pediatric ##s ( 59 / 249 , ( 24 % ) ) or internal medicine ( 52 / 249 ( 21 % ) ) but none was blood banking . nearly all respondents ( 251 / 263 ( 95 % ) ) reported to have access to ic ##u facilities within their institutions . most respondents ( 219 / 270 ( 81 % ) ) reported that int ##ens ##ivist ##s were the most physician group responsible for treatment decisions about critically ill sar ##i patients . while 125 / 165 respondents ( 76 % ) reported that they conduct research in ic ##us , and 80 / 161 ( 49 . 7 % ) had been involved in the conduct of rc ##ts , including using a place ##bo comparison ( 60 / 161 ( 37 % ) ) , only 49 / 226 ( 21 % ) of respondents regularly participated in research networks . conclusions : our survey indicated that in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) , ic ##us are the most likely clinical locations for conducting a clinical trial of con ##vale ##scent plasma therapy for mer ##s - co ##v , and that most ic ##us have experience with such research designs . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##12 ##8 ##7 ##1 - 01 ##6 - 01 ##9 ##8 - x ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
on may 20th 2015 , a 68 year old man was the first to be diagnosed with middle east respiratory syndrome - corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in korea . he travelled to bahrain , saudi arabia , and qatar for 16 days . on may 4th 2015 , the patient entered korea , with feb ##ril ##e sense and respiratory symptoms that appeared on may 11th . the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak became worse and several patients had to be admitted throughout various hospitals starting at the beginning of june . this situation led to a nationwide chaos . the rapid response team ( rr ##t ) was organized after the korean government ' s calling for specialists that were composed of 15 infectious disease doctors and 2 infection control professionals on the 8th of june 2015 . the main purpose of the rr ##t were : 1 ) consultation to the government controlling mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . 2 ) visit hospitals that were exposed to mer ##s - co ##v infected patients , and to provide advice regarding infection control strategy for rehab ##ili ##tat ##ing of the exposed hospitals . since june 8th , the rr ##t visited more than 10 hospitals and an effective consultation was carried out . most of the hospitals were recovering from the mer ##s outbreak since early july . cooperation between the government and private sector experts was very effective . the efforts of government and private sector experts overcame the initial chaos situation . it could prevent further deterioration of the mer ##s outbreak .  
a year has passed since the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak in the republic of korea . this 2015 outbreak led to a better understanding of healthcare infection control . the first korean patient infected by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was diagnosed on may 20 , 2015 , after he returned from qatar and bahrain . thereafter , 186 korean people were infected with the mer ##s - co ##v in a short time through human - to - human transmission . all these cases were linked to healthcare settings , and 25 ( 13 . 5 % ) infected patients were healthcare workers . phylogenetic analysis suggested that the mer ##s - co ##v isolate found in the korean patient was closely related to the qatar strain , and did not harbor transmission efficiency - improving mutations . nevertheless , with the same in ##fect ##ing virus strain , korea experienced the largest mer ##s - co ##v outbreak outside the arabian peninsula , primarily due to the different characteristics of population density and the healthcare system . we aimed to review the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological features and existing knowledge on the korean mer ##s outbreak , and suggest methods to prevent future epidemic ##s .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a disease of the lower respiratory tract and is characterized by high mortality . it is caused by a beta corona ##virus ( co ##v ) referred to as mer ##s - co ##v . majority of mer ##s - co ##v cases have been reported from saudi arabia . aim : we investigated the human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) class ii all ##eles in patients with severe mer ##s who were admitted in our intensive care unit . methods : a total of 23 saudi patients with severe mer ##s - co ##v infection were typed for h ##la class ii , results were compared with those of 161 healthy controls . results : two h ##la class ii all ##eles were associated with the disease ; h ##la - dr ##b ##1 * 11 : 01 and dq ##b ##1 * 02 : 02 , but not with the disease outcome . conclusions : our results suggest that the h ##la - dr ##b ##1 * 11 : 01 and dq ##b ##1 * 02 : 02 may be associated with su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to mer ##s .  
risk factors for human - to - human transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are largely unknown . after mer ##s - co ##v infections occurred in an extended family in saudi arabia in 2014 , relatives were tested by using real - time reverse transcription pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) and ser ##olo ##gic methods . among 79 relatives , 19 ( 24 % ) were mer ##s - co ##v positive ; 11 were hospitalized , and 2 died . eleven ( 58 % ) tested positive by rr ##t - pc ##r ; 8 ( 42 % ) tested negative by rr ##t - pc ##r but positive by ser ##ology . compared with mer ##s - co ##v – negative adult relatives , mer ##s - co ##v – positive adult relatives were older and more likely to be male and to have chronic medical conditions . risk factors for household transmission included sleeping in an index patient ’ s room and touching respiratory secret ##ions from an index patient . casual contact and simple proximity were not associated with transmission . ser ##ology was more sensitive than standard rr ##t - pc ##r for identifying infected relatives , highlighting the value of including ser ##ology in future investigations .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) remains a serious international public health threat . with the goal of accelerating the development of counter ##me ##as ##ures against mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , funding agencies , non ##go ##vern ##mental organizations , and researchers across the world assembled in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , on november 14 – 15 , 2015 , to discuss vaccine development challenges . the meeting was spearheaded by the saudi ministry of health and co - organized by the international vaccine institute , south korea . accelerating the development of a prevent ##ive vaccine requires a better understanding of mer ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , transmission , and pathogen ##esis in humans and animals . a combination of rode ##nt and non ##hum ##an primate models should be considered in evaluating and developing prevent ##ive and therapeutic vaccine candidates . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s should be considered for the development of veterinary vaccines . several vaccine technology platforms targeting the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein were discussed . mechanisms to maximize investment , provide robust data , and affect public health are urgently needed .  
rec ##om ##bina ##tion is a process that un ##link ##s neighboring lo ##ci allowing for independent evolutionary tr ##aj ##ect ##ories within genome ##s of many organisms . if not properly accounted for , rec ##om ##bina ##tion can compromise many evolutionary analyses . in addition , when dealing with organisms that are not ob ##liga ##tel ##y sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing , rec ##om ##bina ##tion gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineage ##s come into contact . since june 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused 1 , 106 laboratory - confirmed infections , with 421 mer ##s - co ##v - associated deaths as of 16 april 2015 . although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoo ##not ##ic beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the middle east . in this article , we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that mer ##s - co ##v genome has likely undergone numerous rec ##om ##bina ##tions recently . rec ##om ##bina ##tion in mer ##s - co ##v implies frequent co - infection with distinct lineage ##s of mer ##s - co ##v , probably in camel ##s given the current understanding of mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has repeatedly caused outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula . to date , no approved medical counter ##me ##as ##ures ( mc ##m ) are available to combat mer ##s - co ##v infections . several neutral ##izing human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) , including m3 ##36 , a ge ##rm ##line - like human mab , have been chosen as promising mc ##m for mer ##s - co ##v . however , their clinical development has been hind ##ered by the lack of a robust animal model that rec ##ap ##it ##ulate the mor ##bid ##ity and mortality of human infections . we assessed the prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic efficacy of m3 ##36 by using well - characterized trans ##genic mice shown to be highly sensitive to mer ##s - co ##v infection and disease . we found that mice treated with m3 ##36 prior to or post lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenging were fully protected , compared to control mice which suffer ##ered from profound weight loss and uniform death within days after infection . taken together , these results support further development of m3 ##36 and other human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies as potential therapeutic ##s for mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
we explored the feasibility of collecting con ##vale ##scent plasma for passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection by using elisa to screen serum samples from 44 ##3 potential plasma donors : 196 patients with suspected or laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection , 230 healthcare workers , and 17 household contacts exposed to mer ##s - co ##v . elisa - reactive samples were further tested by indirect fluorescent antibody and micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ays . of the 44 ##3 tested samples , 12 ( 2 . 7 % ) had a reactive elisa result , and 9 of the 12 had reactive indirect fluorescent antibody and micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ay ti ##ters . undertaking clinical trials of con ##vale ##scent plasma for passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py of mer ##s - co ##v infection may be feasible , but such trials would be challenging because of the small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody ti ##ters . alternative strategies to identify con ##vale ##scent plasma donors with adequate antibody ti ##ters should be explored , including the sampling of serum from patients with more severe disease and sampling at earlier points during illness .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first recognized in 2012 and can cause severe disease in infected humans . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the reservoir for the virus , although , other than nasal discharge , these animals do not display any over ##t clinical disease . data from in vitro experiments suggest that other livestock such as sheep , goats , and horses might also contribute to viral transmission , although field data has not identified any ser ##op ##osi ##tive animals . in order to understand if these animals could be infected , we challenged young goats and horses and adult sheep with mer ##s - co ##v by intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation . minimal or no virus shed ##ding was detected in all of the animals . during the four weeks following in ##oc ##ulation , neutral ##izing antibodies were detected in the young goats , but not in sheep or horses .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was exported to korea in 2015 , resulting in a threat to neighboring nations . we evaluated the possibility of using a digital surveillance system based on web searches and social media data to monitor this mer ##s outbreak . we collected the number of daily laboratory - confirmed mer ##s cases and qu ##aran ##tine ##d cases from may 11 , 2015 to june 26 , 2015 using the korean government mer ##s portal . the daily trends observed via google search and twitter during the same time period were also as ##cer ##tained using google trends and tops ##y . correlation ##s among the data were then examined using spear ##man correlation analysis . we found high correlation ##s ( > 0 . 7 ) between google search and twitter results and the number of confirmed mer ##s cases for the previous three days using only four simple key ##words : “ mer ##s ” , “ [ image : see text ] ” ( “ mer ##s ( in korean ) ” ) , “ [ image : see text ] ” ( “ mer ##s symptoms ( in korean ) ” ) , and “ [ image : see text ] ” ( “ mer ##s hospital ( in korean ) ” ) . additionally , we found high correlation ##s between the google search and twitter results and the number of qu ##aran ##tine ##d cases using the above key ##words . this study demonstrates the possibility of using a digital surveillance system to monitor the outbreak of mer ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) he ##lica ##se is a superfamily 1 he ##lica ##se containing seven conserved motifs . we have clone ##d , expressed , and pu ##rified a st ##re ##p - fused rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 13 ( m - ns ##p ##13 ) he ##lica ##se . characterization of its bio ##chemical properties showed that it un ##wo ##und dna and rna similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ns ##p ##13 ( s - ns ##p ##13 ) he ##lica ##se . we showed that m - ns ##p ##13 un ##wo ##und in a 5 ′ - to - 3 ′ direction and efficiently un ##wo ##und the partially du ##plex rna substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the rna substrates with a short or no loading strand . moreover , the k ( m ) of atp for m - ns ##p ##13 is inverse ##ly proportional to the length of the 5 ′ loading strand of the partially du ##plex rna substrates . finally , we also showed that the rate of un ##wind ##ing ( ku ) of m - ns ##p ##13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5 ′ loading strand of the partially du ##plex rna substrate . these results provide insights that enhance our understanding of the bio ##chemical properties of m - ns ##p ##13 . importance corona ##virus ##es are known to cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans in the middle east , europe , north africa , and the united states of america . he ##lica ##ses are motor proteins that cat ##aly ##ze the process ##ive separation of double - stranded nuclei ##c acids into two single - stranded nuclei ##c acids by utilizing the energy derived from atp hydro ##lysis . mer ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se is one of the most important viral replication enzymes of this corona ##virus . here ##in , we report the first bacterial expression , enzyme purification , and bio ##chemical characterization of mer ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se . the knowledge obtained from this study might be used to identify an inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v replication , and the he ##lica ##se might be used as a therapeutic target .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging pathogen , first recognized in 2012 , with a high case fatal ##ity risk , no vaccine , and no treatment beyond supportive care . we estimated the relative risks of death and severe disease among mer ##s - co ##v patients in the middle east between 2012 and 2015 for several risk factors , using po ##isson regression with robust variance and a boots ##tra ##p - based expectation maxim ##ization algorithm to handle extensive missing data . increased age and underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ty were risk factors for both death and severe disease , while cases arising in saudi arabia were more likely to be severe . cases occurring later in the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v and among health - care workers were less serious . this study represents an attempt to estimate risk factors for an emerging infectious disease using open data and to address some of the uncertainty surrounding mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology .  
to determine if a hyper ##sen ##sit ##ive - type lung pathology might occur when mice were given an inactivated mer ##s - co ##v vaccine and challenged with infectious virus as was seen with sar ##s - co ##v vaccines , we prepared and va ##cci ##nated mice with an inactivated mer ##s - co ##v vaccine . neutral ##izing antibody was induced by vaccine with and without ad ##ju ##vant and lung virus was reduced in va ##cci ##nated mice after challenge . lung mono ##nu ##cle ##ar infiltrate ##s occurred in all groups after virus challenge but with increased infiltrate ##s that contained e ##osi ##no ##phi ##ls and increases in the e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l promoting il - 5 and il - 13 cy ##tok ##ines only in the vaccine groups . inactivated mer ##s - co ##v vaccine appears to carry a hyper ##sen ##sit ##ive - type lung pathology risk from mer ##s - co ##v infection that is similar to that found with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccines from sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : the complex inter ##play between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood . while many viruses are known to employ anti - immune strategies to facilitate their replication , highly pathogen ##ic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that ex ##ace ##rba ##tes , rather than reduces pathogen ##ici ##ty . to investigate this di ##cho ##tom ##y in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , we developed a transcription ##al network model of sar ##s - co ##v infection in mice and used the model to prior ##iti ##ze candidate regulatory targets for further investigation . results : we valid ##ated our predictions in 18 different knockout ( ko ) mouse strains , showing that network topology provides significant predict ##ive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection . we identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection , ke ##pi , an inhibitor ##y subunit of the protein ph ##os ##pha ##tase 1 ( pp ##1 ) complex , which protects against sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis . we also found that receptors for the pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ine tumor nec ##rosis factor alpha ( tn ##f ##α ) promote pathogen ##esis , presumably through excessive inflammation . conclusions : the current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogen ##esis , and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease . the results presented here suggest the role of ke ##pi in the host response to sar ##s - co ##v , as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogen ##esis through tn ##f ##α signaling in sar ##s - co ##v infections . though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously , this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict ph ##eno ##type ##s in mice with experimental validation . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##12 ##9 ##18 - 01 ##6 - 03 ##36 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
nearly 4 years after the first report of the emergence of middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and nearly 1800 human cases later , the ecology of mer ##s - co ##v , its ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , and more than risk factors of mer ##s - co ##v transmission between camel ##s are poorly understood . knowledge about the pathways and mechanisms of transmission from animals to humans is limited ; as of yet , transmission risks have not been quan ##ti ##fied . moreover the diver ##gent sanitary situations and exposure ##s to animals among populations in the arabian peninsula , where human primary cases appear to dominate , vs . other regions in the middle east and africa , with no reported human clinical cases and where the virus has been detected only in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , represents huge scientific and health challenges . here , we have used expert - opinion eli ##cit ##ation in order to obtain ideas on relative importance of mer ##s - co ##v risk factors and estimates of transmission risks from various types of contact between humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . fourteen experts with diverse and extensive experience in mer ##s - co ##v relevant fields were enrolled and completed an online question ##naire that examined pathways based on several scenarios , e . g . , camel ##s – camel ##s , camel ##s – human , bats / other species to camel ##s / humans , and the role of diverse biological substances ( milk , urine , etc . ) and potential f ##omi ##tes . experts believed that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s play the largest role in mer ##s - co ##v infection of other dr ##ome ##dar ##ies ; however , they also indicated a significant influence of the season ( i . e . calvin ##g or we ##ani ##ng periods ) on transmission risk . all experts thought that mer ##s - co ##v - infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic humans play the most important role in infection of humans , with bats and other species presenting a possible , but yet und ##efined , risk . direct and indirect contact of humans with dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s were identified as the most risky types of contact , when compared to consumption of various camel products , with estimated “ most likely ” incidence risks of at least 22 and 13 % for direct and indirect contact , respectively . the results of our study are consistent with available , yet very limited , published data regarding the potential pathways of transmission of mer ##s - co ##v at the animal – human interface . these results identify key knowledge gaps and highlight the need for more comprehensive , yet focused research to be conducted to better understand transmission between dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and humans .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory infections that can be life - threatening . to establish an infection and spread , mer ##s - co ##v , like most other viruses , must navigate through an intricate network of anti ##vira ##l host responses . besides the well - known type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - α / β ) response , the protein kinase r ( p ##kr ) - mediated stress response is being recognized as an important innate response pathway . upon detecting viral ds ##rna , p ##kr ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lates e ##if ##2 ##α , leading to the inhibition of cellular and viral translation and the formation of stress gran ##ules ( sg ##s ) , which are increasingly recognized as platforms for anti ##vira ##l signaling pathways . it is unknown whether cellular infection by mer ##s - co ##v activate ##s the stress response pathway or whether the virus has evolved strategies to suppress this infection - limiting pathway . here , we show that cellular infection with mer ##s - co ##v does not lead to the formation of sg ##s . by transient ##ly expressing the mer ##s - co ##v accessory proteins individually , we identified a role of protein 4a ( p ##4 ##a ) in preventing activation of the stress response pathway . expression of mer ##s - co ##v p ##4 ##a imp ##eded ds ##rna - mediated p ##kr activation , thereby rescuing translation inhibition and preventing sg formation . in contrast , p ##4 ##a failed to suppress stress response pathway activation that is independent of p ##kr and ds ##rna . mer ##s - co ##v p ##4 ##a is a ds ##rna binding protein . mutation of the ds ##rna binding motif in p ##4 ##a disrupted its p ##kr antagonist ##ic activity . by insert ##ing p ##4 ##a in a pic ##orn ##avi ##rus lacking its natural p ##kr antagonist , we showed that p ##4 ##a ex ##ert ##s p ##kr antagonist ##ic activity also under infection conditions . however , a rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v def ##icient in p ##4 ##a expression still suppressed sg formation , indicating the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist . this virus also suppressed the ds ##rna - independent stress response pathway . thus , mer ##s - co ##v interfere ##s with anti ##vira ##l stress responses using at least two different mechanisms , with p ##4 ##a suppress ##ing the p ##kr - dependent stress response pathway , probably by se ##quest ##ering ds ##rna . mer ##s - co ##v p ##4 ##a represents the first corona ##virus stress response antagonist described .  
healthcare settings can amp ##li ##fy transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , but knowledge gaps about the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of transmission remain . we conducted a retrospective co ##hort study among healthcare personnel in hospital units that treated mer ##s - co ##v patients . participants were interviewed about exposure ##s to mer ##s - co ##v patients , use of personal protective equipment , and signs and symptoms of illness after exposure . infection status was determined by the presence of antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v . to assess risk factors , we compared infected and un ##in ##fect ##ed participants . healthcare personnel caring for mer ##s - co ##v patients were at high risk for infection , but infection most often resulted in a relatively mild illness that might be un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed . in the healthcare personnel co ##hort reported here , infections occurred exclusively among those who had close contact with mer ##s - co ##v patients .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) first emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 and remains a global health concern . the objective of this study was to compare the clinical features and risk factors for adverse outcome in patients with rt - pc ##r confirmed mer ##s and in those with acute respiratory disease who were mer ##s - co ##v negative , presenting to the king fa ##had medical city ( k ##fm ##c ) in ri ##yad ##h between october 2012 and may 2014 . the demographics , clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with rt - pc ##r confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection was compared with those testing negative mer ##s - co ##v pc ##r . health care workers ( hc ##w ) with mer ##s were compared with mer ##s patients who were not health care workers . one hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion . forty eight tested positive for mer ##s co ##v , 44 ( 92 % ) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were hc ##w . there were 111 mer ##s - co ##v negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as “ negative controls ” . patient with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection were not clinical ##ly distinguish ##able from those with negative mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r results although dia ##rr ##hoe ##a was common ##er in mer ##s patients . a high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for mer ##s - co ##v is therefore indicated . variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co - mor ##bid illness . interesting ##ly , co - mor ##bid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome . health care workers with mer ##s had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non hc ##w mer ##s patients .  
first identified in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is listed as a new category c priority pathogen . while the high mortality of mer ##s - co ##v infection is further intensified by potential human - to - human trans ##mis ##sibility , no mer ##s vaccines are available for human use . this review explains immune responses resulting from mer ##s - co ##v infection , describes mer ##s vaccine criteria , and presents available small animal models to evaluate the efficacy of mer ##s vaccines . current advances in vaccine development are summarized , focusing on specific applications and limitations of each vaccine category . taken together , this review provides valuable guidelines toward the development of an effective and safe mer ##s vaccine . this article is written for a special focus issue of expert review of vaccines on “ vaccines for bio ##de ##fen ##ce ” .  
aim : to sum ##mar ##ize the reported middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cases , the associated clinical presentations and the outcomes . methods : we searched the saudi ministry of health website , the world health organization website , and the flu ##tra ##cker website . we also searched med ##line and pub ##med for the key ##words : middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v in combination with pediatric , children , childhood , infancy and pregnancy from the initial discovery of the virus in 2012 to 2016 . the retrieved articles were also read to further find other articles . relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly . descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary . results : from june 2012 to april 19 , 2016 , there were a total of 31 pediatric mer ##s - co ##v cases . of these cases 13 ( 42 % ) were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and the male to female ratio was 1 . 7 : 1 . the mean age of patients was 9 . 8 ± 5 . 4 years . twenty - five ( 80 . 6 % ) of the cases were reported from the kingdom of saudi arabia . the most common source of infection was household contact ( 10 of 15 with reported source ) and 5 patients acquired infection within a health care facility . using real time reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction of pediatric patients revealed that 9 out of 55 ##2 ( 1 . 6 % ) was positive in the kingdom of saudi arabia . conclusion : utilizing ser ##ology for mer ##s - co ##v infection in jordan and saudi arabia did not reveal any positive patients . thus , the number of the pediatric mer ##s - co ##v is low ; the exact reason for the low prevalence of the disease in children is not known .  
genome sequence analysis of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogen ##esis of the virus . however , most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of mer ##s - co ##vs , pre ##cl ##uding an investigation of intra ##patient het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y . here , we analyzed non – consensus sequences to character ##ize intra ##patient het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of mer ##s in south korea . deep - sequencing analysis of mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intra ##patient variation ; therefore , sequence het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing . a total of 35 specimens from 24 patients ( including a super - spread ##er ) were sequence ##d to detect and analyze variants displaying intra ##patient het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y . based on the analysis of non – consensus sequences , we demonstrated the intra ##patient het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y of mer ##s - co ##vs , with the highest level in the super - spread ##er specimen . the het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences , suggesting the occurrence of multiple mer ##s - co ##v infections . analysis of intra ##patient het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y revealed a relationship between d ##51 ##0 ##g and i ##52 ##9 ##t mutations in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . these two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the rb ##d for human cd ##26 . notably , although the frequency of both d ##51 ##0 ##g and i ##52 ##9 ##t varied greatly among specimens , the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high ( 87 . 7 % ± 1 . 9 % on average ) . concurrently , the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6 . 5 % ± 1 . 7 % on average , supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure ex ##erted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human mer ##s - co ##vs during the outbreak .  
viral subunit vaccines often contain im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant non - neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes that divert host immune responses . these ep ##ito ##pes should be eliminated in vaccine design , but there is no reliable method for evaluating an ep ##ito ##pe ' s capacity to eli ##cit neutral ##izing immune responses . here we introduce a new concept ‘ neutral ##izing im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity index ' ( ni ##i ) to evaluate an ep ##ito ##pe ' s neutral ##izing im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . to determine the ni ##i , we mask the ep ##ito ##pe with a g ##ly ##can probe and then assess the ep ##ito ##pe ' s contribution to the vaccine ' s overall neutral ##izing im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . as proof - of - concept , we measure the ni ##i for different ep ##ito ##pes on an im ##mun ##ogen comprised of the receptor - binding domain from mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . further , we design a variant form of this vaccine by mask ##ing an ep ##ito ##pe that has a negative ni ##i score . this engineered vaccine demonstrates significantly enhanced efficacy in protecting trans ##genic mice from lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge . our study may guide the rational design of highly effective subunit vaccines to combat mer ##s - co ##v and other life - threatening viruses .  
a case - control study was performed to identify clinical predict ##ors for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection among patients with acute feb ##ril ##e illness during the nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak . patients with mer ##s - co ##v were more likely to have mono ##cy ##tosis with normal white blood cell ( wb ##c ) count and lower c - reactive protein ( cr ##p ) level . simple laboratory data such as complete blood counts ( cbc ) with differential count could be a useful marker for the prediction of mer ##s and tri ##age at the initial presentation of acute feb ##ril ##e patients in outbreak setting .  
two novel corona ##virus ##es have emerged in humans in the 21 ( st ) century , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome human corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , both of which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and have high mortality rates . there are no clinical ##ly approved vaccines or anti ##vira ##l drugs available for either of these infections ; thus , a priority in the field is the development of effective therapeutic and prevent ##ive strategies that can be readily applied to new emerge ##nt strains . this review will : describe the emergence and identification of novel human corona ##virus ##es over the last 10 years ; review their key biological features , including tr ##op ##ism and receptor use ; and sum ##mar ##ize approaches to develop broadly effective vaccines .  
the first imported case of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in china recently occurred , allowing for the characterization of antibody ti ##ters in a series of the patient ' s sera using the following methods based on rec ##om ##bina ##nt viral structural antigen ##s : inactivated mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s , or fragments of s ) elisa , nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ( np ) elisa and mer ##s s pseudo ##virus particle - based neutral ##ization test ( pp ##nt ) . a longitudinal profile of the infection showed that ser ##oco ##n ##version detected by elisa ##s based on the rec ##om ##bina ##nt extra ##cellular domain , s , s ##1 and receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) antigen ##s occurred as early as neutral ##izing antibodies were detected by the pp ##nt and earlier than antibodies were detected by the inactivated mer ##s - co ##v and n - terminal domain ( nt ##d ) elisa ##s . antibodies detected by the np elisa occurred last . strong correlation ##s were found between the s ##1 , rb ##d and np elisa ##s and the inactivated mer ##s - co ##v elisa . the s and rb ##d elisa ##s were highly correlated with the commercial s ##1 elisa . the s elisa strongly correlated with the pp ##nt , although the mer ##s - co ##v , s ##1 , nt ##d and rb ##d elisa ##s were also significantly correlated with the pp ##nt ( p < 0 . 001 ) .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to ci ##rc ##ulate in both humans and camel ##s , and the origin and evolution of the virus remain unclear . here we character ##ize the spike protein of a camel - derived mer ##s - co ##v ( nr ##ce - hk ##u ##20 ##5 ) identified in 2013 , early in the mer ##s outbreak . nr ##ce - hk ##u ##20 ##5 spike protein has a variant cleavage motif with regard to the s ##2 ′ fusion activation site — notably , a novel substitution of iso ##le ##uc ##ine for the otherwise invariant ser ##ine at the critical p ##1 ′ cleavage site position . the substitution ##s resulted in a loss of fur ##in - mediated cleavage , as shown by flu ##oro ##genic peptide cleavage and western b ##lot ass ##ays . cell – cell fusion and pseudo ##type ##d virus in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ays demonstrated that the s ##2 ′ substitution ##s decreased spike - mediated fusion and viral entry . however , cat ##he ##ps ##in and try ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se activation were retained , albeit with much reduced efficiency compared with the proto ##typical em ##c / 2012 human strain . we show that nr ##ce - hk ##u ##20 ##5 has more limited fusion activation properties possibly resulting in more restricted viral tr ##op ##ism and may represent an intermediate in the complex pattern of mer ##s - co ##v ecology and evolution .  
knowledge about immunity to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s is essential for infection control and va ##cci ##nation . a longitudinal study of 11 dam – calf pairs showed that calves lose maternal mer ##s - co ##v antibodies 5 – 6 months post ##par ##tur ##ition and are left susceptible to infection , indicating a short window of opportunity for va ##cci ##nation .  
background : the kingdom of saudi arabia has experienced a prolonged outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus since 2012 . healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) form a significant risk group for infection . objectives : the aim of this survey was to assess the knowledge , attitudes , infection control practices and educational needs of hc ##ws in the kingdom of saudi arabia to mer ##s corona ##virus and other emerging infectious diseases . methods : 1500 of hc ##ws from saudi ministry of health were invited to fill a question ##naire developed to cover the survey objectives from 9 september 2015 to 8 november 2015 . the response rate was about 81 % . descriptive statistics was used to sum ##mar ##ise the responses . results : 121 ##6 hc ##ws were included in this survey . a total of 56 . 5 % were nurses and 22 % were physicians . the most common sources of mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) information were the ministry of health ( mo ##h ) memo ( 74 . 3 % ) . only ( 47 . 6 % ) of the physicians , ( 30 . 4 % ) of the nurses and ( 29 . 9 % ) of the other hc ##ws were aware that as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s - co ##v was described . around half of respondents who having been investigated for mer ##s - co ##v reported that their work performance decreased while they have suspicion of having mer ##s - co ##v and almost two thirds reported having psychological problems during this period . almost two thirds of the hc ##ws ( 61 . 2 % ) reported anxiety about contracting mer ##s - co ##v from patients . conclusions : the knowledge about emerging infectious diseases was poor and there is need for further education and training programs particularly in the use of personal protective equipment , isolation and infection control measures . the self - reported infection control practices were sub - optimal and seem to be over ##est ##imated .  
over the past two decades a number of severe acute respiratory infection outbreak ##s such as the 2009 influenza a ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have emerged and presented a considerable global public health threat . ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic evidence suggests that dia ##bet ##ic subjects are more susceptible to these conditions . however , the prevalence of diabetes in h ##1 ##n ##1 and mer ##s - co ##v has not been systematically described . the aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta - analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of diabetes in h ##1 ##n ##1 and mer ##s - co ##v and compare its frequency in the two viral conditions . meta - analysis for the proportions of subjects with diabetes was carried out in 29 studies for h ##1 ##n ##1 ( n = 92 , 94 ##8 ) and 9 for mer ##s - co ##v ( n = 308 ) . average age of h ##1 ##n ##1 patients ( 36 . 2 ##± ##6 . 0 years ) was significantly younger than that of subjects with mer ##s - co ##v ( 54 . 3 ##± ##7 . 4 years , p < 0 . 05 ) . compared to mer ##s - co ##v patients , subjects with h ##1 ##n ##1 exhibited 3 - fold lower frequency of cardiovascular diseases and 2 - and 4 - fold higher prevalence of obesity and im ##mun ##os ##up ##press ##ion , respectively . the overall prevalence of diabetes in h ##1 ##n ##1 was 14 . 6 % ( 95 % ci : 12 . 3 - 17 . 0 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) , a 3 . 6 - fold lower than in mer ##s - co ##v ( 54 . 4 % ; 95 % ci : 29 . 4 - 79 . 5 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . the prevalence of diabetes among h ##1 ##n ##1 cases from asia and north america was ~ two - fold higher than those from south america and europe . the prevalence of diabetes in mer ##s - co ##v cases is higher than in h ##1 ##n ##1 . regional comparisons suggest that an et ##iol ##og ##ic role of diabetes in mer ##s - co ##v may exist distinctive from that in h ##1 ##n ##1 .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . more than 80 % of reported cases have occurred in saudi arabia , with a mortality exceeding 50 % . health - care workers ( hc ##ws ) are at risk of acquiring and transmitting this virus , so the concerns of hc ##ws in saudi arabia regarding mer ##s were evaluated . methods : an anonymous , self - administered , previously valid ##ated question ##naire was given to 103 ##1 hc ##ws at three tertiary hospitals in saudi arabia from october to december , 2014 . concerns regarding the disease , its severity and governmental efforts to contain it , as well as disease outcomes were assessed using 31 concern statements in five distinct domains . a total concern score was calculated for each hc ##w . multiple regression analyses were used to identify predict ##ors of high concern scores . results : the average age of participants was 37 . 1 ± 9 . 0 years , 65 . 8 % were married and 59 . 1 % were nurses . the majority of respondents ( 70 . 4 % ) felt at risk of contracting a mer ##s - co ##v infection at work , 69 . 1 % felt threatened if a colleague contracted mer ##s - co ##v , 60 . 9 % felt obliged to care for patients infected with mer ##s - co ##v and 87 . 8 % did not feel safe at work using standard precautions . in addition , 87 . 7 % believed that the government should isolate patients with mer ##s in specialized hospitals , 73 . 7 % agreed with travel restriction to and from areas affected by mer ##s and 65 . 3 % agreed with avoiding inviting ex ##pa ##tri ##ates from such areas . after adjustment for co ##var ##iate ##s , high concern scores were significantly associated with being a saudi national ( p < 0 . 001 ) , a non - physician ( p < 0 . 001 ) and working in the central region ( p < 0 . 001 ) . conclusions : the majority of respondents reported concern regarding mer ##s - co ##v infection from exposure at work . the overall level of concern may be influenced by previous experience of mer ##s outbreak ##s and related cultural issues . the concerns of hc ##ws may affect their overall effectiveness in an outbreak and should be addressed by incorporating management strategies in outbreak planning .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is proposed to be a zoo ##not ##ic disease . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been implicated due to reports that some confirmed cases were exposed to camel ##s . risk factors for mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections in humans are incomplete ##ly understood . this study aimed to describe the demographic characteristics , mortality rate , clinical manifestation ##s and como ##rb ##idi ##ties with confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v . methods : retrospective chart review were performed to identify all laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v in saudi arabia who reported to the ministry of health ( mo ##h ) of saudi arabia and who between april 23 , 2014 and august 31 , 2015 . patients ’ charts were also reviewed for demographic information , mortality , como ##rb ##idi ##ties , clinical presentations , health care facility and presented with descriptive and comparative statistics using non para ##metric bin ##omi ##al test and chi - square test . results : confirmed cases of male patients ( 61 . 1 % ) exceeded those of female patients ( 38 . 9 % ) . infections among saudi patients ( 62 . 6 % ) exceeded those among non - saudi patients ( 37 . 4 % ; p = 0 . 001 ) . the majority of the patients were aged 21 – 40 years ( 37 . 4 % ) or 41 – 60 years ( 35 . 8 % ) ; 43 ( 22 . 6 % ) were aged > 61 years , and ( 8 ) 4 . 2 % were aged 0 – 20 years . there was a difference in mortality between confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases ( 63 . 7 % alive versus 36 . 3 % dead cases , respectively ) . furthermore , fever with cough and short ##ness of breath ( sob ) ( n = 39 ; 20 . 5 % ) , fever with cough ( n = 29 ; 15 . 3 % ) , fever ( n = 18 ; 9 . 5 % ) , and fever with sob ( n = 13 ; 6 . 8 % ) , were the most common clinical manifestation ##s associated with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v is considered an epidemic in saudi arabia . the results of the present study showed that the frequency of cases is higher among men than women , in saudi patients than non - saudi , and those between 21 to 60 years are most affected . further studies are required to improve the surveillance associated with mer ##s - co ##v to get definite and clear answers and better understanding of the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak as well the source , and route of infection transmission in saudi
the global outbreak of sar ##s in 2002 - 2003 was caused by the infection of a new human corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v . the infection of sar ##s - co ##v is mediated mainly through the viral surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , which consist of s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s and form trim ##er spikes on the envelope of the vi ##rion ##s . here we report the ec ##to ##dom ##ain structures of the sar ##s - co ##v surface spike trim ##er in different conform ##ation ##al states determined by single - particle cry ##o - electron microscopy . the conform ##ation 1 determined at 4 . 3 a resolution is three - fold symmetric and has all the three receptor - binding c - terminal domain 1 ( ct ##d ##1 ##s ) of the s ##1 subunit ##s in “ down ” positions . the binding of the “ down ” ct ##d ##1 ##s to the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ace ##2 is not possible due to ste ##ric clashes , suggesting that the conform ##ation 1 represents a receptor - binding inactive state . conform ##ations 2 - 4 determined at 7 . 3 , 5 . 7 and 6 . 8 a resolutions are all as ##ym ##metric , in which one rb ##d rotate ##s away from the “ down ” position by different angles to an “ up ” position . the “ up ” ct ##d ##1 expose ##s the receptor - binding site for ace ##2 engagement , suggesting that the conform ##ations 2 - 4 represent a receptor - binding active state . this conform ##ation ##al change is also required for the binding of sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies targeting the ct ##d ##1 . this phenomenon could be extended to other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es utilizing ct ##d ##1 of the s ##1 subunit for receptor binding , which provides new insights into the intermediate states of corona ##virus pre - fusion spike trim ##er during infection .  
objectives : as of 1 november 2015 , the saudi ministry of health had reported 127 ##3 cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) ; among these cases , which included 9 outbreak ##s at several hospitals , 71 ##7 ( 56 % ) patients recovered , 14 ( 1 % ) remain hospital ##ised and 54 ##3 ( 43 % ) died . this study aimed to determine the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , demographic and clinical characteristics that distinguished cases of mer ##s contracted during outbreak ##s from those contracted sporadic ##ally ( ie , non - outbreak ) between 2012 and 2015 in saudi arabia . design : data from the saudi ministry of health of confirmed outbreak and non - outbreak cases of mer ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections from september 2012 through october 2015 were abstract ##ed and anal ##yse ##d . un ##ivar ##iate and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted , and the time between disease onset and confirmation , onset and notification and onset and death were examined . results : a total of 125 ##0 patients ( aged 0 – 109 years ; mean , 50 . 82 ##5 years ) were reported infected with mer ##s - co ##v . approximately two - thirds of all mer ##s cases were diagnosed in men for outbreak and non - outbreak cases . healthcare workers comprised 22 % of all mer ##s cases for outbreak and non - outbreak cases . nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections comprised one - third of all saudi mer ##s cases ; however , nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections occurred more frequently in outbreak than non - outbreak cases ( p < 0 . 001 ) . patients contracting mer ##s during an outbreak were significantly more likely to die of mer ##s ( p < 0 . 001 ) . conclusions : to date , nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections have fuel ##led mer ##s outbreak ##s . given that the kingdom of saudi arabia is a worldwide religious travel destination , local ##ised outbreak ##s may have massive global implications and effective outbreak prevent ##ive measures are needed .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) first emerged in 2003 , causing the sar ##s epidemic which resulted in a 10 % fatal ##ity rate . the advancement ##s in meta ##gen ##omic techniques have allowed the identification of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##vs ) sequences that share high homo ##logy to the human sar ##s - co ##v epidemic strains from wildlife bats , presenting concrete evidence that bats are the origin and natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v . the application of reverse genetics further enabled that characterization of these bat co ##vs and the prediction of their potential to cause disease in humans . the knowledge gained from such studies is valuable in the surveillance and preparation of a possible future outbreak caused by a spill - over of these bat sl - co ##vs .  
background : corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are large rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( rna ) viruses causing primarily respiratory disease in humans . a novel human corona ##virus , subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , was first reported in saudi arabia in september of 2012 . with increasing numbers of infections and deaths from mer ##s - co ##v , development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of mer ##s - co ##v . objectives : in this study , we present two real - time reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) ass ##ays for in - house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of mer ##s - co ##v , detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene ( up ##e ) and open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1b , respectively , for initial screening and final confirmation of mer ##s - co ##v infection , as recommended by the world health organization ( who ) . materials and methods : in this experimental study , acquiring patient samples was difficult ; thus , according to who recommendations and standard protocols , we synthesized rna sequences of up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##b genes as the template signatures and ta ##q ##man based - diagnostic rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of mer ##s - co ##v . in this research , we also inaugurated a cell - free system to trans ##cr ##ibe these rna sequences using the dna template ##s synthesized . results : the up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##b based one - step rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ays were opt ##imi ##zed by testing several times via different synthetic rna ##s , and validation results were highly successful . the sensitivity obtained for up ##e was fewer than ten copies of rna template per reaction and for or ##f ##1 ##b was 50 or fewer copies per reaction . conclusions : this study showed that the developed rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ays are rapid , reliable , rep ##rod ##ucible , specific , sensitive , and simple tools for detection of mer ##s - co ##v . finally , a kit consisting of two ass ##ay signatures and controls was assembled , which can be distributed to public health laboratories in iran to support international mer ##s - co ##v surveillance and public health response .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging viral pathogen that causes severe mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . up to date , there is no approved or licensed vaccine or anti ##vira ##l medicines can be used to treat mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients . here , we analyzed the anti ##vira ##l activities of res ##vera ##tro ##l , a natural compound found in grape seeds and skin and in red wine , against mer ##s - co ##v infection . methods : we performed mt ##t and neutral red up ##take ass ##ays to assess the survival rates of mer ##s - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . in addition , quantitative pc ##r , western b ##lot ##ting , and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent ass ##ays determined the intra ##cellular viral rna and protein expression . for viral productivity , we utilized plaque ass ##ays to confirm the anti ##vira ##l properties of res ##vera ##tro ##l against mer ##s - co ##v . results : res ##vera ##tro ##l significantly inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v infection and prolonged cellular survival after virus infection . we also found that the expression of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein essential for mer ##s - co ##v replication was decreased after res ##vera ##tro ##l treatment . furthermore , res ##vera ##tro ##l down - regulated the ap ##op ##tosis induced by mer ##s - co ##v in vitro . by consecutive administration of res ##vera ##tro ##l , we were able to reduce the concentration of res ##vera ##tro ##l while achieving inhibitor ##y effectiveness against mer ##s - co ##v . conclusion : in this study , we first demonstrated that res ##vera ##tro ##l is a potent anti - mer ##s agent in vitro . we perceive that res ##vera ##tro ##l can be a potential anti ##vira ##l agent against mer ##s - co ##v infection in the near future .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) cases continue to be reported , predominantly in saudi arabia and occasionally other countries . although dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are the main reservoir , other animal species might be susceptible to mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection and potentially serve as reservoirs . to determine whether other animals are potential reservoirs , we in ##oc ##ulated mer ##s - co ##v into ll ##ama ##s , pigs , sheep , and horses and collected nasal and rec ##tal sw ##ab samples at various times . the presence of mer ##s - co ##v in the nose of pigs and ll ##ama ##s was confirmed by pc ##r , ti ##tra ##tion of infectious virus , im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry , and in situ hybrid ##ization ; ser ##oco ##n ##version was detected in animals of both species . conversely , in sheep and horses , virus - specific antibodies did not develop and no evidence of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was found . these results prove the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of ll ##ama ##s and pigs to mer ##s - co ##v infection . thus , the possibility of mer ##s - co ##v circulation in animals other than dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , such as ll ##ama ##s and pigs , is not ne ##gli ##gible .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , which is caused by a newly discovered corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , has recently emerged . it causes severe viral pneumonia and is associated with a high fatal ##ity rate . however , the pathogen ##esis , comparative pathology and inflammatory cell response of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues and common mar ##mos ##ets experimental ##ly infected with mer ##s - co ##v are unknown . we describe the his ##top ##ath ##ological , im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical , and ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural findings from r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue and common mar ##mos ##et animal models of mer ##s - co ##v infection . the main his ##top ##ath ##ological findings in the lungs of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues and common mar ##mos ##ets were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions , including pneumonia , pulmonary o ##ede ##ma , ha ##em ##or ##rh ##age , de ##gen ##eration and nec ##rosis of the p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells , and inflammatory cell in ##filtration . the characteristic inflammatory cells in the lungs of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues and common mar ##mos ##ets were e ##osi ##no ##phi ##ls and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s , respectively . based on these observations , the lungs of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues and common mar ##mos ##ets appeared to develop chronic and acute pneumonia , respectively . mer ##s - co ##v antigen ##s and viral rna were identified in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges and bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells , and ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural observations showed that viral protein was found in type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and inflammatory cells in both species . corresponding ##ly , the entry receptor dd ##p ##4 was found in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells , and al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges . the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue and common mar ##mos ##et animal models of mer ##s - co ##v can be used as a tool to mimic the on ##com ##e of mer ##s - co ##v infections in humans . these models can help to provide a better understanding of the pathogen ##ic process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prop ##hyl ##actic treatments .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel positive sense singles ##tra ##nded rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid virus of the genus beta corona virus . this virus was first isolated from a patient who died from severe respiratory illness in june 2012 in jed ##dah , kingdom of saudi arabia . we describe an unusual case of a 42 year old healthcare worker who was admitted to our intensive care unit ( ic ##u ) king abdul - aziz medical city , with mer ##s - co ##v and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and developed a sudden - onset diabetes ins ##ip ##id ##us and spontaneous massive intra ##cr ##anial hem ##or ##rh ##age with intra - vent ##ric ##ular extension and tons ##illa ##r her ##nia ##tion . computed ang ##io ##gram of the brain did not reveal any an ##eur ##ys ##m or structural defects . she never had un ##con ##tro ##lled hyper ##tension , or coa ##gul ##opa ##thy , nor she received anti ##plate ##lets . we are reporting a rare case of structural neurological damage associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
this article reviews the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical presentation of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection and describes the prepared ##ness plan of several countries . the mer ##s - co ##v was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries , mostly in saudi arabia and the middle east . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir , probably dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . the clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis and respiratory failure . most confirmed cases so far were part of mer ##s - co ##v clusters in hospital settings , affecting mainly middle - aged men and patients with a chronic disease or im ##mun ##o - suppressed status . there is no vaccine or anti - viral medication available . viral epidemic ##s can occur anywhere in today ’ s “ global village ” . mer ##s - co ##v is a relatively new virus , and this work is intended to add to the still - sparse data on its ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , modes of transmission , natural history , and clinical features as well as to describe the prepared ##ness plan for mer ##s - co ##v infection in several countries . effective national and international prepared ##ness plans are essential to predict and control outbreak ##s , improve patient management , and ensure global health security .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is transmitted via the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome by in ##fect ##ing lung ep ##ith ##elial cells and macro ##pha ##ges . macro ##pha ##ges can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it . mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##s cells via its spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that binds on dip ##ept ##id ##yl - pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) receptor present on macro ##pha ##ges . whether this spike / d ##pp ##4 association affects macro ##pha ##ge responses remains unknown . here ##in we demonstrated that infection of macro ##pha ##ges with lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles pseudo ##type ##d with mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein results in suppression of macro ##pha ##ge responses since it reduced the capacity of macro ##pha ##ges to produce tn ##fa and il - 6 in naive and lp ##s - activated th ##p - 1 macro ##pha ##ges and augmented lp ##s - induced production of the im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive cy ##tok ##ine il - 10 . mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein induced the expression of the negative regulator of t ##lr signaling ira ##k - m as well as of the transcription ##al rep ##ress ##or pp ##ar ##γ . inhibition of d ##pp ##4 by its inhibitor sit ##ag ##lip ##tin or sir ##na ab ##rogated the effects of mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein on ira ##k - m , pp ##ar ##γ and il - 10 , confirming that its im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive effects were mediated by d ##pp ##4 receptor . the effect was observed both in th ##p - 1 macro ##pha ##ges and human primary peripheral blood mono ##cytes . these findings support a d ##pp ##4 - mediated suppress ##ive action of mer ##s - co ##v in macro ##pha ##ges and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogen ##ici ##ty .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatal ##ity rate of over 39 % , and poses a considerable threat to public health . a lack of approved vaccine or drugs currently constitutes a road ##block in controlling disease outbreak and spread . in this study , we generated mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus expression system . electron microscopy and im ##mun ##oe ##le ##ct ##ron microscopy results demonstrate that mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s are structurally similar to the native virus . r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues in ##oc ##ulated with mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s and al ##um ad ##ju ##vant induced virus - neutral ##izing antibodies ti ##ters up to 1 : 40 and induced specific i ##gg antibodies against the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) , with end ##point ti ##ters reaching 1 : 1 , 280 . mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s also eli ##cite ##d t - help ##er 1 cell ( th ##1 ) - mediated immunity , as measured by eli ##sp ##ot . these data demonstrate that mer ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s have excellent im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues , and represent a promising vaccine candidate .  
a cross - sectional study was conducted in egypt to determine the prevalence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in imported and resident camel ##s and bats , as well as to assess possible transmission of the virus to domestic rum ##ina ##nts and e ##quin ##es . a total of 1 , 03 ##1 sera , 1 , 07 ##8 nasal sw ##ab ##s , 13 rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s , and 38 milk samples were collected from 1 , 07 ##8 camel ##s in different types of sites . in addition , 145 domestic animals and 109 bats were sampled . overall , of 1 , 03 ##1 ser ##ological ##ly - tested camel ##s , 87 ##1 ( 84 . 5 % ) had mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##ising antibodies . ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce was significantly higher in imported ( 61 ##4 / 69 ##2 ; 88 . 7 % ) than resident camel ##s ( 257 / 339 ; 5 . 8 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) . camel ##s from sudan ( 54 ##3 / 59 ##4 ; 91 . 4 % ) had a higher ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce than those from east africa ( 71 / 98 ; 72 . 4 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) . sampling site and age were also associated with mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce ( p < 0 . 05 ) . all tested samples from domestic animals and bats were negative for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies except one sheep sample which showed a 1 : 640 ti ##tre . of 1 , 07 ##8 camel ##s , 41 ( 3 . 8 % ) were positive for mer ##s - co ##v genetic material . sequences obtained were not found to cluster with clade a or b mer ##s - co ##v sequences and were genetically diverse . the presence of neutral ##ising antibodies in one sheep apparently in contact with ser ##op ##osi ##tive camel ##s calls for further studies on domestic animals in contact with camel ##s .  
mer ##s - corona ##virus is a novel zoo ##not ##ic pathogen which spread rapidly to > 25 countries since 2012 . its apparent endemic ##ity and the wide spread of its reservoir host ( dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ) in the arabian peninsula highlight the ongoing public health threat of this virus . therefore , development of effective prop ##hyl ##actic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prop ##hyl ##actic ##s or therapeutic ##s for humans or animals to date . different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full - length spike ( s ) protein - based vaccines . here , we investigated the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of naked dna vaccines expressing different fragments of mer ##s - co ##v s protein in mice . we found that pl ##as ##mi ##ds expressing full - length ( ps ) or s ##1 - subunit ( ps ##1 ) could induce significant levels of s ##1 - specific antibodies ( abs ) but with distinct i ##gg iso ##type patterns . specifically , ps ##1 im ##mun ##ization eli ##cite ##d a balanced th ##1 / th ##2 response and generally higher levels of all i ##gg iso ##type ##s compared to ps va ##cci ##nation . interesting ##ly , only mice im ##mun ##ized with ps ##1 demonstrated significant s ##1 - specific cellular immune response . importantly , both construct ##s induced cross - neutral ##izing abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins . these results indicate that vaccines expressing s ##1 - subunit of the mer ##s - co ##v s protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full - length protein - based vaccines .  
saudi arabia has reported > 80 % of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cases worldwide . during april 2015 – february 2016 , saudi arabia identified and tested 57 , 36 ##3 persons ( 18 . 4 / 10 , 000 residents ) with suspected mer ##s - co ##v infection ; 38 ##4 ( 0 . 7 % ) tested positive . robust , extensive , and timely surveillance is critical for limiting virus transmission .  
the virus responsible for middle eastern respiratory syndrome , mer ##s - co ##v is a lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus similar to the mouse hepatitis virus type a ##59 ( m ##h ##v - a ##59 ) . the first reported case of mer ##s occurred in saudi arabia in 2012 and resulted in 76 deaths ( 1 ) . outbreak ##s of mer ##s have since occurred not only in the middle east but south korea as well ( 2 ) . rapid , efficient , and automated methods of di ##sin ##fect ##ing surfaces contaminated with the mer ##s - co ##v virus may prevent the spread of the virus in the healthcare setting . here we report on the use of an automated triple - emi ##tter whole room di ##sin ##fect ##ion system to ina ##ct ##ivate the m ##h ##v - a ##59 and the mer ##s - co ##v viruses on surfaces with a greater than 5 log ( 10 ) reduction on mer ##s in 5 minutes of uv - c exposure .  
to investigate bat corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , we collected 132 rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s and urine samples from five bat species in three countries in southwestern china . seven co ##vs belonging to distinct groups of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like co ##vs and α - co ##vs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats . samples from other bat species were negative for these viruses , indicating that the least horseshoe bat represents one of the natural reservoirs and mixer ##s for strains of co ##vs and has a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses . the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of these strains were described . whole - genome sequencing of a new isolate ( f ##46 ) from a rec ##tal sw ##ab from a least horseshoe bat showed that it contained 29 69 ##9 nu ##cle ##otide ##s , excluding the poly ( a ) tail , with 13 open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . phylogenetic and rec ##om ##bina ##tion analyses of f ##46 provided evidence of natural rec ##om ##bina ##tion between bat sar ##s - like co ##vs ( rs ##33 ##6 ##7 and l ##yra ##11 ) or sar ##s - co ##v ( b ##j ##01 ) , suggesting that f ##46 could be a new rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus from sar ##s - like co ##vs or sar ##s - co ##vs .  
the evolutionary origins of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are unknown . current evidence suggests that insect ##ivo ##rous bats are likely to be the original source , as several 2 ##c co ##vs have been described from various species in the family ve ##sper ##ti ##lion ##idae . here , we describe a mer ##s - like co ##v identified from a pip ##ist ##rell ##us cf . he ##sper ##id ##us bat sampled in uganda ( strain predict / pdf - 218 ##0 ) , further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of mer ##s - co ##v . phylogenetic analysis showed that predict / pdf - 218 ##0 is closely related to mer ##s - co ##v across much of its genome , consistent with a common ancestry ; however , the spike protein was highly diver ##gent ( 46 % amino acid identity ) , suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties . indeed , several amino acid substitution ##s were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block predict / pdf - 218 ##0 from attach ##ing to the mer ##s - co ##v d ##pp ##4 receptor . to experimental ##ly test this hypothesis , an infectious mer ##s - co ##v clone expressing the predict / pdf - 218 ##0 spike protein was generated . rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in ve ##ro cells or primary human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . our findings suggest that predict / pdf - 218 ##0 is unlikely to pose a zoo ##not ##ic threat . rec ##om ##bina ##tion in the s ##1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike ph ##eno ##type and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of mer ##s - co ##v in humans .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from africa and arabia are an established source for zoo ##not ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection among humans . in pakistan , we found specific neutral ##izing antibodies in samples from 39 . 5 % of 56 ##5 dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , documenting significant expansion of the enzo ##otic range of mer ##s - co ##v to asia .  
the world health organization ( who ) published 2 alcohol - based formulation ##s to be used in healthcare settings and for outbreak - associated infections , but ina ##ct ##ivation e ##ffi ##ca ##cies of these products have not been determined against ( re - ) emerging viruses . in this study , we evaluated the vi ##ru ##ci ##dal activity of these who products in a comparative analysis . z ##ika virus ( z ##ik ##v ) , e ##bola virus ( e ##bo ##v ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) as ( re - ) emerging viral pathogen ##s and other enveloped viruses could be efficiently inactivated by both who formulation ##s , imp ##lica ##ting their use in healthcare systems and viral outbreak situations .  
background : approximately , 80 % of the many cases of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) confirmed worldwide were diagnosed in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) . the risk of the disease spreading internationally is especially worrying given the role of ks ##a as the home of the most important islamic pilgrimage sites . this means the need to assess arab pilgrims ' awareness of mer ##s - co ##v is of paramount importance . materials and methods : a cross - sectional study was carried out during rama ##dan 2015 in the holy mosque in ma ##kka ##h , saudi arabia . self - administered question ##naire ##s were distributed to 417 arab participants at king fa ##had extension , king abdullah prayer extension and , king abdullah piazza extension after tara ##wee ##h and fa ##j ##r prayers . results : the mean mer ##s - co ##v knowledge score was 52 . 56 . majority of the respondents ( 91 . 3 % ) were familiar with mer ##s - co ##v . saudi ##s had significantly higher knowledge of mer ##s - co ##v than non - saudi ##s ( 56 . 92 ± 18 . 55 vs . 44 . 91 ± 25 . 46 , p = 0 . 001 ) . females had significantly more knowledge about con ##san ##gui ##neo ##us mer ##s - co ##v than males ( 55 . 82 ± 19 . 35 vs . 49 . 93 ± 23 . 66 , p = 0 . 00 ##6 ) . the average knowledge was significantly higher in respondents who had received health advice on mer ##s - co ##v ( 56 . 08 ± 20 . 86 vs . 50 . 65 ± 22 . 51 , p = 0 . 02 ##4 ) . with respect to step ##wise linear regression , knowledge of mer ##s - co ##v tended to increase by 14 . 23 ( b = 14 . 23 % , p = 0 . 001 ) in participants who were familiar with mer ##s - co ##v , and by 8 . 50 ( b = 8 . 50 , p = 0 . 001 ) in those who perceived mer ##s - co ##v as a very serious disease . conclusion : there is a great need for educational programs to increase awareness about mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been shown to in ##fect both humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s using dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) as its receptor . the distribution of d ##pp ##4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and camel ##s reflects mer ##s - co ##v tr ##op ##ism . apart from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , insect ##ivo ##rous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for mer ##s - like - co ##vs . in order to gain insight on the tr ##op ##ism of these viruses in bats , we studied the d ##pp ##4 distribution in the respiratory and extra - respiratory tissues of two fr ##ug ##ivo ##rous bat species ( ep ##omo ##ph ##orus gambia ##nus and rouse ##tt ##us ae ##gy ##pt ##iac ##us ) and two insect ##ivo ##rous bat species ( pip ##ist ##rell ##us pip ##ist ##rell ##us and ep ##tes ##icus ser ##ot ##inus ) . in the fr ##ug ##ivo ##rous bats , d ##pp ##4 was present in ep ##ith ##elial cells of both the respiratory and the int ##estinal tract , similar to what has been reported for camel ##s and humans . in the insect ##ivo ##rous bats , however , d ##pp ##4 expression in ep ##ith ##elial cells of the respiratory tract was almost absent . the prefer ##ential expression of d ##pp ##4 in the int ##estinal tract of insect ##ivo ##rous bats , suggests that transmission of mer ##s - like - co ##vs mainly occurs via the fe ##cal - oral route . our results highlight differences in the distribution of d ##pp ##4 expression among mer ##s - co ##v susceptible species , which might influence variability in virus tr ##op ##ism , pathogen ##esis and transmission route .  
we tested the suit ##ability of the domestic pig as a model for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . in ##oc ##ulation did not cause disease , but a low level of virus replication , shed ##ding , and ser ##oco ##n ##version were observed . pigs do not rec ##ap ##it ##ulate human mer ##s - co ##v and are unlikely to constitute a reservoir in nature .  
as of january 2016 , 1 , 63 ##3 laboratory - confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection and 58 ##7 mer ##s - related deaths have been reported by the world health organization globally . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus may occur sporadic ##ally in communities or may be transmitted within families or hospitals . the number of confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases among healthcare workers has been increasing . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus may also spread through aero ##sol ##s generated during various dental treatments , resulting in transmission between patients and dentist ##s . as mer ##s - co ##v cases have also been reported among children , pediatric dentist ##s are at risk of mer ##s - co ##v infection . this review discusses mer ##s - co ##v infection in children and healthcare workers , especially pediatric dentist ##s , and considerations pertaining to pediatric dentistry . although no cases of mer ##s - co ##v transmission between a patient and a dentist have yet been reported , the risk of mer ##s - co ##v transmission from an infected patient may be high due to the unique work environment of dentist ##s ( aero ##sol generation ) .  
within a decade , mer ##s - co ##v emerged with nearly four times higher case fatal ##ity rate than an earlier outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v and spread out in 27 countries in short span of time . as an emerging virus , combat ##ing it requires an in - depth understanding of its molecular machinery . therefore , conform ##ation ##al characterization studies of corona ##virus proteins are necessary to advance our knowledge of the matter for the development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies . in this study , mer ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ( pro ) ) was rec ##om ##bina ##ntly expressed and pu ##rified . thermal folding pathway and the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic properties were characterized using dynamic multi ##mo ##de spectroscopy ( d ##ms ) and thermal shift ass ##ay . d ##ms study showed that the pl ( pro ) undergoes a single thermal transition and follows a pathway of two - state folding with t ( m ) and van ’ t ho ##ff en ##thal ##py values of 54 . 4 ± 0 . 1 °c and 317 . 1 ± 3 . 9 k ##j / mo ##l , respectively . an orthogonal technique based on intrinsic try ##pt ##op ##han flu ##orescence also showed that mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) undergoes a single thermal transition and un ##fold ##s via a pathway of two - state folding with a t ( m ) value of 51 . 4 °c . our findings provide significant understanding ##s of the the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic and structural properties of mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) .  
the recent middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , e ##bola and z ##ika virus outbreak ##s ex ##em ##plify the continued threat of ( re - ) emerging viruses to human health , and our inability to rapidly develop effective therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures . many viruses , including mer ##s - co ##v and the crimean - congo hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever virus ( cc ##h ##f ##v ) en ##code de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating ( dub ) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogen ##ici ##ty . they bind and remove u ##bi ##qui ##tin ( u ##b ) and inter ##fer ##on stimulated gene 15 ( is ##g ##15 ) from cellular proteins to suppress host anti ##vira ##l innate immune responses . a variety of viral dub ##s ( v ##du ##bs ) , including the mer ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se , are responsible for cl ##ea ##ving the viral replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s during replication , and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle . together , this makes v ##du ##bs highly attractive anti ##vira ##l drug targets . however , structural similarity between the catalytic cores of v ##du ##bs and human dub ##s com ##pl ##icate ##s the development of selective small molecule v ##du ##b inhibitors . we have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the v ##du ##b activity through a rational protein design approach . here , we report the use of ph ##age - displayed u ##bi ##qui ##tin variant ( u ##b ##v ) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein - based inhibitors targeting the dub domains of mer ##s - co ##v and cc ##h ##f ##v . u ##b ##vs bound the v ##du ##bs with high affinity and specific ##ity to inhibit de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##ination , dei ##sg ##yla ##tion and in the case of mer ##s - co ##v also viral replica ##tive poly ##pro ##tein processing . co - crystal ##lization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between u ##b ##vs and mer ##s - co ##v or cc ##h ##f ##v v ##du ##bs , accounting for the observed binding specific ##ity and high affinity . finally , expression of u ##b ##vs during mer ##s - co ##v infection reduced infectious pro ##geny ti ##ters by more than four orders of magnitude , demonstrating the remarkable pot ##ency of u ##b ##vs as anti ##vira ##l agents . our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein - based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing u ##b ##vs via mrna or protein delivery technologies or through trans ##genic techniques .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) are known respiratory pathogen ##s associated with a range of respiratory outcomes . in the past 14 years , the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have thrust hc ##ov ##s into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogen ##ici ##ty in humans . the study of hc ##ov - host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of hc ##ov pathogen ##esis . in this review , we discuss some of the recent findings of host cell factors that might be exploited by hc ##ov ##s to facilitate their own replication cycle . we also discuss various cellular processes , such as ap ##op ##tosis , innate immunity , er stress response , mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) pathway and nuclear factor kappa b ( n ##f - κ ##b ) pathway that may be mod ##ulated by hc ##ov ##s .  
since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syn ##dro ##m corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of co ##vs . despite this , only 6 % of all co ##v sequences in gen ##bank are from bats . the remaining 94 % largely consist of known pathogen ##s of public health or agricultural significance , indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the ‘ pre - emerge ##nt ’ diversity in bats . our study addresses this critical gap , and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoo ##not ##ic emergence is believed to be highest . we surveyed the diversity of co ##vs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale . we identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters , ninety - one of which were found in bats , and used ecological and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic analyses to show that patterns of co ##v diversity co ##rre ##late with those of bat diversity . this cement ##s bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of co ##v diversity . co - phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to co ##v evolution , and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process . overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of co ##v biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoo ##not ##ic emergence .  
background : in south korea , an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) occurred in 2015 . it was the second largest mer ##s outbreak . as a result of the outbreak in south korea , 186 infections were reported , and 36 patients died . at least 16 , 69 ##3 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms . this paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the mer ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , using data on the spread of mer ##s in south korea . methods : the basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and un ##in ##fect ##ed population . to estimate the basic reproduction number of the mer ##s - co ##v , we employ data from the 2015 south korea mer ##s outbreak and the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model , a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations ( ode ##s ) . results : we fit the model to the epidemic data of the south korea outbreak mini ##mi ##zing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters . also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the sir model . then we determine the basic reproduction number of the mer ##s - co ##v in south korea in 2015 as 8 . 09 ##7 ##7 . it is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 e ##bola outbreak in west africa including guinea , sierra leone , and liberia , which had values of 1 . 5 – 2 . 5 . conclusions : there was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak , thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of mer ##s , such as the basic reproduction number . an evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are st ##och ##astic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak , or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data . such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by korea hospital association .  
host genetic variation is known to contribute to differential pathogen ##esis following infection . mouse models allow direct assessment of host genetic factors responsible for su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . based on an assessment of early stage lines from the collaborative cross mouse multi - parent population , we identified two lines showing highly diver ##gent su ##sc ##ept ##ib ##ili ##ties to sar ##s - co ##v : the resistant cc ##00 ##3 / un ##c and the susceptible cc ##0 ##53 / un ##c . we generated 264 f ##2 mice between these strains , and infected them with sar ##s - co ##v . weight loss , pulmonary hem ##or ##rh ##age , and viral load were all highly correlated disease ph ##eno ##type ##s . we identified a quantitative trait locus of major effect on chromosome 18 ( 27 . 1 – 58 . 6 mb ) which affected weight loss , viral ti ##ter and hem ##or ##rh ##age . additionally , each of these three ph ##eno ##type ##s had distinct quantitative trait lo ##ci [ ch ##r 9 ( weight loss ) , ch ##rs 7 and 12 ( virus ti ##ter ) , and ch ##r 15 ( hem ##or ##rh ##age ) ] . we identified ti ##cam ##2 , an adapt ##or protein in the t ##lr signaling pathways , as a candidate driving differential disease at the ch ##r 18 locus . ti ##cam ##2 ( − / − ) mice were highly susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection , exhibiting increased weight loss and more pulmonary hem ##or ##rh ##age than control mice . these results indicate a critical role for ti ##cam ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v disease , and highlight the importance of host genetic variation in disease responses .  
the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) media ##tes viral entry into target cells . cleavage and activation of sar ##s s by a host cell pro ##tea ##se is essential for infectious viral entry and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for anti ##vira ##l intervention . the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cl ##ea ##ves and activate ##s sar ##s s in cell culture and potentially also in the infected host . here , we investigated which deter ##mina ##nts in sar ##s s control cleavage and activation by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . we found that sar ##s s residue r ##66 ##7 , a previously identified try ##ps ##in cleavage site , is also required for s protein cleavage by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . the cleavage fragments produced by try ##ps ##in and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 differed in their decoration with n - g ##ly ##cans , suggesting that these pro ##tea ##ses cl ##ea ##ve different sar ##s s g ##ly ##co ##forms . although r ##66 ##7 was required for sar ##s s cleavage by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , this residue was di ##sp ##ens ##able for t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - mediated s protein activation . conversely , residue r ##7 ##9 ##7 , previously reported to be required for sar ##s s activation by try ##ps ##in , was di ##sp ##ens ##able for s protein cleavage but required for s protein activation by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . collectively , these results show that different residues in sar ##s s control cleavage and activation by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , suggesting that these processes are more complex than initially appreciated .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) remains a threat to public health worldwide ; however , effective vaccine or drug against co ##vs remains unavailable . co ##v he ##lica ##se is one of the three evolutionary most conserved proteins in ni ##do ##virus ##es , thus making it an important target for drug development . we report here the first structure of full - length corona ##virus he ##lica ##se , mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##13 . mer ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se has multiple domains , including an n - terminal cy ##s / his rich domain ( ch ) with three zinc atoms , a beta - barrel domain and a c - terminal sf ##1 he ##lica ##se core with two rec ##a - like sub ##dom ##ains . our structural analyses show that while the domain organization of ns ##p ##13 is conserved throughout ni ##do ##virus ##es , the individual domains of ns ##p ##13 are closely related to the equivalent eu ##kar ##yo ##tic domains of up ##f ##1 he ##lica ##ses . the most distinctive feature different ##iating co ##v he ##lica ##ses from eu ##kar ##yo ##tic up ##f ##1 he ##lica ##ses is the interaction between ch domain and he ##lica ##se core .  
significant sequence variation of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) has never been detected since it was first reported in 2012 . a mer ##s patient came from korea to china in late may 2015 . the patient was 44 years old and had symptoms including high fever , dry cough with a little ph ##leg ##m , and short ##ness of breath , which are roughly consistent with those associated with mer ##s , and had had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases of mer ##s . after one month of therapy with anti ##vira ##l , anti - infection , and immune - enhancing agents , the patient recovered in the hospital and was discharged . a nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab sample was collected for direct sequencing , which revealed two del ##eti ##on variants of mer ##s co ##v . del ##eti ##ons of 41 ##4 and 41 ##9 nt occurred between or ##f ##5 and the e protein , resulting in a partial protein fusion or tr ##un ##cation of or ##f ##5 and the e protein . functional analysis by bio ##in ##form ##atics and comparison to previous studies implied that the two variants might be defective in their ability to package mer ##s co ##v . however , the mechanism of how these del ##eti ##ons occurred and what effects they have need to be further investigated . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##00 ##70 ##5 - 01 ##7 - 336 ##1 - x ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
we investigated the kinetic ##s of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) neutral ##izing and spike protein antibody ti ##ters over the course of 1 year in 11 patients who were confirmed by reverse transcription pc ##r to have been infected during the outbreak in south korea in 2015 . robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease ; responses remained detect ##able , albeit with some wan ##ing , for < 1 year . the duration of viral rna detection ( but not viral load ) in sp ##ut ##um significantly correlated with the antibody response magnitude . the mer ##s s ##1 elisa antibody ti ##ters correlated well with the neutral ##izing antibody response . antibody ti ##ters in 4 of 6 patients who had mild illness were und ##ete ##ctable even though most had evidence of pneumonia . this finding implies that mer ##s - co ##v ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##olo ##gic studies markedly under ##est ##imate the extent of mild and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection . obtaining con ##vale ##scent - phase plasma with high antibody ti ##ters to treat mer ##s will be challenging .  
background : in 2015 , the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection outside the middle east occurred in south korea . we summarized the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical , and laboratory findings of the first korean case of mer ##s - co ##v and analyzed whole - genome sequences of mer ##s - co ##v derived from the patient . case presentation : a 68 - year - old man developed fever and my ##al ##gia 7 days after returning to korea , following a 10 - day trip to the middle east . before diagnosis , he visited 4 hospitals , potentially resulting in secondary transmission to 28 patients . on admission to the national medical center ( day 9 , post - onset of clinical illness ) , he presented with dr ##ows ##iness , h ##yp ##ox ##ia , and multiple patch ##y in ##filtration ##s on the chest radio ##graph . he was int ##uba ##ted ( day 12 ) because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and in ##f - α ##2 ##a and rib ##avi ##rin treatment was commenced . the treatment course was prolonged by super ##im ##posed vent ##ila ##tor associated pneumonia . mer ##s - co ##v pc ##r results converted to negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged ( day 137 ) , following rehabilitation therapy . the complete genome sequence obtained from a sp ##ut ##um sample ( taken on day 11 ) showed the highest sequence similarity ( 99 . 59 % ) with the virus from an outbreak in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , in february 2015 . conclusions : the first case of mer ##s - co ##v infection had high trans ##mis ##sibility and was associated with a severe clinical course . the patient made a successful recovery after early treatment with anti ##vira ##l agents and adequate supportive care . this first case in south korea became a super - spread ##er because of improper infection control measures , rather than variations of the virus .  
two herds of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s were longitudinal ##ly sampled with nasal and rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s and serum , between september 2014 and may 2015 , and the samples were tested for middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus rna and antibodies . evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection was confirmed in one herd on the basis of detection of virus rna in nasal sw ##ab ##s from three camel ##s and significant increases in the antibody ti ##ters from three others . the three viruses were genetically identical , thus indicating introduction of a single virus into this herd . there was evidence of rein ##fect ##ion of camel ##s that were previously ser ##op ##osi ##tive , thus suggesting that prior infection does not provide complete immunity from rein ##fect ##ion , a finding that is relevant to camel va ##cci ##nation strategies as a means to prevent zoo ##not ##ic transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused fatal infections , some through hospital - acquired transmission , in affected regions since its emergence in 2012 . although the virus is not pan ##de ##mic among humans , it poses a great threat to public health due to its zoo ##not ##ic origin . thus , both prevent ##ative and therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures are urgently needed . in this study , we discovered a panel of neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against mer ##s - co ##v , which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike ( s ) protein of the virus . in addition to mab ##s with neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes located on the receptor - binding domain , one mab , 5 ##f ##9 , which binds to the n - terminal domain ( nt ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 subunit , showed efficient neutral ##izing activity against the wild - type mer ##s - co ##v strain em ##c / 2012 , with a half maximal inhibitor ##y concentration of 0 . 2 μ ##g / ml . we concluded that a novel neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pe for mer ##s - co ##v also resides on the nt ##d of the s protein , indicating that the nt ##d might be important during the viral infection process . our findings have significant implications for further vaccine design and for the development of prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic mono ##cl ##onal im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pies against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
background and purpose : middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) has a high mortality rate and pan ##de ##mic potential . however , the neurological manifestation ##s of mer ##s have rarely been reported since it first emerged in 2012 . methods : we evaluated four patients with laboratory - confirmed mer ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections who showed neurological complications during mer ##s treatment . these 4 patients were from a co ##hort of 23 patients who were treated at a single designated hospital during the 2015 outbreak in the republic of korea . the clinical presentations , laboratory findings , and pro ##gno ##ses are described . results : four of the 23 admitted mer ##s patients reported neurological symptoms during or after mer ##s - co ##v treatment . the potential dia ##gno ##ses in these four cases included bi ##cker ##sta ##ff ' s en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is overlapping with gui ##lla ##in - barre syndrome , intensive - care - unit - acquired weakness , or other toxic or infectious ne ##uro ##path ##ies . neurological complications did not appear con ##com ##itan ##tly with respiratory symptoms , instead being delayed by 2 – 3 weeks . conclusions : ne ##uro ##mus ##cular complications are not rare during mer ##s treatment , and they may have previously been under ##dia ##gno ##sed . understanding the neurological manifestation ##s is important in an infectious disease such as mer ##s , because these symptoms are rarely evaluated thoroughly during treatment , and they may interfere with the pro ##gno ##sis or require treatment modification .  
corona viruses cause common cold , and infections caused by corona viruses are generally self - resolving . during the last 4 years , corona viruses have become the most important viruses worldwide because of the occurrence of several recent deaths caused by corona viruses in saudi arabia . spread of the infection occurred worldwide ; however , most cases of mortality have occurred in the middle east . owing to the pre ##dom ##ina ##nce of outbreak ##s in the middle eastern countries , the virus was renamed a middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) by the corona virus study group . the center for diseases control and prevention and world health organization maintain a website that is updated frequently with new cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection . in this review , we describe the history and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of this novel virus . studies of the genetics and molecular mechanisms of this virus are expected to facilitate the development of vaccines in the future .  
infection by enveloped corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) initiate ##s with viral spike ( s ) proteins binding to cellular receptors , and is followed by pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of receptor - bound s proteins , which prompt ##s s protein - mediated virus - cell membrane fusion . infection therefore requires close proximity of receptors and pro ##tea ##ses . we considered whether te ##tra ##sp ##ani ##ns , sc ##af ##folding proteins known to facilitate co ##v infections , hold receptors and pro ##tea ##ses together on cell membranes . using knockout cell lines , we found that the te ##tra ##sp ##ani ##n cd ##9 , but not the te ##tra ##sp ##ani ##n cd ##8 ##1 , formed cell - surface complexes of dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , the mer ##s - co ##v receptor , and the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se ( tt ##sp ) member t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , a co ##v - act ##ivating pro ##tea ##se . this cd ##9 - facilitated conde ##ns ##ation of receptors and pro ##tea ##ses allowed mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus ##es to enter cells rapidly and efficiently . without cd ##9 , mer ##s - co ##v viruses were not activated by tt ##sp ##s , and they traffic ##ked into end ##oso ##mes to be cl ##ea ##ved much later and less efficiently by cat ##he ##ps ##ins . thus , we identified d ##pp ##4 : cd ##9 : tt ##sp as the protein complexes necessary for early , efficient mer ##s - co ##v entry . to evaluate the importance of these complexes in an in vivo co ##v infection model , we used rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus 5 ( ra ##d ##5 ) vectors to express human d ##pp ##4 in mouse lungs , thereby sen ##sit ##izing the animals to mer ##s - co ##v infection . when the ra ##d ##5 - hd ##pp ##4 vectors co - expressed small rna ##s si ##len ##cing cd ##9 or t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , the animals were significantly less susceptible , indicating that cd ##9 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 facilitated robust in vivo mer ##s - co ##v infection of mouse lungs . furthermore , the s proteins of vi ##ru ##lent mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##vs acquired a cd ##9 - dependent cell entry character , suggesting that cd ##9 is a selective agent in the evolution of co ##v vi ##ru ##lence .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are a huge threat to both humans and animals and have evolved elaborate mechanisms to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) . nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein is the most abundant viral protein in co ##v - infected cells , and has been identified as an innate immunity antagonist in several co ##vs , including mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v . however , the underlying molecular mechanism ( s ) remain unclear . in this study , we found that m ##h ##v n protein inhibit ##ed send ##ai virus and poly ( i : c ) - induced if ##n - β production by targeting a molecule upstream of re ##tino ##ic acid - induced gene i ( rig - i ) and mel ##ano ##ma differentiation gene 5 ( md ##a ##5 ) . further studies showed that both m ##h ##v and sar ##s - co ##v n proteins directly interact ##ed with protein act ##iva ##tor of protein kinase r ( pact ) , a cellular ds ##rna - binding protein that can bind to rig - i and md ##a ##5 to activate if ##n production . the n – pact interaction se ##quest ##ered the association of pact and rig - i / md ##a ##5 , which in turn inhibit ##ed if ##n - β production . however , the n proteins from por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus ( pe ##d ##v ) and por ##cine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( pr ##rs ##v ) , which are also classified in the order ni ##do ##vira ##les , did not interact and counter ##act with pact . taken together , our present study confirms that both m ##h ##v and sar ##s - co ##v n proteins can per ##tur ##b the function of cellular pact to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the innate anti ##vira ##l response . however , this strategy does not appear to be used by all co ##vs n proteins .  
while di ##sp ##ens ##able for viral replication , corona ##virus ( co ##v ) accessory open reading frame ( or ##f ) proteins often play critical roles during infection and pathogen ##esis . utilizing a previously generated mutant , we demonstrate that the absence of all four middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) accessory or ##fs ( del ##eti ##on of or ##f ##3 , - 4a , - 4 ##b , and - 5 [ do ##rf ##3 - 5 ] ) has major implications for viral replication and pathogen ##esis . importantly , at ##ten ##uation of the do ##rf ##3 - 5 mutant is primarily driven by d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated host responses , including disrupted cell processes , augmented inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) pathway activation , and robust inflammation . in vitro replication at ##ten ##uation also extends to in vivo models , allowing use of do ##rf ##3 - 5 as a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine platform . finally , examination of or ##f ##5 imp ##lica ##tes a partial role in modulation of n ##f - κ ##b - mediated inflammation . together , the results demonstrate the importance of mer ##s - co ##v accessory or ##fs for pathogen ##esis and highlight them as potential targets for surveillance and therapeutic treatments moving forward .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and sar ##s - like corona ##virus are a potential threat to global health . however , reviews of the long - term effects of clinical treatments in sar ##s patients are lacking . here a total of 25 recovered sar ##s patients were recruited 12 years after infection . clinical question ##naire responses and examination findings indicated that the patients had experienced various diseases , including lung su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infections , tumors , cardiovascular disorders , and abnormal glucose metabolism . as compared to healthy controls , meta ##bol ##omic analyses identified significant differences in the serum meta ##bol ##ome ##s of sar ##s survivors . the most significant metabolic disruption ##s were the comprehensive increase of ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol and l ##ys ##op ##hos ##pha tidy ##lino ##sit ##ol levels in recovered sar ##s patients , which coincided with the effect of methyl ##pre ##d ##nis ##olo ##ne administration investigated further in the ste ##roid treated non - sar ##s patients with severe pneumonia . these results suggested that high - dose pulses of methyl ##pre ##d ##nis ##olo ##ne might cause long - term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations . the present study provided information for an improved understanding of corona ##virus - associated path ##ologies , which might permit further optimization of clinical treatments .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus , a newly identified pathogen , causes severe pneumonia in humans . mer ##s is caused by a corona ##virus known as mer ##s - co ##v , which attacks the respiratory system . the recently defined receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , is generally expressed in end ##oth ##elial and ep ##ith ##elial cells and has been shown to be present on culture ##d human non ##ci ##lia ##ted bro ##nch ##iol ##ar ep ##ith ##eli ##um cells . in this paper , a class of novel four - dimensional dynamic model describing the infection of mer ##s - co ##v is given , and then global stability of the e ##quil ##ib ##ria of the model is discussed . our results show that the spread of mer ##s - co ##v can also be controlled by decreasing the expression rate of d ##pp ##4 .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic beta ##cor ##ona ##virus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe acute respiratory disease . as of july 28 , 2017 , there have been 2 , 04 ##0 confirmed cases with 71 ##2 reported deaths . while many infections have been fatal , there have also been a large number of mild or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing . new zealand white rabbits are a possible model for as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection with mer ##s - co ##v . in order to discover more about non - lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with mer ##s - co ##v would protect against rein ##fect ##ion , we in ##oc ##ulated rabbits with mer ##s - co ##v and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response . following intra ##nas ##al infection , rabbits developed a transient dose - dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral rna , viral antigen , and per ##iva ##scu ##lar inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs . the rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutral ##izing activity and the animals were not protected from rein ##fect ##ion . in fact , rein ##fect ##ion resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation , without an associated increase in viral rna ti ##ters . interesting ##ly , passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to naive rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection . we further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection . however , rein ##fect ##ion eli ##cite ##d neutral ##izing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge . our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to mer ##s - co ##v who fail to develop a neutral ##izing antibody response , or persons whose neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters have wan ##ed , may be at risk for severe lung disease on re - exposure to mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel virus that emerged in 2012 , causing acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , severe pneumonia - like symptoms , and multi - organ failure , with a case fatal ##ity rate of ~ 36 % . limited clinical studies indicate that humans infected with mer ##s - co ##v exhibited pathology consistent with late stages of ar ##ds , which is reminiscent of disease observed in patients infected with sar ##s corona ##virus . models of mer ##s - co ##v - induced severe respiratory disease have been difficult to achieve , and small animal models traditionally used to investigate viral pathogen ##esis ( mouse , ham ##ster , guinea pig , and fe ##rret ) are naturally resistant to mer ##s - co ##v . therefore , we used crisp ##r / cas ##9 to modify the mouse genome to en ##code two human amino acids ( 288 and 330 ) in the dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 receptor , making mice susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v replication . serial mer ##s - co ##v passage in these engineered mice was then used to generate a mouse - adapted virus that replicate ##d efficiently within the lungs , and ev ##oked symptoms indicative of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , including decreased survival , extreme weight loss , decreased pulmonary function , pulmonary hem ##or ##rh ##age , and path ##ological signs indicative of end stage lung disease . importantly , therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures comprising mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibody treatment or a mer ##s - co ##v spike protein vaccine protected engineered mice against mer ##s - co ##v - induced ar ##ds .  
middle east respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been a significant research focus since its discovery in 2012 . since 2012 , 2 , 04 ##0 cases and 71 ##2 deaths have been recorded ( as of august 11 , 2017 ) , representing a striking ##ly high case fatal ##ity rate of 36 % . over the last several years , mer ##s - co ##v research has progressed in several parallel and complementary directions . this review will focus on three particular areas : the origins and evolution of mer ##s - co ##v , the challenges and achievements in the development of mer ##s - co ##v animal models , and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to mer ##s - co ##v counter the host immune response . the origins of mer ##s - co ##v , likely in african bats , are increasingly clear , although important questions remain about the establishment of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s as a reservoir seed ##ing human outbreak ##s . likewise , there have been important advances in the development of animal models , and both non - human primate and mouse models that seem to rec ##ap ##it ##ulate human disease are now available . how mer ##s - co ##v evade ##s and inhibit ##s the host innate immune response remains less clear . although several studies have identified mer ##s - co ##v proteins as innate immune antagonist ##s , little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection , but rather with ec ##top ##ically expressed proteins . accordingly , considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which mer ##s - co ##v interact ##s with and mod ##ulates the host response . collectively , these areas have seen significant advances over the last several years but continue to offer exciting opportunities for discovery .  
background : molecular detection of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) using real - time reverse transcription ( rr ##t ) - pc ##r ass ##ays is the method of choice for diagnosis of mer ##s . we evaluated the performance of the power ##che ##k mer ##s ( up ##e & or ##f ##1 ##a ) real - time pc ##r kit ( power ##che ##k mer ##s ass ##ay ; ko ##gen ##e bio ##tech , korea ) a one - step rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ay for the qu ##ali ##tative detection of mer ##s - co ##v . methods : we evaluated power ##che ##k mer ##s ass ##ay performance in comparison with nest ##ed rt - pc ##r and sequencing of the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) and n genes . to evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specific ##ity , 100 clinical specimens ( 50 positive and 50 negative for mer ##s - co ##v ) were simultaneously tested by using the power ##che ##k mer ##s and sequencing ass ##ays . ass ##ay performance , including limit of detection and precision , was evaluated in vitro by using mer ##s - co ##v rna transcript ##s . analytical specific ##ity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus – positive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolate ##s . results : the 95 % limits of detection of the power ##che ##k mer ##s ass ##ay for the up ##e and the open ra ##ding frame ( or ##f ) 1a were 16 . 2 copies / µ ##l and 8 . 2 copies / µ ##l , respectively . no cross - react ##ivity was observed . the diagnostic sensitivity and specific ##ity of the power ##che ##k mer ##s ass ##ay were both 100 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 91 . 1 – 100 % ) . conclusions : the power ##che ##k mer ##s ass ##ay is a straightforward and accurate ass ##ay for detecting mer ##s - co ##v rna . the ass ##ay will be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of mer ##s and could prove especially important for mer ##s outbreak control .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a lethal respiratory disease — caused by mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) which was first identified in 2012 . especially , pregnant women can be expected as highly vulnerable candidates for this viral infection . in may 2015 , this virus was spread in korea and a pregnant woman was confirmed with positive result of mer ##s - co ##v polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) . her condition was improved only with conservative treatment . after a full recovery of mer ##s , the patient manifested abrupt va ##ginal bleeding with ru ##pt ##ure of membrane . under an impression of place ##nta abrupt ##ion , an emerge ##nt cesare ##an section was performed . our team performed many laboratory tests related to mer ##s - co ##v and all results were negative . we report the first case of mer ##s - co ##v infection during pregnancy occurred outside of the middle east . also , this case showed relatively benign maternal course which resulted in full recovery with subsequent healthy full - term delivery without mer ##s - co ##v transmission .  
background : emerging respiratory infections represent a significant public health threat . because of their novelty , there are limited measures available to control their early spread . learning from past outbreak ##s is important for future preparation . the middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) 2015 outbreak in the republic of korea ( ro ##k ) provides one such opportunity . objectives : we demonstrated through quantitative method ##ologies how to estimate mer ##s ‐ co ##v ' s trans ##mis ##sibility and identified the effective counter ##me ##as ##ures that stopped its spread . methods : using the outbreak data , statistical methods were employed to estimate the basic reproductive number r ( 0 ) , the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case during its entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population . a transmission dynamics model was also proposed to estimate r ( 0 ) and to identify the most effective counter ##me ##as ##ures . the consistency between results will provide cross ‐ validation of the approaches . results : r ( 0 ) ranged from 2 . 5 with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : [ 1 . 7 , 3 . 1 ] ( using the sequential bay ##esian method ) to 7 . 2 with 95 % ci : [ 5 . 3 , 9 . 4 ] ( using the now ##cast ##ing method ) . estimates from transmission model were higher but overlap ##ped with these . personal protection and rapid confirmation of cases were identified as the most important counter ##me ##as ##ures . conclusions : our estimates were in agreement with others from the ro ##k outbreak , albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreak ##s and sporadic cases of mer ##s ‐ co ##v . the large ‐ scale outbreak in the ro ##k was jointly due to the high trans ##mis ##sibility in the healthcare ‐ associated setting and the korean culture ‐ associated contact behaviour . limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and iso ##lating cases and avoiding high ‐ risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is well known to cause severe respiratory infection and was first reported in the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2012 . we report here the first confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection in the kingdom of bahrain in a saudi gentleman who was admitted elect ##ively for corona ##ry bypass surgery , post ##oper ##ative ##ly developed an acute respiratory illness , and tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v . 40 close contacts , all healthcare workers , were traced and followed with no documented secondary cases .  
the por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus ( pe ##d ##v ) is a corona ##virus ( co ##v ) belonging to the α - co ##v genus and it causes high mortality in infected sucking pig ##lets , resulting in substantial losses in the farming industry . co ##v trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and e ##gre ##ssion , but a detailed description of the intra ##cellular re ##mo ##del ##ing induced by pe ##d ##v is still missing . in this study , we examined qu ##ali ##tative ##ly and quantitative ##ly , using electron microscopy , the intra ##cellular membrane reorganization induced by pe ##d ##v over the course of an infection . with our ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural approach , we reveal that , as most of co ##v , pe ##d ##v initially forms double - membrane ve ##sic ##les ( d ##m ##vs ) and con ##vo ##lu ##ted membranes ( cm ##s ) , which probably serve as replication / transcription platforms . interesting ##ly , we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum and the large vi ##rion - containing va ##cu ##oles ( l ##vc ##vs ) , which are compartments originating from the go ##l ##gi , confirming that α - co ##v assemble ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##ly in two different organ ##elles of the secret ##ory pathway . moreover , pe ##d ##v vi ##rons appear to have an immature and a mature form , similar to another α - co ##v the trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis corona ##virus ( t ##ge ##v ) . altogether , our study under ##lies the similarities and differences between the life ##cycle of α - co ##v and that of viruses belonging to other co ##v sub ##fa ##mi ##lies .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first isolated in 2012 , and circulated worldwide with high mortality . the continual outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v highlight the importance of developing anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s . here , we rational ##ly designed a novel fusion inhibitor named mer ##s - five - helix bundle ( mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b ) derived from the six - helix bundle ( mer ##s - 6 ##h ##b ) which was formed by the process of membrane fusion . mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b consists of three copies of he ##pta ##d repeat 1 ( hr ##1 ) and two copies of he ##pta ##d repeat 2 ( hr ##2 ) while mer ##s - 6 ##h ##b includes three copies each of hr ##1 and hr ##2 . as it lacks one hr ##2 , mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b was expected to interact with viral hr ##2 to interrupt the fusion step . what we found was that mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b could bind to hr ##2 ##p , a peptide derived from hr ##2 , with a strong affinity value ( k ( d ) ) of up to 0 . 24 nm . subsequent ass ##ays indicated that mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b could inhibit pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v entry effectively with 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration ( ic ( 50 ) ) of about 1 μ ##m . in addition , mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b significantly inhibit ##ed spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein - mediated sync ##yt ##ial formation in a dose - dependent manner . further bio ##physical characterization showed that mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b was a the ##rm ##o - stable α - he ##lica ##l secondary structure . the inhibitor ##y pot ##ency of mer ##s - 5 ##h ##b may provide an attractive basis for identification of a novel inhibitor against mer ##s - co ##v , as a potential anti ##vira ##l agent .  
the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections has become a global issue of dire concerns . mer ##s - co ##v infections have been identified in many countries all over the world whereas high level occurrences have been documented in the middle east and korea . mer ##s - co ##v is mainly spreading across the geographical region of the middle east , especially in the arabian peninsula , while some imported sporadic cases were reported from the europe , north america , africa , and lately asia . the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v infections across the gulf corporation council ( g ##cc ) countries still remains unclear . therefore , the objective of the current study was to report the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v in the g ##cc countries and to also el ##uc ##ida ##te on its demographics in the arabian peninsula . to date , the world health organization ( who ) has reported 1 , 79 ##7 laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection since june 2012 , involving 68 ##7 deaths in 27 different countries worldwide . within a time span of 4 years from june 2012 to july 2016 , we collect samples form mer ##s - co ##v infected individuals from national guard hospital , ri ##yad ##h , and ministry of health saudi arabia and other g ##cc countries . our data comprise a total of 1550 cases ( 67 . 1 % male and 32 . 9 % female ) . the age - specific prevalence and distribution of mer ##s - co ##v was as follow : < 20 y ##rs ( 36 cases : 3 . 28 % ) , 20 – 39 y ##rs ( 331 cases : 30 . 15 % ) , 40 – 59 y ##rs ( 314 cases : 28 . 60 % ) , and the highest - risk elderly group aged ≥ ##60 y ##rs ( 417 cases : 37 . 98 % ) . the case distribution among g ##cc countries was as follows : saudi arabia ( 144 ##1 cases : 93 % ) , kuwait ( 4 cases : 0 . 3 % ) , bahrain ( 1 case : 0 . 1 % ) , oman ( 8 cases : 0 . 5 % ) , qatar ( 16 cases : 1 . 0 % ) , and united arab emirates ( 80 cases : 5 . 2 % ) . thus , mer ##s - co ##v was found to be more prevalent in saudi arabia especially in ri ##yad ##h , where 75 ##6 cases ( 52 . 4 % ) were the worst hit area of the country identified , followed by the western region ma ##kka ##h where 298 cases ( 20 . 6 % ) were recorded . this prevalence update indicates that the arabian peninsula , particularly saudi arabia , is the
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel zoo ##not ##ic virus that causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatal ##ity rate close to 40 % , but for which no vaccines are available . here , we evaluated the utility of chad ##ox ##1 , a promising replication - def ##icient simi ##an aden ##ov ##irus vaccine vector platform with an established safety profile in humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , for mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development . using a trans ##genic lethal bal ##b / c mer ##s - co ##v mouse model we showed that single dose intra ##nas ##al or intra ##mus ##cular im ##mun ##isation with chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , encoding full - length mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , is highly im ##mun ##ogenic and con ##fers protection against lethal viral challenge . im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and efficacy were comparable between im ##mun ##isation routes . together these data provide support for further evaluation of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s vaccine in humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , the animal reservoir of infection .  
while dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the immediate animal source of mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , the evolutionary origin of mer ##s - co ##v remains obscure . we analyzed 219 camel and human mer ##s - co ##v genome sequences available in gen ##bank . phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade a and b , respectively , with clade a further divided into lineage a1 ( 3 human strains ) and lineage a2 ( 2 camel strains ) , and clade b divided into b1 to b ##6 ( each containing both human and camel strains ) . rec ##om ##bina ##tion analysis showed potential rec ##om ##bina ##tion events in five strains from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in saudi arabia , with rec ##om ##bina ##tion between lineage b ##5 and b ##3 in four strains , and between lineage b ##3 and b ##4 in one strain . the spike protein showed the highest number of amino acid substitution ##s , especially between a2 and other lineage ##s , and contained positively selected cod ##ons . notably , cod ##on 102 ##0 was positively selected among b and b ##5 strains , and can distinguish between clade a ( q ##10 ##20 ) and b ( r ##10 ##20 / h ##10 ##20 ) strains , suggesting that this residue may play a role in the evolution of s protein during diver ##gence of different lineage ##s . the time of the most recent common ancestor of all mer ##s - co ##v was dated to approximately 2010 . the implications on the role of camel ##s in the evolution of mer ##s - co ##v are discussed .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused human respiratory infections with a high case fatal ##ity rate since 2012 . however , the mode of virus transmission is not well understood . the findings of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and vi ##rol ##ogical studies prompted us to h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize that the human gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire mer ##s - co ##v infection . we demonstrated that human primary int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells , small int ##est ##ine ex ##pl ##ants , and int ##estinal organ ##oids were highly susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v and can sustain robust viral replication . we also identified the evidence of enter ##ic mer ##s - co ##v infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient . mer ##s - co ##v was considerably resistant to fed - state gas ##tro ##int ##estinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fast ##ed - state gas ##tric fluid . in polar ##ized ca ##co - 2 cells culture ##d in trans ##well insert ##s , apical mer ##s - co ##v in ##oc ##ulation was more effective in establishing infection than bas ##olate ##ral in ##oc ##ulation . notably , direct intra ##gas ##tric in ##oc ##ulation of mer ##s - co ##v caused a lethal infection in human d ##pp ##4 trans ##genic mice . his ##to ##logical examination revealed mer ##s - co ##v enter ##ic infection in all in ##oc ##ulated mice , as shown by the presence of virus - positive cells , progressive inflammation , and ep ##ith ##elial de ##gen ##eration in small int ##est ##ines , which were exaggerated in the mice pre ##tre ##ated with the proton pump inhibitor pan ##top ##raz ##ole . with the progression of the enter ##ic infection , inflammation , virus - positive cells , and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues , indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection . taken together , these data suggest that the human int ##estinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for mer ##s - co ##v .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) en ##code a mixture of highly conserved and novel genes , as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogen ##esis , raising the possibility of common targets for at ##ten ##uation and therapeutic design . in this study , we focused on highly conserved non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 16 ( ns ##p ##16 ) , a viral 2 ′ o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( 2 ′ o - mt ##ase ) that en ##codes critical functions in immune modulation and infection . using reverse genetics , we disrupted a key motif in the conserved k ##d ##ke motif of middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ns ##p ##16 ( d ##13 ##0 ##a ) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogen ##esis . while the absence of 2 ′ o - mt ##ase activity had only a marginal impact on propagation and replication in ve ##ro cells , d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant mer ##s - co ##v demonstrated significant at ##ten ##uation relative to the control both in primary human air ##way cell cultures and in vivo . further examination indicated that d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant mer ##s - co ##v had a type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - based at ##ten ##uation and was partially restored in the absence of molecules of if ##n - induced proteins with te ##tra ##tric ##ope ##pt ##ide repeats . importantly , the robust at ##ten ##uation permitted the use of d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant mer ##s - co ##v as a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine platform protecting from a challenge with a mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v strain . these studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2 ′ o - mt ##ase activity for co ##v pathogen ##esis and highlight ns ##p ##16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live at ##ten ##uated vaccine design in an expanding co ##v outbreak setting . importance corona ##virus ( co ##v ) emergence in both humans and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health , as evidenced by the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , mer ##s - co ##v , por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus , and sw ##ine delta co ##v in the 21st century . these studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2 ′ o - mt ##ase activity of co ##vs for at ##ten ##uation . with clear understanding of the if ##n / if ##it ( if ##n - induced proteins with te ##tra ##tric ##ope ##pt ##ide repeats ) - based mechanism , ns ##p ##16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine platform , as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emerge ##nt co ##v strains . importantly , other approaches targeting other conserved pan
background : since its discovery in 2012 , over 1700 confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) have been documented worldwide and more than a third of those cases have died . while the greatest number of cases has occurred in saudi arabia , the recent export of mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) to republic of korea showed that a pan ##de ##mic is a possibility that cannot be ignored . due to the deficit of knowledge in transmission methodology , targeted treatment and possible vaccines , understanding this virus should be a priority . our aim was to combine ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data from literature with genetic information from viruses sequence ##d around the world to present a ph ##yl ##od ##yna ##mic picture of mer ##s spread molecular level to global scale . methods : we performed a qu ##ali ##tative meta - analysis of all laboratory confirmed cases worldwide to date based on literature , with emphasis on international transmission and healthcare associated infections . in parallel , we used publicly available mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s from gen ##bank to create a ph ##yl ##oge ##ographic tree , detailing geo ##sp ##ati ##al timeline of viral evolution . results : several healthcare associated outbreak ##s starting with the retrospective ##ly identified hospital outbreak in jordan to the most recent outbreak in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia have occurred . mer ##s has also crossed many oceans , entering multiple nations in eight waves between 2012 and 2015 . in this paper , the spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al history of mer ##s cases , as documented ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly , was examined by bay ##esian phylogenetic analysis . distribution of sequences into geographic clusters and inter ##lea ##ving of mer ##s - co ##v sequences from camel ##s among those isolated from humans indicated that multiple zoo ##not ##ic introductions occurred in endemic nations . we also report a summary of basic reproduction numbers for mer ##s - co ##v in humans and camel ##s . conclusion : together , these analyses can help us identify factors associated with viral evolution and spread as well as establish efficacy of infection control measures . the results are especially per ##tine ##nt to countries without current mer ##s - co ##v endemic , since their unfamiliar ##ity makes them particularly susceptible to un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble spread of a virus that may be imported by travelers . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##41 ##25 ##6 - 01 ##6 - 001 ##4 - 7 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , such as middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , are important pathogen ##s causing potentially lethal infections in humans and animals . corona ##virus rna synthesis is thought to be associated with replication organ ##elles ( ro ##s ) consisting of modified end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) membranes . these are transformed into double - membrane ve ##sic ##les ( d ##m ##vs ) containing viral double - stranded rna and into other me ##mb ##rano ##us elements such as con ##vo ##lu ##ted membranes , together forming a re ##tic ##ulo ##ves ##icular network . previous evidence suggested that the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##p ’ s ) 3 , 4 , and 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which contain trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains , would all be required for d ##m ##v formation . we have now expressed mer ##s - co ##v replica ##se self - cl ##ea ##ving poly ##pro ##tein fragments encompassing ns ##p ##3 - 4 or ns ##p ##3 - 6 , as well as coe ##x ##pressed ns ##p ##3 and ns ##p ##4 of either mer ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v , to character ##ize the membrane structures induced . using electron tom ##ography , we demonstrate that for both mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v coe ##x ##press ##ion of ns ##p ##3 and ns ##p ##4 is required and sufficient to induce d ##m ##vs . coe ##x ##press ##ion of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##3 and ns ##p ##4 either as individual proteins or as a self - cl ##ea ##ving ns ##p ##3 - 4 precursor resulted in very similar d ##m ##vs , and in both setup ##s we observed proliferation of zipper ##ed er that appeared to wrap into nas ##cent d ##m ##vs . moreover , when ina ##ct ##ivating ns ##p ##3 - 4 poly ##pro ##tein cleavage by mu ##tage ##nes ##is , we established that cleavage of the ns ##p ##3 / ns ##p ##4 junction is essential for mer ##s - co ##v d ##m ##v formation . addition of the third mer ##s - co ##v trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein , ns ##p ##6 , did not noticeably affect d ##m ##v formation . these findings provide important insight into the bio ##genesis of corona ##virus d ##m ##vs , establish strong similarities with other ni ##do ##virus ##es ( specifically , the arte ##ri ##virus ##es ) , and highlight possible general principles in viral d ##m ##v formation .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory illness in humans . fundamental questions about circulating viruses and transmission routes remain . methods : we assessed routinely collected ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic data for mer ##s - co ##v cases reported in saudi arabia during 1 january – 30 june 2015 and conducted a more detailed investigation of cases reported during february 2015 . available respiratory specimens were obtained for sequencing . results : during the study period , 216 mer ##s - co ##v cases were reported . full genome ( n = 17 ) or spike gene sequences ( n = 82 ) were obtained from 99 individuals . most sequences ( 72 of 99 [ 73 % ] ) formed a discrete , novel rec ##om ##bina ##nt sub ##cl ##ade ( nr ##c - 2015 ) , which was detected in 6 regions and became predominant by june 2015 . no clinical differences were noted between clade ##s . among 87 cases reported during february 2015 , 13 had no recognized risks for secondary acquisition ; 12 of these 13 also denied camel contact . most viruses ( 8 of 9 ) from these 13 individuals belonged to nr ##c - 2015 . discussions : our findings document the spread and eventual pre ##dom ##ina ##nce of nr ##c - 2015 in humans in saudi arabia during the first half of 2015 . our identification of cases without recognized risk factors but with similar virus sequences indicates the need for better understanding of risk factors for mer ##s - co ##v transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified on the arabian peninsula in 2012 and is still causing cases and outbreak ##s in the middle east . when mer ##s - co ##v was first identified , the closest related virus was in bats ; however , it has since been recognized that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s serve as a virus reservoir and potential source for human infections . a total of 37 ##6 camel ##s were screened for mer ##s - co ##v at a live animal market in the eastern region of the emir ##ate of abu dhabi , uae . in all , 109 mer ##s - co ##v - positive camel ##s were detected in week 1 , and a subset of positive camel ##s were sampled again weeks 3 through 6 . a total of 126 full and 3 nearly full genome ##s were obtained from 139 samples . spike gene sequences were obtained from 5 of the 10 remaining samples . the camel mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s from this study represent 3 known and 2 potentially new lineage ##s within clade b . within lineage ##s , diversity of camel and human mer ##s - co ##v sequences are inter ##mi ##xed . we identified sequences from market camel ##s nearly identical to the previously reported 2015 german case who visited the market during his inc ##uba ##tion period . we described 10 rec ##om ##bina ##tion events in the camel samples . the most frequent rec ##om ##bina ##tion break ##point was the junctions between or ##f ##1 ##b and s . evidence suggests mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans results from continued introductions of distinct mer ##s - co ##v lineage ##s from camel ##s . this hypothesis is supported by the camel mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s sequence ##d in this study . our study expands the known repertoire of camel mer ##s - co ##vs circulating on the arabian peninsula .  
the past decade and a half has been characterized by numerous emerging infectious diseases . with each new threat , there has been a call for rapid vaccine development . pathogen ##s such as the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and the z ##ika virus represent either new viral entities or viruses emerge ##nt in new geographic local ##es and characterized by novel complications . both serve as paradigm ##s for the global spread that can accompany new pathogen ##s . in this paper , we review the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v and z ##ika virus with respect to vaccine development . the challenges in vaccine development and the approach to clinical trial design to test vaccine candidates for disease entities with a changing ep ##ide ##mi ##ology are discussed .  
although much recent focus has been on the recognition of e ##bola virus disease among travelers from west africa , cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , including travel - associated cases , continue to be reported . us clinic ##ians need to be familiar with recommendations regarding when to suspect mer ##s - co ##v , how to make a diagnosis , and what infection control measures need to be instituted when a case is suspected . infection control is especially critical , given that most cases have been healthcare - associated . two cases of mer ##s - co ##v were identified in the united states in may 2014 ; because these cases were detected promptly and appropriate control measures were put in place quickly , no secondary cases occurred . this paper sum ##mar ##izes information that us clinic ##ians need to know to prevent secondary cases of mer ##s - co ##v from occurring in the united states .  
objectives : during the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in korea in 2015 , the korea centers for disease control and prevention ( kc ##dc ) confirmed a case of mer ##s in a healthcare worker in da ##ej ##eon , south korea . to verify the precise route of infection for the case , we conducted an in - depth ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigation in cooperation with the kc ##dc . methods : we reviewed the mer ##s outbreak investigation report of the kc ##dc , and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from mer ##s . using the media interview data , we re ##af ##firmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure . results : the healthcare worker , a nurse , was infected while performing card ##io ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry res ##us ##cit ##ation ( cp ##r ) for a mer ##s patient in an isolation room . during the cp ##r which lasted for an hour , a large amount of body fluid was splashed . the nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the cp ##r . she suggested that she was contaminated with the mer ##s patient ’ s body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the cp ##r . conclusions : the possible routes of infection may include the following : respiratory invasion of aero ##sol ##s contaminated with mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) through a gap between the face and mask ; mu ##cos ##al exposure to sweat contaminated with mer ##s - co ##v ; and contamination during do ##ffin ##g of personal protective equipment . the mer ##s guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during cp ##r .  
no specific anti ##vira ##ls are currently available for two emerging infectious diseases , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . a literature search covering pathogen ##esis , clinical features and therapeutic ##s , clinical ##ly developed drugs for rep ##ur ##po ##sing and novel drug targets was performed . this review presents current knowledge on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , pathogen ##esis and clinical features of the sar ##s and mer ##s corona ##virus ##es . the rational ##e for and outcomes with treatments used for sar ##s and mer ##s is discussed . the main focus of the review is on drug development and the potential that drugs approved for other indications provide for rep ##ur ##po ##sing . the drugs we discuss belong to a wide range of different drug classes , such as cancer therapeutic ##s , anti ##psy ##cho ##tics , and anti ##mal ##aria ##ls . in addition to their activity against mer ##s and sar ##s corona ##virus ##es , many of these approved drugs have broad - spectrum potential and have already been in clinical use for treating other viral infections . a wealth of knowledge is available for these drugs . however , the information in this review is not meant to guide clinical decisions , and any therapeutic described here should only be used in context of a clinical trial . potential targets for novel anti ##vira ##ls and antibodies are discussed as well as lessons learned from treatment development for other rna viruses . the article concludes with a discussion of the gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research on emerging corona ##virus ##es .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which belongs to beta group of corona ##virus , can in ##fect multiple host species and causes severe diseases in humans . multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin . in this study , we describe the detection and full genome characterization of two co ##vs closely related to mer ##s - co ##v from two italian bats , pip ##ist ##rell ##us ku ##hli ##i and h ##yp ##su ##go sa ##vi ##i . methods : pool of vis ##cera were tested by a pan - corona ##virus rt - pc ##r . virus isolation was attempted by in ##oc ##ulation in different cell lines . full genome sequencing was performed using the ion torre ##nt platform and phylogenetic trees were performed using iq ##tree software . similarity plots of co ##v clade c genome ##s were generated by using ss ##e v ##1 . 2 . the three dimensional macro ##mo ##le ##cular structure ( 3d ##mm ##s ) of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s protein was predicted by sequence - homo ##logy method using the protein data bank ( pd ##b ) . results : both samples resulted positive to the pan - corona ##virus rt - pc ##r ( it - bat ##co ##vs ) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of mer ##s co ##v . phylogenetic analysis showed a mono ##phy ##let ##ic group placed in the beta ##2 ##c clade formed by mer ##s - co ##v sequences originating from humans and camel ##s and bat - related sequences from africa , italy and china . the comparison of the secondary and 3d ##mm ##s of the rb ##d of it - bat ##co ##vs with mer ##s , hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 bat sequences showed two aa del ##eti ##ons located in a region corresponding to the external sub ##dom ##ain of mer ##s - rb ##d in it - bat ##co ##v and hk ##u ##5 rb ##ds . conclusions : this study reported two beta co ##vs closely related to mer ##s that were obtained from two bats belonging to two commonly recorded species in italy ( p . ku ##hli ##i and h . sa ##vi ##i ) . the analysis of the rb ##d showed similar structure in it - bat ##co ##vs and hk ##u ##5 respect to hk ##u ##4 sequences . since the rb ##d domain of hk ##u ##4 but not hk ##u ##5 can bind to the human d ##pp ##4 receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , it is possible to suggest also for it - bat ##co ##vs the absence of d ##pp ##4 - binding potential . more surveillance studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission of known and currently unknown corona ##virus ##es with particular attention
corona ##virus ##es are closely monitored in the context of emerging diseases and , as illustrated with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , are known to cross the species barrier and eventually to move from wildlife to humans . knowledge of the diversity of corona ##virus ##es in wildlife is therefore essential to better understand and prevent emergence events . this study explored the presence of corona ##virus ##es in four wild mammal orders in france : bats , rodents , la ##go ##mo ##rp ##hs , and hedge ##hog ##s . beta ##cor ##ona ##virus and alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus genera were identified . the results obtained suggest the circulation of potentially evolving virus strains , with the potential to cross the species barrier .  
the human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) include hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 , some of which have been known for decades . the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v briefly emerged into the human population but was controlled . in 2012 , another novel severely human pathogen ##ic co ##v — the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v — was identified in the kingdom of saudi arabia ; 80 % of over 2000 human cases have been recorded over five years . targeted research remains key to developing control strategies for mer ##s - co ##v , a cause of mild illness in its camel reservoir . a new therapeutic tool ##box being developed in response to mer ##s is also teaching us more about how co ##vs cause disease . travel - related cases continue to challenge the world ’ s surveillance and response capabilities , and more data are needed to understand une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d primary transmission . signs of genetic change have been recorded , but it remains unclear whether there is any impact on clinical disease . how camel ##s came to carry the virus remains academic to the control of mer ##s . to date , human - to - human transmission has been in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt , but virus surveillance , character ##isation , and reporting are key to responding to any future change . mer ##s - co ##v is not currently a pan ##de ##mic threat ; it is spread mainly with the aid of human habit and error .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which first broken out in jed ##dah in 2012 , causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a high mortality rate . to better understand the molecular characteristics of isolated mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s , we first anal ##yse ##d the cod ##on usage pattern of the zoo ##not ##ic mer ##s - co ##v strains comprehensive ##ly to gain an insight into the mechanism of cross - species transmission . we found that mer ##s human / camel isolate ##s showed a low cod ##on usage bias . both mutation and nature selection pressure have contributed to this low cod ##on usage bias , with the former being the main determining factor . we also observed that gene function , evolution time and the different host species of the virus all contributed to the bias of mer ##s - co ##v , to some extent . additionally , the cod ##on usage pattern of mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s is different from other related ni ##do ##vira ##les viruses isolated from bats and hedge ##hog ##s . in the future , more ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveys are required to examine the factors that resulted in the emergence and outbreak of this virus .  
objectives : the 2015 middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak in korea caused major economic and social problems . the control intervention was conducted during the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case . this study investigates whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective prevent ##ive strategy . methods : the se ##ir ( susceptible , exposed , infectious , recovered ) model with estimated parameters for the time series data of the daily mer ##s - co ##v incidence in korea was considered from may to december 2015 . for 10 , 000 st ##och ##astic simulations , the se ##ir model was computed using the gillespie algorithm . depending on the time of control intervention on the 20th , 40th , and 60th days after the identification of the index case , the box plots of mer ##s - co ##v incidence ##s in korea were computed , and the results were analyzed via an ##ova . results : the box plots showed that there was a significant difference between the non - intervention and intervention groups ( the 20th day , 40th day , and 60th day groups ) and seemed to show no significant difference based on the time of intervention . however , the an ##ova revealed that early intervention was a good strategy to control the disease . conclusion : appropriate risk communication can secure the confidence of the general public in the public health authorities .  
introduction : every year around 150 , 000 pilgrims from bangladesh perform um ##rah and ha ##j ##j . emergence and continuous reporting of mer ##s - co ##v infection in saudi arabia emphasize the need for surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v in returning pilgrims or travelers from the middle east and capacity building of health care providers for disease containment . the institute of ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , disease control & research ( ie ##dc ##r ) under the bangladesh ministry of health and family welfare ( mo ##h ##f ##w ) , is responsible for mer ##s - co ##v screening of pilgrims / travelers returning from the middle east with respiratory illness as part of its outbreak investigation and surveillance activities . methods : bangladeshi travelers / pilgrims who returned from the middle east and presented with fever and respiratory symptoms were studied over the period from october 2013 to june 2016 . patients with respiratory symptoms that fulfilled the who mer ##s - co ##v case algorithm were tested for mer ##s - co ##v and other respiratory tract viruses . beside surveillance , case recognition training was conducted at multiple levels of health care facilities across the country in support of early detection and containment of the disease . results : eighty one suspected cases tested by real time pc ##r resulted in zero detection of mer ##s - co ##v infection . viral et ##iology detected in 29 . 6 % of the cases was predominantly influenza a ( h ##1 ##n ##1 and h ##3 ##n ##2 ) , and influenza b infection ( 22 % ) . peak testing occurred mostly following the annual ha ##j ##j season . conclusions : respiratory tract infections in travelers / pilgrims returning to bangladesh from the middle east are mainly due to influenza a and influenza b . though mer ##s - co ##v was not detected in the 81 patients tested , continuous screening and surveillance are essential for early detection of mer ##s - co ##v infection and other respiratory pathogen ##s to prevent transmissions in hospital settings and within communities . awareness building among healthcare providers will help identify suspected cases .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic virus from camel ##s causing significant mortality and mor ##bid ##ity in humans in the arabian peninsula . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the virus remains poorly understood , and while case - based and ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic , viral sequence data have not been ut ##ilised to their full potential . here , we use existing mer ##s - co ##v sequence data to explore its ph ##yl ##od ##yna ##mics in two of its known major hosts , humans and camel ##s . we employ structured coal ##es ##cent models to show that long - term mer ##s - co ##v evolution occurs exclusively in camel ##s , whereas humans act as a transient , and ultimately terminal host . by anal ##ys ##ing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoo ##not ##ic introduction times , we show that human outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula are driven by seasonal ##ly varying zoo ##not ##ic transfer of viruses from camel ##s . without here ##to ##for ##e unseen evolution of host tr ##op ##ism , mer ##s - co ##v is unlikely to become endemic in humans .  
converge ##nt evolution di ##cta ##tes that diverse groups of viruses will target both similar and distinct host pathways to manipulate the immune response and improve infection . in this study , we sought to leverage this uneven viral ant ##ago ##nism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome . utilizing a systems - based approach , we examined differential regulation of if ##n - γ – dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [ a / influenza / vietnam / 120 ##3 / 2004 ( h ##5 ##n ##1 - v ##n ##12 ##0 ##3 ) and a / influenza / california / 04 / 2009 ( h ##1 ##n ##1 - ca ##0 ##4 ) ] and corona ##virus ##es [ severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ] . cat ##ego ##riz ##ing by function , we observed down - regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both h ##5 ##n ##1 - v ##n ##12 ##0 ##3 and mer ##s - co ##v infection . further examination revealed global down - regulation of antigen - presentation gene expression , which was confirmed by pro ##te ##omics for both h ##5 ##n ##1 - v ##n ##12 ##0 ##3 and mer ##s - co ##v infection . importantly , ep ##igen ##etic analysis suggested that dna methyl ##ation , rather than his ##tone modification , plays a crucial role in mer ##s - co ##v – mediated ant ##ago ##nism of antigen - presentation gene expression ; in contrast , h ##5 ##n ##1 - v ##n ##12 ##0 ##3 likely utilizes a combination of ep ##igen ##etic mechanisms to target antigen presentation . together , the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by h ##5 ##n ##1 - v ##n ##12 ##0 ##3 and mer ##s - co ##v to mod ##ulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response .  
little is known about the effects of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) during pregnancy . in saudi arabia , 5 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection among pregnant women were reviewed , and all cases resulted in adverse outcomes . mer ##s - co ##v infection during pregnancy may be associated with maternal and per ##ina ##tal disease and death .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has recently emerged in the middle east . since 2012 , there have been approximately 2 , 100 confirmed cases , with a 35 % case fatal ##ity rate . disease severity has been linked to patient health status , as people with chronic diseases or an im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised status fare worse , although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be el ##uc ##ida ##ted . we used the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model of mild mer ##s to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogen ##ici ##ty in relation to mer ##s - co ##v shed ##ding . im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed mac ##aq ##ues were in ##oc ##ulated with mer ##s - co ##v and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shed ##ding and replication . im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed mac ##aq ##ues supported significantly higher levels of mer ##s - co ##v replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus , and virus di ##sse ##minated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract , whereas viral rna was confined to respiratory tissues in non - im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed animals . despite increased viral replication , pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed animals . the observation that the virus was less pathogen ##ic in these animals suggests that disease has an im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogenic component and shows that inflammatory responses eli ##cite ##d by the virus contribute to disease .  
background : bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogen ##ic and novel viruses including corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) ( mainly alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ) . lyle ’ s flying fox ( pt ##ero ##pus lyle ##i ) ‘ s ro ##ost ##s and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals . knowledge about age - specific pattern of co ##v infection in p . lyle ##i , prevalence , and viral shed ##ding at ro ##ost ##s and foraging sites may have an impact on infection - age - structure model to control co ##v outbreak . methods : p . lyle ##i bats were captured monthly during january – december 2012 for detection of co ##v at three areas in cho ##nb ##uri province ; two human dwellings , s ##1 and s ##2 , where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm , 0 . 6 km and 5 . 5 km away from the bat ro ##ost , s ##3 . nest ##ed rt - pc ##r of rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) gene from rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s was used for co ##v detection . the strain of co ##v was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis . results : co ##v infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between may and october ( january , in adults only and april , in juveniles only ) . of total rec ##tal sw ##ab positive ##s ( 68 / 36 ##7 , 18 . 5 % ) , ratio was higher in bats captured at s ##1 ( 11 / 44 , 25 . 0 % ) and s ##2 ( 35 / 99 , 35 . 4 % ) foraging sites than at ro ##ost ( s ##3 ) ( 22 / 224 , 9 . 8 % ) . juveniles ( forearm length ≤ 136 mm ) were found with more co ##v infection than adults at all three sites ; s ##1 ( 9 / 24 , 37 . 5 % vs 2 / 20 , 10 % ) , s ##2 ( 22 / 49 , 44 . 9 % vs 13 / 50 , 26 . 0 % ) , and s ##3 ( 10 / 30 , 33 . 3 % vs 12 / 194 , 6 . 2 % ) . the average bc ##i of co ##v infected bats was significantly lower than un ##in ##fect ##ed bats . no gender difference related to infection was found at the sites . phylogenetic analysis of conserved rd ##rp gene revealed that the detected co ##vs belonged to group d beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( n = 64 ) and alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ( n = 4 ) . conclusions : the fact that co ##v infection and shed ##ding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during per ##ip
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in 2012 . the 2015 korea outbreak of mer ##sco ##v involved 186 cases , including 38 fatalities . a total of 83 % of transmission events were due to five super ##sp ##rea ##ders , and 44 % of the 186 mer ##s cases were the patients who had been exposed in nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission at 16 hospitals . the epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government qu ##aran ##tine ##d 16 , 99 ##3 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak . this outbreak provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge of mer ##s - co ##v infection . therefore , in this paper , we review the literature on ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , vi ##rol ##ogy , clinical features , and prevention of mer ##s - co ##v , which were acquired from the 2015 korea outbreak of mer ##sco ##v .  
recently , we developed a mono ##cl ##onal antibody - based rapid nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein detection ass ##ay for diagnosis of mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . in this study , we examined the useful ##ness of this ass ##ay to detect other lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es closely related to mer ##s - co ##v in bats . the rapid mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein detection ass ##ay was tested positive in 24 ( 88 . 9 % ) of 27 ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is bat co ##v hk ##u ##4 ( ty - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 ) rna - positive ali ##ment ##ary samples of ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is pac ##hy ##pus and 4 ( 19 . 0 % ) of 21 pip ##ist ##rell ##us bat co ##v hk ##u ##5 ( pi - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 ) rna - positive ali ##ment ##ary samples of pip ##ist ##rell ##us ab ##ram ##us . there was significantly more ty - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 rna - positive ali ##ment ##ary samples than pi - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 rna - positive ali ##ment ##ary samples that were tested positive by the rapid mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein detection ass ##ay ( p < 0 . 001 by chi - square test ) . the rapid ass ##ay was tested negative in all 51 ali ##ment ##ary samples rna - positive for alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es ( rhino ##lo ##phus bat co ##v hk ##u ##2 , my ##ot ##is bat co ##v hk ##u ##6 , mini ##op ##ter ##us bat co ##v hk ##u ##8 and hip ##po ##side ##ros bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##10 ) and 32 ali ##ment ##ary samples positive for lineage b ( sar ##s - related rhino ##lo ##phus bat co ##v hk ##u ##3 ) and lineage d ( rouse ##tt ##us bat co ##v hk ##u ##9 ) beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . no significant difference was observed between the viral loads of ty - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 / pi - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 rna - positive ali ##ment ##ary samples that were tested positive and negative by the rapid test ( mann - wit ##ney u test ) . the rapid mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein detection ass ##ay is able to rapidly detect lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in bats . it detected significantly more ty - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 than pi - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 because mer ##s - co ##v is more closely related to ty - bat ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 than pi - bat ##co ##v -
human corona ##virus ##es cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans . in 2012 , a sixth human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) was isolated from a patient presenting with severe respiratory illness . the 60 - year - old man died as a result of renal and respiratory failure after admission to a hospital in jed ##dah , saudi arabia . the ae ##ti ##ological agent was eventually identified as a corona ##virus and designated middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . mer ##s - co ##v has now been reported in more than 27 countries across the middle east , europe , north africa and asia . as of july 2017 , 204 ##0 mer ##s - co ##v laboratory confirmed cases , resulting in 71 ##2 deaths , were reported globally , with a majority of these cases from the arabian peninsula . this review sum ##mar ##ises the current understanding of mer ##s - co ##v , with special reference to the ( i ) genome structure ; ( ii ) clinical features ; ( iii ) diagnosis of infection ; and ( iv ) treatment and vaccine development .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high vi ##ru ##lence and case fatal ##ity rate ( about 35 % ) since 2012 . little is known about the pathogen ##esis and innate anti ##vira ##l response in primary human mono ##cy ##te - derived macro ##pha ##ges ( md ##ms ) and den ##dr ##itic cells ( md ##dc ##s ) upon mer ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we assessed mer ##s - co ##v replication as well as induction of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es in md ##ms and immature and mature md ##dc ##s . immature md ##dc ##s and md ##ms were per ##missive for mer ##s - co ##v infection , while mature md ##dc ##s were not , with stimulation of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e up ##re ##gul ##ation in md ##ms , but not in md ##dc ##s . to further evaluate the anti ##vira ##l activity of well - defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells ( ap ##cs ) , three compounds ( ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine and tore ##mi ##fine ) , each with broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l activity in immortal ##ized cell lines , were evaluated in md ##ms and md ##dc ##s to determine their anti ##vira ##l effect on mer ##s - co ##v infection . while ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e was not active in these primary cells , ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine showed strong anti - mer ##s - co ##v activity , but it was associated with high cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city narrowing the potential window for drug utilization . unlike in established cells , tore ##mi ##fen ##e had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells , with high apparent cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city , also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option . these results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells , in addition to established cell lines , before initiating pre ##cl ##ini ##cal or clinical studies for mer ##s treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city in drug screen ass ##ays . furthermore , these studies also highlight the role of ap ##cs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a zoo ##not ##ic respiratory disease of global public health concern , and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the only proven source of zoo ##not ##ic infection . although mer ##s - co ##v infection is ubiquitous in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies across africa as well as in the arabian peninsula , zoo ##not ##ic disease appears confined to the arabian peninsula . mer ##s - co ##vs from africa have hit ##her ##to been poorly studied . we genetically and ph ##eno ##typical ##ly characterized mer ##s - co ##v from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies sampled in morocco , burkina faso , nigeria , and ethiopia . viruses from africa ( clade c ) are phylogenetic ##ally distinct from contemporary viruses from the arabian peninsula ( clade ##s a and b ) but remain antigen ##ically similar in micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization tests . viruses from west ( nigeria , burkina faso ) and north ( morocco ) africa form a sub ##cl ##ade , c1 , that shares clade - defining genetic signatures including del ##eti ##ons in the accessory gene or ##f ##4 ##b . compared with human and camel mer ##s - co ##v from saudi arabia , virus isolate ##s from burkina faso ( bf ##7 ##85 ) and nigeria ( ni ##g ##16 ##57 ) had lower virus replication competence in cal ##u - 3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bro ##nch ##us and lung . bf ##7 ##85 replicate ##d to lower ti ##ter in lungs of human d ##pp ##4 - trans ##duced mice . a reverse genetics - derived rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v ( em ##c ) lacking or ##f ##4 ##b eli ##cite ##d higher type i and iii if ##n responses than the iso ##genic em ##c virus in cal ##u - 3 cells . however , or ##f ##4 ##b del ##eti ##ons may not be the major deter ##mina ##nt of the reduced replication competence of bf ##7 ##85 and ni ##g ##16 ##57 . genetic and ph ##eno ##typic differences in west african viruses may be relevant to zoo ##not ##ic potential . there is an urgent need for studies of mer ##s - co ##v at the animal – human interface .  
the persistent public health threat of infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) highlights the need for an effective and safe mer ##s - co ##v vaccine . in this study , we prepared and va ##cci ##nated mice with either a spike ( s ) protein or inactivated whole mer ##s - co ##v ( iv ) with a combined ad ##ju ##vant ( al ##um + cp ##g ) as a vaccine formulation . similar levels of the anti - s protein i ##gg response and neutral ##izing activity were induced by both the s protein and iv vaccines . in addition , immune responses against three other structural proteins , the envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins , were also detected in sera of mice that received iv . no antigen - specific t - cell immunity was detected after va ##cci ##nation based on the inter ##fer ##on - γ eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ay . mice were trans ##duced with ad ##5 - hd ##pp ##4 after the final im ##mun ##ization and were then challenged with mer ##s - co ##v ( 1 × 10 ( 5 ) plaque - forming units ) . compared with the control group ( ad ##ju ##vant alone ) , mice im ##mun ##ized with the s protein or iv showed slightly lower path ##ological damage in the lung , as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus ti ##ters . mice that received iv formulation ##s also showed increased protective immunity ( almost no live virus was isolated from the lung ) . in conclusion , our data indicate that im ##mun ##ization with our iv formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to im ##mun ##ization with the s protein against mer ##s - co ##v , which should be further tested in camel ##s and clinical trials .  
since the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , there have been a number of clusters of human - to - human transmission . these cases of human - to - human transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings , and they are suspected to result from repeated zoo ##not ##ic introductions . in this study , we sequence ##d whole mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed mer ##s cases in the united arab emirates ( uae ) . these samples included cases from three nos ##oco ##mia ##l and three household clusters . the sequences were anal ##yse ##d for changes and related ##ness with regard to the collected ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data and other available mer ##s - co ##v gen ##omic data . sequence analysis supports the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data within the clusters , and further , suggests that these clusters emerged independently . to understand how and when these clusters emerged , respiratory samples were taken from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , a known host of mer ##s - co ##v , in the same geographic regions as the human clusters . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus genome ##s from six virus - positive animals were sequence ##d , and these genome ##s were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions . these data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human mer ##s - co ##v diversity results from multiple zoo ##not ##ic introductions .  
the pathogen ##esis of highly pathogen ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) remains poorly understood . in a previous study , we established an hd ##pp ##4 - trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g ) mouse model in which mer ##s - co ##v infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secret ##ion of cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es . since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection , in this study , we investigated the role of complement in mer ##s - co ##v - induced lung damage . our study showed that complement was excessive ##ly activated in mer ##s - co ##v - infected hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g mice through observations of increased concentrations of the c ##5 ##a and c ##5 ##b - 9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues , respectively . interesting ##ly , blocking c ##5 ##a production by targeting its receptor , c ##5 ##ar , alleviate ##d lung and sp ##leen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses . more importantly , anti - c ##5 ##ar antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues . furthermore , compared with the sham treatment control , ap ##op ##tosis of sp ##len ##ic cells was less pronounced in the sp ##len ##ic white pulp of treated mice , and greater number of pro ##life ##rating sp ##len ##ic cells , particularly in the red pulp , was observed . these data indicate that ( 1 ) d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of mer ##s ; ( 2 ) excessive complement activation , triggered by mer ##s - co ##v infection , promote such d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation ; and ( 3 ) blockade of the c ##5 ##a – c ##5 ##ar axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by mer ##s - co ##v infection , as manifested by reduced ap ##op ##tosis and t cell regeneration in the sp ##leen . therefore , the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunct ##ive treatment in mer ##s - co ##v cases .  
background : since middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) infection was first reported in 2012 , many studies have anal ##yse ##d its trans ##mis ##sibility and severity . however , the methodology and results of these studies have varied , and there has been no systematic review of mer ##s . this study reviews the characteristics and associated risk factors of mer ##s . method : we searched international ( pub ##med , science ##di ##re ##ct , cochrane ) and korean databases ( db ##pia , kiss ) for english - or korean - language articles using the terms “ mer ##s ” and “ middle east respiratory syndrome ” . only human studies with > 20 participants were anal ##yse ##d to exclude studies with low representation . ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic studies with information on trans ##mis ##sibility and severity of mer ##s as well as studies containing mer ##s risk factors were included . result : a total of 59 studies were included . most studies from saudi arabia reported higher mortality ( 22 – 69 . 2 % ) than those from south korea ( 20 . 4 % ) . while the r ( 0 ) value in saudi arabia was < 1 in all but one study , in south korea , the r ( 0 ) value was 2 . 5 – 8 . 09 in the early stage and decreased to < 1 in the later stage . the inc ##uba ##tion period was 4 . 5 – 5 . 2 days in saudi arabia and 6 – 7 . 8 days in south korea . duration from onset was 4 – 10 days to confirmation , 2 . 9 – 5 . 3 days to hospital ##ization , 11 – 17 days to death , and 14 – 20 days to discharge . older age and con ##com ##itan ##t disease were the most common factors related to mer ##s infection , severity , and mortality . conclusion : the trans ##mis ##sibility and severity of mer ##s differed by outbreak region and patient characteristics . further studies assessing the risk of mer ##s should consider these factors .  
aim and objective : this study aims to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of practicing dental health professionals ( dh ##ps ) ( dentist and dental aux ##ilia ##ries ) toward middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia . materials and methods : a cross - sectional descriptive study was undertaken among practicing dh ##ps in saudi arabia . a total of 202 dh ##ps participated in this study . knowledge and attitude were assessed using self - administered and pre ##test ##ed question ##naire . the question ##naire was administered online through survey monkey ( ® ) program by sending link to the registered e - mail . descriptive statistics were performed on demographic data . mean knowledge and mean attitude scores of dh ##ps were calculated . mann – whitney u - test and k ##rus ##kal – wallis tests were used to disclose the differences between study variables . chi - square tests and spear ##man ' s correlation tests were applied to find the associations between the variables . results : the study participants showed mean knowledge score of 12 . 26 ± 2 . 27 ( based on 17 knowledge questions ) and attitude score of 8 . 63 ± 1 . 68 ( based on 10 attitude questions ) . the spear ##man ' s test showed the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude of dh ##ps about mer ##s ( r = 0 . 09 ##3 , p = 0 . 188 ) . knowledge gaps were reflected in questions related to the duration of in ##fect ##ivity ( 47 . 5 % ) , treatment of mer ##s ( 39 . 6 % ) , reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v ( 38 . 1 % ) , availability of va ##cci ##nation against mer ##s - co ##v ( 25 . 2 % ) , the likelihood of infection ( 24 . 3 % ) , and the type of mer ##s - co ##v ( 23 . 3 % ) . dh ##ps showed a positive attitude toward adherence to universal precautions given by cdc and who ( 0 . 94 ± 0 . 25 ) , active participation infection control program ( 0 . 94 ± 0 . 24 ) , and use of gown ##s , gloves , mask , and go ##ggles while dealing with mer ##s - co ##v patients ( 0 . 97 ± 0 . 17 ) . male dh ##ps showed significantly higher knowledge and positive attitude toward mer ##s - co ##v infection compared to females . conclusion : dh ##ps participated in this study showed good knowledge and positive attitude toward mer ##s . however , still few lac ##una ##e in the knowledge and attitudes toward mer ##s - co ##v were found requiring extensive educational programs .  
background : an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in jordan in 2015 involved a variant virus that acquired distinctive del ##eti ##ons in the accessory open reading frames . we conducted a molecular and ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##olo ##gic investigation to describe the del ##eti ##on variant ’ s transmission patterns and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . methods : we reviewed ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic and medical chart data and analyzed viral genome sequences from respiratory specimens of mer ##s - co ##v cases . in early 2016 , sera and standardized interviews were obtained from mer ##s - co ##v cases and their contacts . sera were evaluated by nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike protein enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys and micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization . results : among 16 cases , 11 ( 69 % ) had health care exposure and 5 ( 31 % ) were relatives of a known case ; 13 ( 81 % ) were sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , and 7 ( 44 % ) died . genome sequencing of mer ##s - co ##v from 13 cases revealed 3 trans ##missible del ##eti ##ons associated with clinical illness during the outbreak . del ##eti ##on variant sequences were ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly clustered and linked to a common transmission chain . interviews and sera were collected from 2 surviving cases , 23 household contacts , and 278 health care contacts ; 1 ( 50 % ) case , 2 ( 9 % ) household contacts , and 3 ( 1 % ) health care contacts tested ser ##op ##osi ##tive . conclusions : the mer ##s - co ##v del ##eti ##on variants retained human - to - human trans ##mis ##sibility and caused clinical illness in infected persons despite accumulated mutations . ser ##ology suggested limited transmission beyond that detected during the initial outbreak investigation .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel human corona ##virus that can cause human respiratory disease . the development of a detection method for this virus that can lead to rapid and accurate diagnosis would be significant . in this study , we established a nuclei ##c acid visual ##ization technique that combines the reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication technique and a vertical flow visual ##ization strip ( rt - lamp - v ##f ) to detect the n gene of mer ##s - co ##v . the rt - lamp - v ##f ass ##ay was performed in a constant temperature water bath for 30 min , and the result was visible by the naked eye within 5 min . the rt - lamp - v ##f ass ##ay was capable of detecting 2 × 10 ( 1 ) copies / μ ##l of synthesized rna transcript and 1 × 10 ( 1 ) copies / μ ##l of mer ##s - co ##v rna . the method exhibits no cross - react ##iv ##ities with multiple co ##vs including sar ##s - related ( sar ##sr ) - co ##v , hk ##u ##4 , hk ##u ##1 , o ##c ##43 and 229 ##e , and thus exhibits high specific ##ity . compared to the real - time rt - pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) method recommended by the world health organization ( who ) , the rt - lamp - v ##f ass ##ay is easy to handle , does not require expensive equipment and can rapidly complete detection within 35 min .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is associated with a wide range of clinical presentations , from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mildly ill to severe respiratory illness including death . we describe isolation of infectious mer ##s - co ##v from the upper respiratory tract of a mildly ill 27 - year - old female in saudi arabia 15 days after illness onset .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one - third of human patients . recent data indicate that dr ##ome ##dar ##ies represent an important source of infection , although information regarding viral cell tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##esis is sparse . in the current study , tissues of eight dr ##ome ##dar ##ies receiving in ##oc ##ulation of mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) after rec ##om ##bina ##nt modified - va ##cci ##nia - virus - ankara ( mv ##a - s ) - va ##cci ##nation ( n = 4 ) , mv ##a - va ##cci ##nation ( mock va ##cci ##nation , n = 2 ) and pbs application ( mock va ##cci ##nation , n = 2 ) , respectively , were investigated . tissues were analyzed by his ##tology , im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , and scanning electron microscopy . mer ##s - co ##v infection in mock - va ##cci ##nated dr ##ome ##dar ##ies revealed high numbers of mer ##s - co ##v - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id positive cells , t cells , and macro ##pha ##ges within nasal tu ##rbin ##ates and tr ##ache ##a at day four post infection . double im ##mun ##ola ##bel ##ing demonstrated cy ##tok ##era ##tin ( ck ) 18 expressing ep ##ith ##elial cells to be the prevailing target cell of mer ##s - co ##v , while ck ##5 / 6 and ck ##14 expressing cells did not co - local ##ize with virus . in addition , virus was occasionally detected in macro ##pha ##ges . the acute disease was further accompanied by ci ##lia ##ry loss along with a lack of dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , known to media ##te virus entry . d ##pp ##4 was mainly expressed by human l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and dr ##ome ##dar ##y mono ##cytes , but overall the expression level was lower in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . the present study under ##lines significant species - specific manifestation ##s of mer ##s and highlights ci ##lia ##ry loss as an important finding in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . the obtained results promote a better understanding of corona ##virus infections , which pose major health challenges .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , first identified in saudi arabia , is an emerging zoo ##not ##ic pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory illness in humans with a high fatal ##ity rate . since its emergence , mer ##s - co ##v continues to spread to countries outside of the arabian peninsula and gives rise to sporadic human infections following the entry of infected individuals to other countries , which can pre ##ci ##pit ##ate outbreak ##s similar to the one that occurred in south korea in 2015 . current therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome . in search of new potential drug candidates , we screened a library composed of 233 ##4 clinical ##ly approved drugs and ph ##arm ##aco ##logical ##ly active compounds . the drug sara ##cat ##ini ##b , a potent inhibitor of sr ##c - family of ty ##ros ##ine kinase ##s ( sf ##k ) , was identified as an inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v replication in vitro . our results suggest that sara ##cat ##ini ##b potent ##ly inhibit ##s mer ##s - co ##v at the early stages of the viral life cycle in huh - 7 cells , possibly through the suppression of sf ##k signaling pathways . furthermore , sara ##cat ##ini ##b exhibited a syn ##er ##gist ##ic effect with gem ##cit ##abi ##ne , an anti ##can ##cer drug with anti ##vira ##l activity against several rna viruses . these data indicate that sara ##cat ##ini ##b alone or in combination with gem ##cit ##abi ##ne can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
the rec ##ur ##rence of new human cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) under ##sco ##res the need for effective therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures . non ##hum ##an primate models are considered the gold standard for pre ##cl ##ini ##cal evaluation of therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures . however , mer ##s - co ##v - induced severe respiratory disease in humans is associated with high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract , which may be difficult to achieve in non ##hum ##an primate models . considering this limitation , we wanted to as ##cer ##tain the effectiveness of using a mer ##s - co ##v infectious clone ( ic ##mers - 0 ) previously shown to replicate to higher ti ##ters than the wild - type em ##c 2012 strain . we observed respiratory disease resulting from exposure to the ic ##mers - 0 strain as measured by ct in r ##hes ##us monkeys with con ##com ##itan ##t detection of virus antigen by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry . overall , respiratory disease was mild and transient , resolving by day 30 post - infection . although pulmonary disease was mild , these results demonstrate for the first time the utility of ct imaging to measure disease eli ##cite ##d by a mer ##s - co ##v infectious clone system in non ##hum ##an primate models .  
corona ##virus tr ##op ##ism is predominantly determined by the interaction between corona ##virus spikes and the host receptors . in this regard , corona ##virus ##es have evolved a complicated receptor - recognition system through their spike proteins . spikes from highly related corona ##virus ##es can recognize distinct receptors , whereas spikes of distant corona ##virus ##es can employ the same cell - surface molecule for entry . moreover , corona ##virus spikes can recognize a broad range of cell - surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can aug ##ment corona ##virus attachment or entry . the receptor of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . in this study , we identified membrane - associated 78 - k ##da glucose - regulated protein ( gr ##p ##7 ##8 ) as an additional binding target of the mer ##s - co ##v spike . further analyses indicated that gr ##p ##7 ##8 could not independently render non ##per ##missive cells susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v infection but could facilitate mer ##s - co ##v entry into per ##missive cells by aug ##ment ##ing virus attachment . more importantly , by exploring potential interactions between gr ##p ##7 ##8 and spikes of other corona ##virus ##es , we discovered that the highly conserved human gr ##p ##7 ##8 could interact with the spike protein of bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##9 ( bc ##ov - hk ##u ##9 ) and facilitate its attachment to the host cell surface . taken together , our study has identified gr ##p ##7 ##8 as a host factor that can interact with the spike proteins of two beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , the lineage c mer ##s - co ##v and the lineage d bc ##ov - hk ##u ##9 . the capacity of gr ##p ##7 ##8 to facilitate surface attachment of both a human corona ##virus and a phylogenetic ##ally related bat corona ##virus ex ##em ##pl ##ifies the need for continuous surveillance of the evolution of animal corona ##virus ##es to monitor their potential for human adaptations .  
the novel middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia ; however , it has not been reported as a cause of acute my ##oca ##rdi ##tis . a 60 - year - old man presented with pneumonia and cong ##est ##ive heart failure . on the first day of admission , he was found to have an elevated tr ##op ##oni ##n - i level and severe global left vent ##ric ##ular sy ##sto ##lic dysfunction on echo ##card ##iography . the serum cr ##ea ##tin ##ine level was found mildly elevated . chest radio ##graphy revealed in the lower lung fields accent ##uated bro ##nch ##ova ##scu ##lar lung markings and multiple small patch ##y op ##ac ##ities . laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause my ##oca ##rdi ##tis . sp ##ut ##um sample was positive for mer ##s - co ##v . cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute my ##oca ##rdi ##tis . the patient had all criteria specified by the international consensus group on cm ##r in my ##oca ##rdi ##tis that make a clinical suspicion for acute my ##oca ##rdi ##tis . this was the first case that demonstrated that mer ##s - co ##v may cause acute my ##oca ##rdi ##tis and acute - onset heart failure .  
background and objectives : describe the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and characteristics of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which are essential for control and treatment . methods : we conducted a retrospective review of all cases of mer ##s - co ##v reported in four cities of the ma ##kka ##h region from march to june 2014 . exposure factors and como ##rb ##id conditions were analyzed using ep ##i info . results : analysis of the 261 cases revealed that the incidence peaked in mid - april 2014 and the fatal ##ity rate was 42 % . cough , fever , radio ##logical evidence of pneumonia , and short ##ness of breath were identified as significant risk factors for a diagnosis of mer - co ##v infection . healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) are at a higher risk of acquiring mer ##s - co ##v than non - hc ##ws . males in jed ##dah are at higher risk due to greater outdoor exposure while females in tai ##f are at higher risk due to domestic care ##giving . filipino nurses are at highest risk among all hc ##ws . conclusion : the findings indicate the need to screen all contacts of hc ##ws to improve mer ##s control and form public – private partnerships to investigate the true burden of mer ##s .  
background and objectives : middle eastern respiratory syndrome caused by novel corona ##virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) has been a major public health challenge since it was first described in 2012 in saudi arabia . so far , there is no effective treatment for this serious illness , which features a high mortality rate . we report an initial experience of the use of rib ##avi ##rin and inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - α ##2 ##b in the management of mer ##s co ##v at a tertiary care hospital . design and settings : a case series of 6 patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of mer ##s co ##v were treated with rib ##avi ##rin and if ##n - α ##2 ##b in addition to supportive management . the patients ’ demographics , clinical parameters , and outcomes were recorded . fifty - four close contacts of these patients were screened for mer ##s co ##v . methods : six patients with mer ##s co ##v infection were included in this study . four cases featured sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic disease , including pneumonia and respiratory failure , while 2 were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic close contacts of the mer ##s co ##v patients . the mer ##s co ##v infection was confirmed by reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction detection of the consensus viral rna targets upstream of the e gene ( up ##e ) and open reading frame ( or ##f ##1 ##b ) on a sp ##ut ##um sample . the patients ’ demographics , como ##rb ##id conditions , time to diagnosis and initiation of treatment , and clinical outcomes were recorded . results : three out of 6 patients who had como ##rb ##id conditions died during the study period , while 3 had successful outcomes . the diagnosis and treatment was delayed by an average of 15 days in those patients who died . only 2 close contacts out of the 54 screened ( 3 . 7 % ) were positive for mer ##s co ##v . conclusion : treatment with rib ##avi ##rin and if ##n - α ##2 ##b may be effective in patients infected with mer ##s co ##v . there appears to be a low in ##fect ##ivity rate among close contacts of mer ##s co ##v patients .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to cause outbreak ##s in humans as a result of spill ##over events from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . in contrast to humans , mer ##s - co ##v – exposed dr ##ome ##dar ##ies develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus - neutral ##izing antibody responses . these strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity mat ##uration as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dr ##ome ##dar ##ies — apart from conventional antibodies — have relatively unique , heavy chain – only antibodies ( hc ##ab ##s ) . these hc ##ab ##s are devoid of light chains and have long complement ##ari ##ty - determining regions with unique ep ##ito ##pe binding properties , allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to ep ##ito ##pes not recognized by conventional antibodies . through direct cl ##oning and expression of the variable heavy chains ( v ##hh ##s ) of hc ##ab ##s from the bone marrow of mer ##s - co ##v – infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , we identified several mer ##s - co ##v – specific v ##hh ##s or nano ##bo ##dies . in vitro , these v ##hh ##s efficiently blocked virus entry at pic ##omo ##lar concentrations . the selected v ##hh ##s bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein . furthermore , camel / human chi ##meric hc ##ab ##s — composed of the camel v ##hh linked to a human fc domain lacking the ch ##1 ex ##on — had an extended half - life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge . hc ##ab ##s represent a promising alternative strategy to develop novel interventions not only for mer ##s - co ##v but also for other emerging pathogen ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic threat of global public health concern and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the source of zoo ##not ##ic infection . although mer ##s - co ##v is enzo ##otic in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in africa as well as the middle east , zoo ##not ##ic disease has not been reported in africa . methods : in an aba ##tto ##ir in kan ##o , nigeria , we tested nasal sw ##ab ##s from camel ##s and investigated 261 humans with repeated occupational exposure to camel ##s , many of whom also reported drinking fresh camel milk ( n = 138 ) or urine ( n = 94 ) or using camel urine for medicinal purposes ( n = 96 ) . results : weekly mer ##s - co ##v rna detection in january – february 2016 ranged from 0 – 8 . 4 % of camel ##s sampled . none of the aba ##tto ##ir workers with exposure to camel ##s had evidence of neutral ##ising antibody to mer ##s - co ##v . conclusion : there is a need for more studies to investigate whether or not zoo ##not ##ic transmission of mer ##s - co ##v does take place in africa .  
the trim ##eric sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) surface spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein consisting of three s ##1 - s ##2 het ##ero ##dim ##ers binds the cellular receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) and media ##tes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes through a pre - to post ##fusion conform ##ation transition . here , we report the structure of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein in complex with its host cell receptor ace ##2 revealed by cry ##o - electron microscopy ( cry ##o - em ) . the complex structure shows that only one receptor - binding domain of the trim ##eric s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein binds ace ##2 and adopt ##s a protruding “ up ” conform ##ation . in addition , we studied the structures of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and its complexes with ace ##2 in different in vitro conditions , which may mimic different conform ##ation ##al states of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein during virus entry . di ##sas ##so ##ciation of the s ##1 - ace ##2 complex from some of the pre ##fusion spikes was observed and characterized . we also characterized the rose ##tte - like structures of the clustered sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 trim ##ers in the post ##fusion state observed on electron micro ##graphs . structural comparisons suggested that the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein retains a pre ##fusion architecture after try ##ps ##in cleavage into the s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s and acidic ph treatment . however , binding to the receptor opens up the receptor - binding domain of s ##1 , which could promote the release of the s ##1 - ace ##2 complex and s ##1 mono ##mers from the pre ##fusion spike and trigger the pre - to post ##fusion conform ##ation ##al transition .  
the molecular mechanisms underlying the severe lung pathology that occurs during sar ##s - co ##v infections remain incomplete ##ly understood . the largest of the sar ##s - co ##v accessory protein open reading frames ( sar ##s 3a ) ol ##igo ##mer ##izes , dynamic ##ally insert ##ing into late end ##osomal , l ##ys ##osomal , and trans - go ##l ##gi - network membranes . while previously implicated in a non - inflammatory ap ##op ##to ##tic cell death pathway , here we extend the range of sar ##s 3a path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logic targets by examining its effects on nec ##rot ##ic cell death pathways . we show that sar ##s 3a interact ##s with receptor interacting protein 3 ( rip ##3 ) , which aug ##ments the ol ##igo ##mer ##ization of sar ##s 3a helping drive nec ##rot ##ic cell death . in addition , by insert ##ing into l ##ys ##osomal membranes sar ##s 3a triggers l ##ys ##osomal damage and dysfunction . consequently , transcription factor e ##b ( t ##fe ##b ) trans ##lo ##cate ##s to the nucleus increasing the transcription of auto ##pha ##gy - and l ##ys ##oso ##me - related genes . finally , sar ##s 3a activate ##s cas ##pas ##e - 1 either directly or via an enhanced potassium e ##ff ##lux , which triggers nl ##rp ##3 in ##fl ##am ##mas ##ome assembly . in summary , rip ##3 - mediated ol ##igo ##mer ##ization of sar ##s 3a causes nec ##rot ##ic cell death , l ##ys ##osomal damage , and cas ##pas ##e - 1 activation — all likely contributing to the clinical manifestation ##s of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to in ##fect humans and camel ##s , calling for efficient , cost - effective , and broad - spectrum strategies to control its spread . nano ##bo ##dies ( n ##bs ) are single - domain antibodies derived from camel ##ids and sharks and are potentially cost - effective anti ##vira ##ls with small size and great expression yield . in this study , we developed a novel neutral ##izing n ##b ( n ##bm ##s ##10 ) and its human - fc - fused version ( n ##bm ##s ##10 - fc ) , both of which target the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . we further tested their receptor - binding affinity , recognizing ep ##ito ##pes , cross - neutral ##izing activity , half - life , and efficacy against mer ##s - co ##v infection . both n ##bs can be expressed in yeast ##s with high yield , bind to mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d with high affinity , and block the binding of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d to the mer ##s - co ##v receptor . the binding site of the n ##bs on the rb ##d was mapped to be around residue as ##p ##53 ##9 , which is part of a conserved conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pe at the receptor - binding interface . n ##bm ##s ##10 and n ##bm ##s ##10 - fc maintained strong cross - neutral ##izing activity against diver ##gent mer ##s - co ##v strains isolated from humans and camel ##s . particularly , n ##bm ##s ##10 - fc had significantly extended half - life in vivo ; a single - dose treatment of n ##bm ##s ##10 - fc exhibited high prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic efficacy by completely protecting human ##ized mice from lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge . overall , this study proves the feasibility of producing cost - effective , potent , and broad - spectrum n ##bs against mer ##s - co ##v and has produced n ##bs with great potential ##s as anti - mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic ##s . importance therapeutic development is critical for preventing and treating continual mer ##s - co ##v infections in humans and camel ##s . because of their small size , nano ##bo ##dies ( n ##bs ) have advantages as anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s ( e . g . , high expression yield and robust ##ness for storage and transportation ) and also potential limitations ( e . g . , low antigen - binding affinity and fast renal clearance ) . here , we have developed novel n ##bs that specifically target the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . they bind to a conserved site on mer ##s - co ##v
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) algorithm for detecting presence of serum antibodies against middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in subjects with potential infections with the virus has included screening by indirect elisa against rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein and confirmation by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent stain ##ing of infected mono ##layer ##s and / or micro - neutral ##ization ti ##tra ##tion . other international groups include indirect elisa ass ##ays using the spike ( s ) protein , as part of their ser ##ological determination ##s . in the current study , we describe development and validation of an indirect mer ##s - co ##v s elisa to be used as part of our ser ##ological determination for evidence of previous exposure to the virus .  
in this study , we report for the first time the existence of complement ##ed pali ##nd ##rom ##ic small rna ##s ( cp ##sr ##nas ) and propose that cp ##sr ##nas and pali ##nd ##rom ##ic small rna ##s ( ps ##rna ##s ) constitute a novel class of small rna ##s . the first discovered 19 - nt cp ##sr ##na u ##ua ##aca ##ag ##cu ##ug ##u ##ua ##aa ##ga , named sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 19 , was detected from a 22 - bp dna complement ##ed pali ##nd ##rom ##e tc ##tt ##ta ##aca ##ag ##ct ##t ##gt ##ta ##aa ##ga in the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome . the phylogenetic analysis supported that this dna complement ##ed pali ##nd ##rom ##e originated from bat beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . the results of rna interference ( rna ##i ) experiments showed that one 19 - nt segment corresponding to sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 19 significantly induced cell ap ##op ##tosis . using this joint analysis of the molecular function and ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , our results suggested that sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 19 could play a role in sar ##s - co ##v infection or pathogen ##esis . the discovery of cp ##sr ##nas has paved a way to find novel markers for pathogen detection and to reveal the mechanisms underlying infection or pathogen ##esis from a different point of view . researchers can use cp ##sr ##nas to study the infection or pathogen ##esis of pathogen ##ic viruses when these viruses are not available . the discovery of ps ##rna ##s and cp ##sr ##nas , as a novel class of small rna ##s , also inspire researchers to investigate dna pali ##nd ##rom ##es and dna complement ##ed pali ##nd ##rom ##es with lengths of ps ##rna ##s and cp ##sr ##nas in viral genome ##s .  
infection by the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes respiratory illness and has a high mortality rate ( ~ 35 % ) . the requirement for the virus to be manipulated in a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level three ( bs ##l - 3 ) facility has imp ##eded development of urgently - needed anti ##vira ##l agents . here , we established an ##ove ##l mouse model by insert ##ing human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) into the rosa ##26 locus using crisp ##r / cas ##9 , resulting in global expression of the trans ##gen ##e in a genetically stable mouse line . the mice were highly susceptible to infection by mer ##s - co ##v clinical strain hc ##ov - em ##c , which induced severe diffuse pulmonary disease in the animals , and could also be infected by an opt ##imi ##zed pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v . administration of the neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies , h ##11 ##1 - 1 and m3 ##36 , as well as a fusion inhibitor peptide , hr ##2 ##p - m2 , protected mice from challenge with authentic and pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v . these results confirmed that the hd ##pp ##4 - knock ##in mouse is a novel model for studies of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and anti - mer ##s - co ##v anti ##vira ##l agents in bs ##l - 3 and bs ##l - 2 ##fa ##ci ##lit ##ies , respectively .  
sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic agent derived from rhino ##lo ##phi ##d bats , in which a pl ##eth ##ora of sar ##s - related , con ##sp ##ec ##ific viral lineage ##s exist . whereas the variability of vi ##ru ##lence among reservoir - borne viruses is unknown , it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation . to understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to inter ##sp ##ec ##ies spill ##over , we studied the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##p ) of sar ##s - co ##v . this key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cl ##ea ##ves the viral poly ##pro ##tein , de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inates viral and cellular proteins , and ant ##ago ##ni ##zes the inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) response . we identified a bat sar ##s - co ##v pl ##p , which shared 86 % amino acid identity with sar ##s - co ##v pl ##p , and used reverse genetics to insert it into the sar ##s - co ##v genome . the resulting virus replicate ##d like sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro cells but was suppressed in if ##n competent ma - 104 ( 3 . 7 - fold ) , cal ##u - 3 ( 2 . 6 - fold ) and human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells ( 10 . 3 - fold ) . using ec ##top ##ically - expressed pl ##p variants as well as full sar ##s - co ##v infectious clones chi ##mer ##ized for pl ##p , we found that a pro ##tea ##se - independent , anti - if ##n function exists in sar ##s - co ##v , but not in a sar ##s - related , bat - borne virus . this pl ##p - mediated anti - if ##n difference was seen in primate , human as well as bat cells , thus independent of the host context . the results of this study revealed that corona ##virus pl ##p con ##fers a variable vi ##ru ##lence trait among members of the species sar ##s - co ##v , and that a sar ##s - co ##v lineage with vi ##ru ##lent pl ##ps may have pre - existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic .  
acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) is immune - driven path ##ologies that are observed in severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . sar ##s - co ##v emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of sar ##s . as with the outcome of human infection , intra ##nas ##al infection of c ##57 ##bl / 6 ##j mice with mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v results in high - ti ##ter virus replication within the lung , induction of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es , and immune cell in ##filtration within the lung . using this model , we investigated the role of the complement system during sar ##s - co ##v infection . we observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following sar ##s - co ##v infection . to test whether this activation contributed to protective or path ##olo ##gic outcomes , we utilized mice def ##icient in c ##3 ( c ##3 ( – / – ) ) , the central component of the complement system . relative to c ##57 ##bl / 6 ##j control mice , sar ##s - co ##v - infected c ##3 ( – / – ) mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung . significantly fewer ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s and inflammatory mono ##cytes were present in the lungs of c ##3 ( – / – ) mice than in c ##56 ##bl / 6 ##j controls , and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e levels in both the lungs and the sera of c ##3 ( – / – ) mice than in controls . these studies identify the complement system as an important host media ##tor of sar ##s - co ##v - induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response to sar ##s - co ##v infection . furthermore , these data suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibit ##ing complement signaling after sar ##s - co ##v infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic .  
a 29 nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on in open reading frame 8 ( or ##f ##8 ) is the most obvious genetic change in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) during its emergence in humans . in spite of intense study , it remains unclear whether the del ##eti ##on actually reflects adaptation to humans . here we engineered full , partially deleted ( − ##29 nt ) , and fully deleted or ##f ##8 into a sar ##s - co ##v infectious cd ##na clone , strain frankfurt - 1 . replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as rhino ##lo ##phus bat cells made per ##missive for sar ##s - co ##v replication by lent ##iv ##ira ##l trans ##duction of the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 receptor . cells from cotton rat , goat , and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which sar ##s - co ##v is neither endemic nor epidemic . independent of the cell system , the tr ##un ##cation of or ##f ##8 ( 29 nt del ##eti ##on ) decreased replication up to 23 - fold . the effect was independent of the type i inter ##fer ##on response . the 29 nt del ##eti ##on in sar ##s - co ##v is a del ##eter ##ious mutation acquired along the initial human - to - human transmission chain . the resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect , which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence . these results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by sar ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes respiratory diseases in humans and has a high mortality rate . during infection , mer ##s - co ##v regulates several host cellular processes including anti ##vira ##l response genes . in order to determine if the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of mer ##s - co ##v ( mer ##s - n ) plays a role in viral – host interactions , a mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibody was generated so as to allow detection of the protein in infected cells as well as in over ##ex ##press ##ion system . then , mer ##s - n was stab ##ly over ##ex ##pressed in a ##54 ##9 cells , and a pc ##r array containing 84 genes was used to screen for genes transcription ##ally regulated by it . several up - regulated anti ##vira ##l genes , namely tn ##f , il ##6 , il ##8 , and c ##x ##cl ##10 , were selected for independent validation in transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed 293 ##ft cells . out of these , the over ##ex ##press ##ion of mer ##s - n was found to up - regulate c ##x ##cl ##10 at both transcription ##al and translation ##al levels . interesting ##ly , c ##x ##cl ##10 has been reported to be up - regulated in mer ##s - co ##v infected air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells and lung fi ##bro ##bla ##st cells , as well as mono ##cy ##te - derived macro ##pha ##ges and den ##dr ##itic cells . high secret ##ions and persistent increase of c ##x ##cl ##10 in mer ##s - co ##v patients have been also associated with severity of disease . to our knowledge , this is the first report showing that the mer ##s - n protein is one of the contributing factors for c ##x ##cl ##10 up - regulation during infection . in addition , our results showed that a fragment consisting of residues 196 – 41 ##3 in mer ##s - n is sufficient to up - regulate c ##x ##cl ##10 , while the n - terminal domain and ser ##ine - ar ##gin ##ine ( sr ) - rich motif of mer ##s - n do not play a role in this up - regulation .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 as a highly trans ##missible pathogen ##ic human beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . the viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) utilizes ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as a host protein receptor and media ##tes fusion of the viral and host membranes , making s essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tr ##op ##ism . as sar ##s - co ##v enters host cells , the viral s is believed to undergo a number of conform ##ation ##al transitions as it is cl ##ea ##ved by host pro ##tea ##ses and binds to host receptors . we recently developed stab ##ili ##zing mutations for corona ##virus spikes that prevent the transition from the pre - fusion to post - fusion states . here , we present cry ##o - em analyses of a stabilized trim ##eric sar ##s - co ##v s , as well as the try ##ps ##in - cl ##ea ##ved , stabilized s , and its interactions with ace ##2 . neither binding to ace ##2 nor cleavage by try ##ps ##in at the s ##1 / s ##2 cleavage site imp ##art large conform ##ation ##al changes within stabilized sar ##s - co ##v s or expose the secondary cleavage site , s ##2 ′ .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , is an emerging disease with high potential for epidemic spread . it has been listed by the who and the coalition for epidemic prepared ##ness innovations ( ce ##pi ) as an important target for vaccine development . while initially the majority of mer ##s cases were hospital acquired , continued emergence of mer ##s is attributed to community acquisition , with camel ##s likely being the direct or indirect source . however , the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure , making the route of transmission unclear . here , using sensitive im ##mun ##ological ass ##ays and a co ##hort of camel workers ( cw ##s ) with well - documented camel exposure , we show that approximately 50 % of camel workers ( cw ##s ) in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) and 0 % of controls were previously infected . we obtained blood samples from 30 camel herd ##ers , truck drivers , and handler ##s with well - documented camel exposure and from healthy donors , and measured mer ##s - co ##v - specific enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) , and neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters , as well as t cell responses . totals of 16 / 30 cw ##s and 0 / 30 healthy control donors were ser ##op ##osi ##tive by mer ##s - co ##v - specific elisa and / or neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter , and an additional four cw ##s were ser ##one ##gative but contained virus - specific t cells in their blood . although virus transmission from cw ##s has not been formally demonstrated , a possible explanation for repeated mer ##s outbreak ##s is that cw ##s develop mild disease and then transmit the virus to un ##in ##fect ##ed individuals . infection of some of these individuals , such as those with como ##rb ##idi ##ties , results in severe disease and in the ep ##iso ##dic appearance of patients with mer ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory disease in humans . although dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are considered as a major reservoir host , the mer ##s - co ##v infection dynamics in camel ##s are not fully understood . through surveillance in pakistan , nasal ( n = 77 ##6 ) and serum ( n = 105 ##0 ) samples were collected from camel ##s between november 2015 and february 2018 . samples were collected from animal markets , free - roaming herds and aba ##tto ##irs . an in - house elisa was developed to detect i ##gg against mer ##s - co ##v . a total of 79 ##4 camel ##s were found ser ##op ##osi ##tive for mer ##s - co ##v . prevalence increased with the age and the highest ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce was recorded in camel ##s aged > 10 years ( 81 . 37 % ) followed by those aged 3 . 1 – 10 years ( 78 . 65 % ) and ≤ 3 years ( 58 . 19 % ) . higher prevalence was observed in female ( 78 . 13 % ) as compared to male ( 70 . 70 % ) . of the camel nasal sw ##ab ##s , 22 were found to be positive by rt - q ##pc ##r though with high ct values . moreover , 2 , 40 ##9 human serum samples were also collected from four provinces of pakistan during 2016 – 2017 . among the sampled population , 840 humans were camel herd ##ers . although we found a high rate of mer ##s - co ##v antibody positive dr ##ome ##dar ##ies ( 75 . 62 % ) in pakistan , no neutral ##izing antibodies were detected in humans with and without contact to camel ##s .  
aim : to assess the knowledge and attitude of senior medical , dental , nursing and pharmacy students toward middle east respiratory syndrome - corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia . subjects and methods : a cross - sectional survey using a 21 - item question ##naire was conducted for a 3 - month period from november 2015 – january 2016 in ma ##kka ##h , saudi arabia . the question ##naire was designed to evaluate students ’ understanding and perception of mer ##s - co ##v . an an ##ova test was used to determine the association of study discipline and academic year with the student knowledge score on mer ##s . results : a total of 36 ##4 students were assessed during the study . the majority ( 62 % ) of the participants were in the 20 – 22 - year age group . more than half ( 53 % ) were pharmacy students followed by ( 22 % ) medical students . more than two thirds ( 71 % ) of the participants were aware that mer ##s is caused by the corona ##virus . more than half ( 59 % ) of the participants believed that mer ##s can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected camel ##s . a statistical ##ly significant association was reported between the study discipline and mean knowledge score ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) with medical students achieving an overall better knowledge score compared with students from other study disciplines . conclusion : overall , students had good knowledge about mer ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , transmission and the recommended protective measures . however , students expressed their reluctance to work in healthcare facilities with inadequate mer ##s infection control isolation policies .  
small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) is a class of du ##plex rna molecules of 21 - 25 nt nu ##cle ##otide ##s in length functioning post - transcription ##ally to down ##re ##gul ##ate targeted gene expression . the membrane ( m ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is highly abundant during viral infections and is a critical element for viral assembly . nu ##cle ##otide substitution in the viral genome occurs frequently during sar ##s - co ##v infection . in the current study , we analyzed the m gene sequences derived from 15 sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s and uncovered six nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s among these isolate ##s . interesting ##ly , these nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s are all located at the 5 ’ half of the m gene . based on this information and previous reports , we created two novel sir ##nas targeting two une ##x ##pl ##ored and well conserved regions in the m gene . the effects of these two sir ##nas were tested by semi - quantitative rt - pc ##r and e ##gf ##p - m fusion gene expression . the results demonstrated that both sir ##nas effectively and specifically blocked the targeted gene expression . real time quantitative rt - pc ##r ( q ##rt - pc ##r ) revealed that sir ##na targeting the 3 ’ half of the m gene ( si - m2 ) induced more potent inhibition than that targeting the 5 ’ half ( si - m1 ) . both si - m1 and si - m2 significantly down ##re ##gul ##ated m gene mediated up ##re ##gul ##ation of inter ##fer ##on β expression . thus , our results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v m gene specific sir ##na might function in a sequence - dependent manner .  
super - spreading events have been observed in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases . the 2015 mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in the republic of korea has also shown super - spreading events with a significantly high level of het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in generating secondary cases . it becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y to develop effective intervention strategies and prevent ##ive plans for future emerging infectious diseases . in this regard , agent - based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y into the epidemic model . in the present work , a st ##och ##astic agent - based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y . clinical ( i . e . , an in ##fect ##ivity level ) and social or environmental ( i . e . , a contact level ) het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y are modeled . these factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super - spread ##ers have stronger transmission and / or higher links . our agent - based model has employed real mer ##s - co ##v epidemic features based on the 2015 mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data . monte carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios . our findings highlight the roles of super - spread ##ers in a high level of het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y , under ##sco ##ring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of in ##fect ##ivity are the most critical factors for substantial het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in generating secondary cases of the 2015 mer ##s - co ##v transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v , was identified in saudi arabia in 2012 , and as of january 29 , 2018 , there were 2 , 123 laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases reported to who ( who , 2018 , https : / / www . who . int / emergencies / mer ##s - co ##v / en / ) . multiple studies suggest that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are a source for human mer ##s - co ##v infection . mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s across northern africa and across the arabian peninsula . israel ’ s geographic location places israel at risk for mer ##s - co ##v infection . to date , mer ##s - co ##v - related illness has not been reported and the burden of mer ##s - co ##v infection in the israeli population is unknown . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies in israeli dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s is unknown . the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in israel . the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies in israeli camel ##s was examined in 71 camel sera collected from four farms across israel by mer ##s - co ##v - specific micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ( mn ##t ) ass ##ay and confirmed by mer ##s - co ##v - specific im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) . although this study cannot rule out potential antibody cross - react ##ivity by if ##a , the presence of bo ##vine corona ##virus - specific antibodies do not appear to impact detection of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies by mn ##t . mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies were detect ##able in 51 ( 71 . 8 % ) camel sera , and no association was observed between the presence of neutral ##izing antibodies and camel age or gender . these findings extend the known range of mer ##s - co ##v circulation in middle eastern camel ##s . the high rate of mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibody ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the absence of any reported human mer ##s cases suggests that there is still much to be learned about the dynamics of camel - to - human transmission of mer ##s - co ##v .  
previous findings of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) - related viruses in bats , and the ability of ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 spike protein to utilize mer ##s - co ##v receptor , human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 hd ##pp ##4 , suggest a bat ancestral origin of mer ##s - co ##v . we developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species , including ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is pac ##hy ##pus , pip ##ist ##rell ##us ab ##ram ##us and rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus ( hosts of ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 , pip ##ist ##rell ##us - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 , and sar ##s - related - co ##v respectively ) , and tested their su ##sc ##ept ##ib ##ili ##ties to mer ##s - co ##vs , sar ##s - co ##v , and human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) . five cell lines , including p . ab ##ram ##us and r . sin ##icus but not t . pac ##hy ##pus cells , were susceptible to human mer ##s - co ##v em ##c / 2012 . however , three tested camel mer ##s - co ##v strains showed different in ##fect ##iv ##ities , with only two strains capable of in ##fect ##ing three and one cell lines respectively . sar ##s - co ##v can only replicate in r . sin ##icus cells , while hc ##ov - 229 ##e cannot replicate in any bat cells . bat dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) sequences were closely related to those of human and non - human primate ##s but distinct from dr ##ome ##dar ##y d ##pp ##4 sequence . critical residues for binding to mer ##s - co ##v spike protein were mostly conserved in bat d ##pp ##4 . d ##pp ##4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v , with significantly higher mrna expression levels than those in non - susceptible cells ( p = 0 . 01 ##7 ##4 ) , supporting that d ##pp ##4 expression is critical for mer ##s - co ##v infection in bats . however , over ##ex ##press ##ion of t . pac ##hy ##pus d ##pp ##4 failed to con ##fer mer ##s - co ##v su ##sc ##ept ##ibility in t . pac ##hy ##pus cells , suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication . the broad cellular tr ##op ##ism of mer ##s - co ##v should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin .  
we report a case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in a 61 - year - old businessman returning from kuwait . the patient arrived there on august 16 , 2018 , developed watery dia ##rr ##hea on august 28 ( day 0 ) , and came back to korea on september 7 ( day 10 ) as his condition worsened . upon arrival , he complained of dia ##rr ##hea and weakness , but denied any respiratory symptoms , and he directly went to visit an emergency room . chest radio ##graphy revealed inter ##sti ##tial infiltrate ##s in the lungs , and he was immediately transferred to an isolation unit . quantitative real - time pc ##r analysis of sp ##ut ##um samples taken on day 11 returned positive for mer ##s - co ##v . no secondary mer ##s - co ##v infection was identified among people who had close contact with him . this case under ##sco ##res the importance of a high index of suspicion of mer ##s - co ##v infection in any feb ##ril ##e patients who present after a trip to the middle east .  
since emerging in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been a global public health threat with a high fatal ##ity rate and worldwide distribution . there are no approved vaccines or the ##ra ##pies for mer ##s until now . passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py with neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) is an effective prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic re ##age ##nt against emerging viruses . in this article , we review current advances in neutral ##izing mab ##s against mer ##s - co ##v . the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v is a major target , and mouse , camel , or human - derived neutral ##izing mab ##s targeting rb ##d have been developed . a major problem with neutral ##izing mab therapy is mutant escape under selective pressure , which can be solved by combination of neutral ##izing mab ##s targeting different ep ##ito ##pes . neutral ##izing mab ##s are currently under pre ##cl ##ini ##cal evaluation , and they are promising candidate therapeutic agents against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) with potential to cause global pan ##de ##mics remains a threat to the public health , security , and economy . in this review , we focus on advances in the research and development of small - molecule mer ##s - co ##v inhibitors targeting different stages of the mer ##s - co ##v life cycle , aiming to prevent or treat mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like wi ##v ##1 - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) was first isolated from rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus bats and can use the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor . in the current study , we investigate the ability of wi ##v ##1 - co ##v to in ##fect rouse ##tt ##us ae ##gy ##pt ##iac ##us bats . no clinical signs were observed throughout the experiment . furthermore , only four oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s and two respiratory tissues , isolated on day 3 post in ##oc ##ulation , were found positive for viral rna . two out of twelve bats showed a modest increase in corona ##virus specific antibodies post challenge . in conclusion , wi ##v ##1 - co ##v was unable to cause a robust infection in rouse ##tt ##us ae ##gy ##pt ##iac ##us bats .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a novel infectious agent causing severe respiratory disease and death in humans , was first described in 2012 . antibodies directed against the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling mer ##s - co ##v infection and in media ##ting vaccine - induced protective immunity . in contrast , relatively little is known about the role of t cell responses and the antigen ##ic targets of mer ##s - co ##v that are recognized by cd ##8 + t cells . in this study , the highly conserved mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein served as a target im ##mun ##ogen to eli ##cit mer ##s - co ##v - specific cellular immune responses . modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) , a safety - tested strain of va ##cci ##nia virus for pre ##cl ##ini ##cal and clinical vaccine research , was used for generating mv ##a - mer ##s - n expressing rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein . overlapping peptide ##s spanning the whole mer ##s - co ##v n poly ##pe ##pt ##ide were used to identify major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex class i / ii - restricted t cell responses in bal ##b / c mice im ##mun ##ized with mv ##a - mer ##s - n . we have identified a h ##2 - d restricted dec ##ame ##r peptide ep ##ito ##pe in the mer ##s - n protein with cd ##8 + t cell antigen ##ici ##ty . the identification of this ep ##ito ##pe , and the availability of the mv ##a - mer ##s - n candidate vaccine , will help to evaluate mer ##s - n - specific immune responses and the potential immune co ##rre ##lates of vaccine - mediated protection in the appropriate mu ##rine models of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) poses a threat to public health . the virus is endemic in the middle east but can be transmitted to other countries by travel activity . the introduction of mer ##s - co ##v into the republic of korea by an infected traveler resulted in a hospital outbreak of mer ##s that en ##tail ##ed 186 cases and 38 deaths . the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein binds to the cellular protein d ##pp ##4 via its receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) and media ##tes viral entry into target cells . during the mer ##s outbreak in korea , emergence and spread of viral variants that harbor ##ed mutations in the rb ##d , d ##51 ##0 ##g and i ##52 ##9 ##t , was observed . counter ##int ##uit ##ively , these mutations were found to reduce d ##pp ##4 binding and viral entry into target cells . in this study , we investigated whether they also ex ##erted pro ##vira ##l effects . we confirm that changes d ##51 ##0 ##g and i ##52 ##9 ##t reduce s protein binding to d ##pp ##4 but show that this reduction only translates into diminished viral entry when expression of d ##pp ##4 on target cells is low . neither mutation mod ##ulated s protein binding to si ##alic acids , s protein activation by host cell pro ##tea ##ses , or inhibition of s protein - driven entry by inter ##fer ##on - induced trans ##me ##mb ##rane proteins . in contrast , changes d ##51 ##0 ##g and i ##52 ##9 ##t increased resistance of s protein - driven entry to neutral ##ization by mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and sera from mer ##s patients . these findings indicate that mer ##s - co ##v variants with reduced neutral ##ization sensitivity were transmitted during the korean outbreak and that the responsible mutations were compatible with robust infection of cells expressing high levels of d ##pp ##4 . importance mer ##s - co ##v has pan ##de ##mic potential , and it is important to identify mutations in viral proteins that might aug ##ment viral spread . in the course of a large hospital outbreak of mer ##s in the republic of korea in 2015 , the spread of a viral variant that contained mutations in the viral spike protein was observed . these mutations were found to reduce receptor binding and viral in ##fect ##ivity . however , it remained unclear whether they also ex ##erted pro ##vira ##l effects . we demonstrate that these mutations reduce sensitivity to antibody - mediated neutral ##ization and are compatible with robust infection of target cells expressing large amounts of the viral receptor d ##pp ##4 .  
we describe the first genome isolation of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in kenya . this fatal zoo ##not ##ic pathogen was first described in the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2012 . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and molecular evidence revealed zoo ##not ##ic transmission from camel ##s to humans and between humans . currently , mer ##s - co ##v is classified by the who as having high pan ##de ##mic potential requiring greater surveillance . previous studies of mer ##s - co ##v in kenya mainly focused on site - specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies . we conducted active nationwide cross - sectional surveillance of camel ##s and humans in kenya , targeting both nasal sw ##ab ##s and plasma samples from 1 , 163 camel ##s and 48 ##6 humans collected from january 2016 to june 2018 . a total of 79 ##2 camel plasma samples were positive by elisa . ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce increased with age , and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camel ##s ( 82 . 37 % , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 79 . 50 – 84 . 91 ) . more female camel ##s were significantly ser ##op ##osi ##tive ( 74 . 28 % , 95 % ci 71 . 14 – 77 . 19 ) than male camel ##s ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( 53 . 74 % , 95 % ci 48 . 48 – 58 . 90 ) . only 11 camel nasal sw ##ab ##s were positive for mer ##s - co ##v by reverse transcription - quantitative pc ##r . phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that kenyan mer ##s - co ##v clustered within sub - clade c2 , which is associated with the african clade , but did not contain signature del ##eti ##ons of or ##f ##4 ##b in african viruses . none of the human plasma screened contained neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v . this study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of mer ##s - co ##v in kenyan camel ##s . further one - health surveillance approaches in camel ##s , wildlife , and human populations are needed . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##12 ##25 ##0 - 01 ##8 - 00 ##7 ##6 - 4 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
efforts towards developing a vaccine for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have yielded promising results . utilizing a variety of platforms , several vaccine approaches have shown efficacy in animal models and begun to enter clinical trials . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the current progress towards a mer ##s - co ##v vaccine and highlight potential road ##block ##s identified from previous attempts to generate corona ##virus vaccines .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has continuously posed a threat to public health worldwide , yet no therapeutic ##s or vaccines are currently available to prevent or treat mer ##s - co ##v infection . we previously identified a fusion inhibitor ##y peptide ( hr ##2 ##p - m2 ) targeting the mer ##s - co ##v s ##2 protein hr ##1 domain and a highly potent neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( m3 ##36 ) specific to the s ##1 spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . however , m3 ##36 was found to have reduced efficacy against mer ##s - co ##v strains with mutations in rb ##d , and hr ##2 ##p - m2 showed low pot ##ency , thus limiting the clinical application of each when administered separately . however , we here ##in report that the combination of m3 ##36 and hr ##2 ##p - m2 exhibited potent syn ##er ##gis ##m in inhibit ##ing mer ##s - co ##v s protein - mediated cell – cell fusion and infection by mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus ##es with or without mutations in the rb ##d , resulting in the enhancement of anti ##vira ##l activity in contrast to either one administered alone . thus , this comb ##inator ##ial strategy could be used in clinics for the urgent treatment of mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic virus with a crude mortality rate of ~ 35 % . previously , we established a human d ##pp ##4 trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g ) mouse model in which we studied complement over ##act ##ivation - induced im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogen ##esis . here , to better understand the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v , we studied the role of p ##yr ##op ##tosis in th ##p - 1 cells and hd ##pp ##4 t ##g mice with mer ##s - co ##v infection . we found that mer ##s - co ##v infection induced p ##yr ##op ##tosis and over - activation of complement in human macro ##pha ##ges . the hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g mice infected with mer ##s - co ##v over ##ex ##pressed cas ##pas ##e - 1 in the sp ##leen and showed high il - 1 ##β levels in serum , suggesting that p ##yr ##op ##tosis occurred after infection . however , when the c ##5 ##a - c ##5 ##ar ##1 axis was blocked by an anti - c ##5 ##ar ##1 antibody ( ab ) , expression of cas ##pas ##e - 1 and il - 1 ##β fell . these data indicate that mer ##s - co ##v infection induce ##s over ##act ##ivation of complement , which may contribute to p ##yr ##op ##tosis and inflammation . p ##yr ##op ##tosis and inflammation were suppressed by inhibit ##ing c ##5 ##ar ##1 . these results will further our understanding of the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
mer ##s - co ##v ( middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ) antibodies were detected in camel ##s since 1983 , but the first human case was only detected in 2012 . this study sought to identify and quan ##tify possible drivers for the mer ##s - co ##v emergence and spill ##over to humans . a list of potential human , animal and environmental drivers for disease emergence were identified from literature . trends in possible drivers were analyzed from national and international databases , and through structured interviews with experts in qatar . the discovery and exploitation of oil and gas led to a 5 - fold increase in qatar gdp coupled with a 7 - fold population growth in the past 30 years . the lifestyle gradually transformed from bed ##ouin life to urban se ##dent ##ary life , along with a sharp increase in obesity and other como ##rb ##idi ##ties . owing to substantial governmental support , camel husband ##ry and competitions flourished , ex ##ace ##rba ##ting the already rapidly occurring desert ##ification that forced banning of free grazing in 2005 . consequently , camel ##s were housed in compact barns alongside their workers . the transition in husband ##ry leading to high density camel farming along with increased exposure to humans , combined with the increase of camel movement for the racing and breeding industry , have led to a convergence of factors driving spill ##over of mer ##s - co ##v from camel ##s to humans .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012 . the mer ##s - co ##v genome en ##codes four major structural proteins , among which the spike ( s ) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogen ##esis . the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the s protein contains a critical neutral ##izing domain and is an important target for development of mer ##s vaccines and therapeutic ##s . in this review , we describe the relevant features of the mer ##s - co ##v s - protein rb ##d , sum ##mar ##ize recent advances in the development of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies , and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 and caused continual outbreak ##s worldwide with high mortality . however , no effective anti - mer ##s - co ##v drug is currently available . recently , numerous evolutionary studies have suggested that mer ##s - co ##v originated from bat corona ##virus ( bat ##co ##v ) . we here ##in reported that three peptide ##s derived from the hr ##2 region in spike protein of bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 , including hk ##u ##4 - hr ##2 ##p ##1 , hk ##u ##4 - hr ##2 ##p ##2 and hk ##u ##4 - hr ##2 ##p ##3 , could bind the mer ##s - co ##v hr ##1 - derived peptide to form a six - helix bundle ( 6 - h ##b ) with high stability . moreover , these peptide ##s , particularly hk ##u ##4 - hr ##2 ##p ##2 and hk ##u ##4 - hr ##2 ##p ##3 , exhibited potent inhibitor ##y activity against mer ##s - co ##v s - mediated cell – cell fusion and viral infection , suggesting that these hk ##u ##4 hr ##2 - derived peptide ##s could be candidates for fu ##ther development as anti ##vira ##l agents against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogen ##s to humans . however , two outbreak ##s of severe respiratory tract infection , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , as a result of zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs crossing the species barrier , caused high pathogen ##ici ##ty and mortality rates in human populations . this brought co ##vs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogen ##s at international borders . in this review , we focus on our current understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , pathogen ##esis , prevention , and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins ( s proteins ) on the surface of each of these viruses . for building up more suitable animal models , we compare the current animal models rec ##ap ##it ##ulating pathogen ##esis and sum ##mar ##ize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species . we outline the research still needed to fully el ##uc ##ida ##te the pathogen ##ic mechanism of these viruses , to construct rep ##rod ##ucible animal models , and ultimately develop counter ##me ##as ##ures to conquer not only sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , but also these emerging corona ##vira ##l diseases .  
diagnostic ##s play a central role in the early detection and control of outbreak ##s and can enable a more nu ##ance ##d understanding of the disease kinetic ##s and risk factors for the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , one of the high - priority pathogen ##s identified by the who . in this review we identified sources for molecular and ser ##ological diagnostic tests used in mer ##s - co ##v detection , case management and outbreak investigations , as well as surveillance for humans and animals ( camel ##s ) , and sum ##mar ##ised the performance of currently available tests , diagnostic needs , and associated challenges for diagnostic test development and implementation . a more detailed understanding of the kinetic ##s of infection of mer ##s - co ##v is needed in order to opt ##imi ##se the use of existing ass ##ays . notably , mer ##s - co ##v point - of - care tests are needed in order to opt ##imi ##se supportive care and to mini ##mise transmission risk . however , for new test development , sour ##cing clinical material continues to be a major challenge to achieving ass ##ay validation . harmon ##isation and standard ##isation of laboratory methods are essential for surveillance and for a rapid and effective international response to emerging diseases . routine external quality assessment , along with well - characterised and up - to - date proficiency panels , would provide insight into mer ##s - co ##v diagnostic performance worldwide . a defined set of target product profiles for diagnostic technologies will be developed by who to address these gaps in mer ##s - co ##v outbreak management .  
known human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) usually cause mild to moderate upper - respiratory tract illnesses , except sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , which , in addition to mild illness can also be associated with severe respiratory diseases and high mortality rates . well - characterized multiple ##xed ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays are needed to aid in rapid detection and surveillance of hc ##ov ##s . the present study describes development and evaluation of a multiple ##xed magnetic micro ##sphere im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y ( mm ##ia ) to simultaneously detect im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) antibodies specific for rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins ( rec ##n ) from hc ##ov ##s 229 ##e , nl ##6 ##3 , o ##c ##43 , hk ##u ##1 , sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v . we used paired human sera to screen for i ##gg with react ##ivity against six hc ##ov ##s to determine ass ##ay sensitivity , specific ##ity and rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility . we found no signal interference between mono ##plex and multiple ##x ass ##ay formats ( r ( 2 ) range = 0 . 87 – 0 . 97 ) . screening of paired human sera using mm ##ia , resulted in 92 of 106 ( sensitivity : 86 % ) as positive and 68 of 80 ( specific ##ity : 84 % ) as negative . this study serves as a proof of concept that it is feasible to develop and use a multiple ##xed micro ##sphere im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y as a next generation screening tool for use in large scale ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce studies of hc ##ov ##s .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is endemic in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the arabian peninsula , and zoo ##not ##ic transmission to people is a sporadic event . in the absence of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data on the reservoir species , patterns of zoo ##not ##ic transmission have largely been approximate ##d from primary human cases . this study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary mer ##s infections in humans . methods : a case - crossover design was used to identify associations between primary mer ##s cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2 - week inc ##uba ##tion period in saudi arabia using un ##ivar ##iable conditional log ##istic regression . cases with sy ##mpt ##om onset between january 2015 – december 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human mer ##s cases maintained by the world health organization . the complete case data ##set ( n = 119 ##1 ) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spill ##over transmission from camel ##s ( n = 44 ##6 ) . data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean , minimum , and maximum temperature ( ( ο ) c ) , relative humidity ( % ) , wind speed ( m / s ) , and visibility ( m ) . weather variables were categorized according to strata ; temperature and humidity into ter ##tile ##s , and visibility and wind speed into halves . results : lowest temperature ( odds ratio = 1 . 27 ; 95 % confidence interval = 1 . 04 – 1 . 56 ) and humidity ( or = 1 . 35 ; 95 % ci = 1 . 10 – 1 . 65 ) were associated with increased cases 8 – 10 days later . high visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later ( or = 1 . 26 ; 95 % ci = 1 . 01 – 1 . 57 ) , while wind speed also showed statistical ##ly significant associations with cases 5 – 6 days later . conclusions : results suggest that primary mer ##s human cases in saudi arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry . this is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates . it was h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of mer ##s , however the opposite relationship was seen . this may reflect behaviour ##al changes in different weather conditions . this analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
background : the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections pose threats to public health worldwide , making an understanding of mer ##s pathogen ##esis and development of effective medical counter ##me ##as ##ures ( mc ##ms ) urgent . methods : we used homo ##zy ##go ##us ( + / + ) and het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us ( + / − ) human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) trans ##genic mice to study the effect of hd ##pp ##4 on mer ##s - co ##v infection . specifically , we determined values of 50 % lethal dose ( ld ( 50 ) ) of mer ##s - co ##v for the 2 strains of mice , compared and correlated their levels of soluble ( s ) hd ##pp ##4 expression to su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , and explored rec ##om ##bina ##nt ( r ) sh ##dp ##p ##4 as an effective mc ##m for mer ##s infection . results : hd ##pp ##4 ( + / + ) mice were unexpectedly more resistant than hd ##pp ##4 ( + / − ) mice to mer ##s - co ##v infection , as judged by increased ld ( 50 ) , reduced lung viral infection , at ##ten ##uated mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , and reduced his ##top ##ath ##ology . additionally , the resistance to mer ##s - co ##v infection directly correlated with increased serum sh ##dp ##p ##4 and serum virus neutral ##izing activity . finally , administration of rs ##hd ##pp ##4 led to reduced lung virus ti ##ter and his ##top ##ath ##ology . conclusions : our studies suggest that the serum sh ##dp ##p ##4 levels play a role in mer ##s pathogen ##esis and demonstrate a potential of rs ##hd ##pp ##4 as a treatment option for mer ##s . additionally , it offers a valid ##ated pair of t ##g mice strains for character ##izing the effect of sh ##dp ##p ##4 on mer ##s pathogen ##esis .  
in humans , infection with the corona ##virus , especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) and the emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , induce ##s acute respiratory failure , resulting in high mortality . irregular corona ##virus related epidemic ##s indicate that the evolutionary origins of these two pathogen ##s need to be identified urgently and there are still questions related to suitable laboratory animal models . thus , in this review we aim to highlight key discoveries concerning the animal origin of the virus and sum ##mar ##ize and compare current animal models .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in humans in 2012 . a systematic literature review was conducted to synth ##es ##ize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps . materials and methods : we conducted a systematic review on mer ##s - co ##v using prism ##a guidelines . we identified 407 relevant , peer - reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas : vi ##rol ##ogy ; clinical characteristics , outcomes , therapeutic and prevent ##ive options ; ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and transmission ; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of mer ##s - co ##v . results : dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 / cd ##26 ) was identified as the human receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , and a variety of molecular and ser ##ological ass ##ays developed . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s remain the only documented zoo ##not ##ic source of human infection , but mer ##s - like co ##vs have been detected in bat species globally , as well as in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s throughout the middle east and africa . however , despite evidence of camel - to - human mer ##s - co ##v transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact , the source of many primary cases remains unknown . there have been sustained health care - associated human outbreak ##s in saudi arabia and south korea , the latter originating from one traveler returning from the middle east . transmission mechanisms are poorly understood ; for health care , this may include environmental contamination . various potential therapeutic ##s have been identified , but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials . at least one candidate vaccine has progressed to phase i trials . conclusions : there has been substantial mer ##s - co ##v research since 2012 , but significant knowledge gaps persist , especially in ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and natural history of the infection . there have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence , transmission , and spectrum of disease . terms such as “ camel exposure ” and the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized . we strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database . corona ##virus ##es will likely continue to emerge , arguing for a unified “ one health ” approach .  
trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activate ##s the spike protein of highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es such as severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . in vitro , activation induce ##s virus - cell membrane fusion at the cell surface . however , the roles of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 during corona ##virus infection in vivo are unclear . here , we used animal models of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v infection to investigate the role of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . th ##1 - prone c ##57 ##bl / 6 mice and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - knockout ( ko ) mice were used for sar ##s - co ##v infection , and trans ##genic mice expressing the human mer ##s - co ##v receptor d ##pp ##4 ( hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g mice ) and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - ko hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g mice were used for mer ##s - co ##v infection . after experimental infection , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - def ##icient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetic ##s in the lungs . lack of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the air ##way , accompanied by less severe im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . however , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - ko mice showed weakened inflammatory che ##mo ##kin ##e and / or cy ##tok ##ine responses to intra ##nas ##al stimulation with poly ( i · c ) , a toll - like receptor 3 ago ##nist . in conclusion , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the air ##way of mu ##rine models infected by sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v and in the resulting im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . importance broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs against highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pan ##de ##mic threats . trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se ser ##ine type 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) , a pro ##tea ##se belonging to the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se family , cl ##ea ##ves the corona ##virus spike protein , making it a potential therapeutic target for corona ##virus infections . here , we examined the role of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 using animal models of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v infection . the results suggest that lack of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection can manifest as a mild illness , acute respiratory distress , organ failure , or death . several animal models have been established to study disease pathogen ##esis and to develop vaccines and therapeutic agents . here , we developed trans ##genic ( t ##g ) mice on a c ##57 ##bl / 6 background ; these mice expressed human cd ##26 / dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) , a functional receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , under the control of an end ##ogen ##ous hd ##pp ##4 promoter . we then characterized this mouse model of mer ##s - co ##v . the expression profile of hd ##pp ##4 in these mice was almost equivalent to that in human tissues , including kidney and lung ; however , hd ##pp ##4 was over ##ex ##pressed in mu ##rine cd ##3 - positive cells within peripheral blood and l ##ym ##ph ##oid tissues . intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation of young and adult t ##g mice with mer ##s - co ##v led to infection of the lower respiratory tract and path ##ological evidence of acute multi ##fo ##cal inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia within 7 days , with only transient loss of body weight . however , the im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in young and adult t ##g mice was different . on day 5 or 7 post ##ino ##cula ##tion , lungs of adult t ##g mice contained higher levels of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es associated with migration of macro ##pha ##ges . these results suggest that the im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v infection in the t ##g mouse is age dependent . the mouse model described here will increase our understanding of disease pathogen ##esis and host media ##tors that protect against mer ##s - co ##v infection . importance middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections are endemic in the middle east and a threat to public health worldwide . rodents are not susceptible to the virus because they do not express functional receptors ; therefore , we generated a new animal model of mer ##s - co ##v infection based on trans ##genic mice expressing human d ##pp ##4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) . the pattern of hd ##pp ##4 expression in this model was similar to that in human tissues ( except l ##ym ##ph ##oid tissue ) . in addition , mer ##s - co ##v was limited to the respiratory tract . here , we focused on host factors involved in im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in mer ##s - co ##v infection and clarified differences in anti ##vira ##l immune responses between young and adult trans ##genic mice . this new small - animal model could contribute to more in - depth
insect ##ivo ##rous bats are speculated to be ancestral hosts of middle - east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . mer ##s - co ##v causes disease in humans with thirty - five percent fatal ##ity , and has evolved proteins that counter ##act human anti ##vira ##l responses . since bats experimental ##ly infected with mer ##s - co ##v do not develop signs of disease , we tested the hypothesis that mer ##s - co ##v would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to sub ##vert anti ##vira ##l responses in bat cells . we infected human and bat ( ep ##tes ##icus fu ##scu ##s ) cells with mer ##s - co ##v and observed that the virus grew to higher ti ##ters in human cells . mer ##s - co ##v also effectively suppressed the anti ##vira ##l inter ##fer ##on beta ( if ##n ##β ) response in human cells , unlike in bat cells . to determine if ir ##f ##3 , a critical media ##tor of the inter ##fer ##on response , also regulated the response in bats , we examined the response of ir ##f ##3 to poly ( i : c ) , a synthetic analogue of viral double - stranded rna . we observed that bat ir ##f ##3 responded to poly ( i : c ) by nuclear trans ##lo ##cation and post - translation ##al modifications , hallmark ##s of ir ##f ##3 activation . suppression of ir ##f ##3 by small - interfering rna ( sir ##na ) demonstrated that ir ##f ##3 was critical for poly ( i : c ) and mer ##s - co ##v induced induction of if ##n ##β in bat cells . our study demonstrates that innate anti ##vira ##l signaling in e . fu ##scu ##s bat cells is resistant to mer ##s - co ##v - mediated sub ##version .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , an infectious corona ##virus first reported in 2012 , has a mortality rate greater than 35 % . therapeutic antibodies are key tools for preventing and treating mer ##s - co ##v infection , but to date no such agents have been approved for treatment of this virus . nano ##bo ##dies ( n ##bs ) are camel ##id heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments . we generated two ol ##igo ##meric n ##bs by linking two or three mono ##meric n ##bs ( mono - n ##bs ) targeting the mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , and compared their rb ##d - binding affinity , rb ##d – receptor binding inhibition , stability , and neutral ##izing and cross - neutral ##izing activity against mer ##s - co ##v . relative to mono - n ##b , dime ##ric n ##b ( di - n ##b ) and trim ##eric n ##b ( tri - n ##b ) had significantly greater ability to bind mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d proteins with or without mutations in the rb ##d , thereby potent ##ly blocking rb ##d – mer ##s - co ##v receptor binding . the engineered ol ##igo ##meric n ##bs were very stable under extreme conditions , including low or high ph , pro ##tea ##se ( pepsi ##n ) , chao ##tro ##pic den ##at ##ura ##nt ( ur ##ea ) , and high temperature . importantly , di - n ##b and tri - n ##b ex ##erted significantly elevated broad - spectrum neutral ##izing activity against at least 19 human and camel mer ##s - co ##v strains isolated in different countries and years . overall , the engineered n ##bs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) shed ##ding and antibody responses are not fully understood , particularly in relation to underlying medical conditions , clinical manifestation ##s , and mortality . we enrolled mer ##s - co ##v – positive patients at a hospital in saudi arabia and periodically collected specimens from multiple sites for real - time reverse transcription pc ##r and ser ##olo ##gic testing . we conducted interviews and chart abstraction ##s to collect clinical , ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic , and laboratory information . we found that diabetes mel ##lit ##us among survivors was associated with prolonged mer ##s - co ##v rna detection in the respiratory tract . among case - patients who died , development of robust neutral ##izing serum antibody responses during the second and third week of illness was not sufficient for patient recovery or virus clearance . fever and cough among mildly ill patients typically aligned with rna detection in the upper respiratory tract ; rna levels peaked during the first week of illness . these findings should be considered in the development of infection control policies , vaccines , and antibody therapeutic ##s .  
background : human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) usually cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses . the novel corona ##virus ( nc ##ov ) , or middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , is a particular strain different from any other known hc ##ov with the possibility of human and also zoo ##not ##ic transmissions . the aim of the study to assess primary health care ( ph ##c ) physicians ’ knowledge and adherence regarding saudi ministry of health guidelines regarding mer ##s - co ##v . materials and methods : a cross - sectional study design was followed to include 85 ph ##c physicians in ab ##ha city . an interview question ##naire has been designed by the researcher that was used to assess knowledge and practices of ph ##c physicians regarding diagnosis and management of mer ##s - co ##v . it includes personal characteristics , the mer ##s - co ##v knowledge assessment question ##naire , and practices related to adherence toward guidelines regarding mer ##s - co ##v . results : ph ##c physicians ’ knowledge gaps regarding mer ##s - co ##v included protected exposure ( 32 . 9 % ) , highest seasonal incidence of mer ##s - co ##v in saudi arabia ( 60 % ) , relation between incidence of mer ##s - co ##v and over ##crow ##ding ( 62 . 4 % ) , case fatal ##ity of mer ##s - co ##v cases ( 63 . 5 % ) , and collecting specimens from mer ##s - co ##v patients ( 64 . 7 % ) . the knowledge of ph ##c physicians about mer ##s - co ##v was poor among 5 . 9 % , good among 63 . 5 % , and excellent among 30 . 6 % . personal protective equipment to be used when seeing suspected cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection were mainly the mask ( 94 . 1 % ) , gloves ( 78 . 8 % ) , the gown ( 60 % ) , go ##ggles ( 31 . 8 % ) , and the cap ( 22 . 4 % ) . all participants stated that the most important standard pre ##ca ##ution that should be applied when seeing a case of mer ##s - co ##v infection is hand washing , whereas 97 . 6 % stated that the most important respiratory pre ##ca ##ution to prevent transmission of respiratory infections in ph ##c setting when seeing a case of mer ##s - co ##v infection is mask ##ing and separation of suspected mer ##s - co ##v patients , and 81 . 2 % stated that upon exit from the room of a mer ##s - co ##v patient , the physician should remove and disc ##ard personal protective equipment . ph ##c physicians ’ knowledge about mer ##s - co ##v differed significantly according to their nationality ( p = 0 . 03
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in 2012 as a novel et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe respiratory disease in humans . as during infection by other viruses , host sensing of viral double - stranded rna ( ds ##rna ) induce ##s several anti ##vira ##l pathways . these include inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late synth ##eta ##se ( o ##as ) - rna ##se l , and protein kinase r ( p ##kr ) . corona ##virus ##es , including mer ##s - co ##v , potent ##ly suppress the activation of these pathways , inducing only modest host responses . our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to mer ##s - co ##v and related viruses , ns ##4 ##a and ns ##4 ##b , during infection in human air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um - derived a ##54 ##9 cells . ns ##4 ##a has been previously characterized as a ds ##rna binding protein , while ns ##4 ##b is a 2 ′ , 5 ′ - ph ##os ##ph ##odies ##tera ##se with structural and en ##zy ##matic similarity to ns ##2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) . we found that del ##eti ##on of ns ##4 ##a results in increased inter ##fer ##on lambda ( if ##nl ##1 ) expression , as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear local ##ization sequence of ns ##4 ##b . all of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication . we previously reported that , like m ##h ##v ns ##2 , ns ##4 ##b ant ##ago ##ni ##zes o ##as - rna ##se l , but suppression of if ##n is a previously unidentified function for viral ph ##os ##ph ##odies ##tera ##ses . unexpectedly , del ##eti ##on of ns ##4 ##a does not result in robust activation of the p ##kr or o ##as - rna ##se l pathways . therefore , mer ##s - co ##v likely en ##codes other proteins that contribute to suppression or eva ##sion of these anti ##vira ##l innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work . this study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between mer ##s - co ##v and the host immune response .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging zoo ##not ##ic virus considered as one of the major public threat with a total number of 2 298 laboratory - confirmed cases and 81 ##1 associated deaths reported by world health organization as of january 2019 . the transmission of the virus was expected to be from the camel ##s found in middle eastern countries via the animal and human interaction . the genome structure provided information about the pathogen ##ici ##ty and associated vi ##ru ##lent factors present in the virus . recent studies suggested that there were limited insight available on the development of novel therapeutic strategies to induce immunity against the virus . the se ##ver ##ities of mer ##s - co ##v infection highlight the necessity of effective approaches for the development of various therapeutic re ##med ##ies . thus , the present review comprehensive ##ly and critically illustrates the recent aspects on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the virus , the structural and functional features of the viral genome , viral entry and transmission , major mechanisms of pathogen ##esis and associated vi ##ru ##lent factors , current animal models , detection methods and novel strategies for the development of vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v . the review further illustrates the molecular and computational virtual screening platforms which provide insights for the identification of put ##ative drug targets and novel lead molecules toward the development of therapeutic re ##med ##ies .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are natural host of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . however , there are limited studies of mer ##s - co ##v infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . we expanded our surveillance among camel ##s in egypt , tunisia , and senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camel ##s . a total of 820 sera and 82 ##3 nasal sw ##ab ##s from cattle , sheep , goats , donkey ##s , buffalo ##es , mule ##s , and horses were collected . sw ##ab ##s were tested using rt - pc ##r and virus rna - positive samples were genetically sequence ##d and phylogenetic ##ally anal ##yse ##d . sera were screened using virus micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization tests and positive sera ( where available ) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutral ##ization tests ( pr ##nt ) . we detected 90 % pr ##nt confirmed mer ##s - co ##v antibody in 35 ( 55 . 6 % ) of 63 sera from sheep collected from senegal , two sheep ( 1 . 8 % ) of 114 in tunisia and a goat ( 0 . 9 % ) of 107 in egypt , with ti ##tres ranging from 1 : 80 to ≥ ##1 : 320 . we detected mer ##s - co ##v rna in sw ##ab ##s from three sheep ( 1 . 2 % ) of 254 and five goats ( 4 . 1 % ) of 121 from egypt and senegal , as well as one cow ( 1 . 9 % ) of 53 and three donkey ##s ( 7 . 1 % ) of 42 from egypt . partial sequences of the rt - pc ##r amp ##lic ##ons confirmed specific ##ity of the results . this study showed that domestic livestock in contact with mer ##s - co ##v infected camel ##s may be at risk of infection . we recommend expanding current mer ##s - co ##v surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . the segregation of camel ##s from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered .  
the middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic virus that causes severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans . efforts to develop antibody - based the ##ra ##pies have focused on neutral ##izing antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein thereby blocking receptor binding . here , we developed a set of human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that target functional ##ly distinct domains of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . these antibodies belong to six distinct ep ##ito ##pe groups and interfere with the three critical entry functions of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein : si ##alic acid binding , receptor binding and membrane fusion . passive im ##mun ##ization with potent ##ly as well as with poorly neutral ##izing antibodies protected mice from lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge . collectively , these antibodies offer new ways to gain humor ##al protection in humans against the emerging mer ##s - co ##v by targeting different spike protein ep ##ito ##pes and functions .  
continuously emerging highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) remain a major threat to human health , as illustrated in past sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v outbreak ##s . the development of a drug with broad - spectrum hc ##ov inhibitor ##y activity would address this urgent un ##met medical need . although previous studies have suggested that the hr ##1 of hc ##ov spike ( s ) protein is an important target site for inhibition against specific hc ##ov ##s , whether this conserved region could serve as a target for the development of broad - spectrum pan - co ##v inhibitor remains controversial . here , we found that peptide o ##c ##43 - hr ##2 ##p , derived from the hr ##2 domain of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , exhibited broad fusion inhibitor ##y activity against multiple hc ##ov ##s . ek ##1 , the opt ##imi ##zed form of o ##c ##43 - hr ##2 ##p , showed substantially improved pan - co ##v fusion inhibitor ##y activity and pharmaceutical properties . crystal structures indicated that ek ##1 can form a stable six - helix bundle structure with both short α - hc ##ov and long β - hc ##ov hr ##1 ##s , further supporting the role of hr ##1 region as a viable pan - co ##v target site .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic pathogen that causes respiratory infection in humans , ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to severe pneumonia . in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals . differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals , as well as between humans and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , highlight the role of host factors in mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and transmission . one of these host factors , the mer ##s - co ##v receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , may be a critical deter ##mina ##nt because it is var ##ia ##bly expressed in mer ##s - co ##v - susceptible species as well as in humans . this could partially explain inter - and intra ##sp ##ec ##ies differences in the tr ##op ##ism , pathogen ##esis , and trans ##mis ##sibility of mer ##s - co ##v . in this review , we explore the role of d ##pp ##4 and other host factors in mer ##s - co ##v transmission and pathogen ##esis — such as si ##alic acids , host pro ##tea ##ses , and inter ##fer ##ons . further characterization of these host deter ##mina ##nts may potentially offer novel insights to develop intervention strategies to tackle ongoing outbreak ##s .  
mer ##s - co ##v is present in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s throughout the middle east and africa . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the primary zoo ##not ##ic reservoir for human infections . interruption of the zoo ##not ##ic transmission chain from camel ##s to humans , therefore , may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . here we show that va ##cci ##nation with an ad ##ju ##vant ##ed mer ##s - co ##v spike protein subunit vaccine con ##fers complete protection from mer ##s - co ##v disease in al ##pac ##a and results in reduced and delayed viral shed ##ding in the upper airways of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . protection in al ##pac ##a co ##rre ##lates with high serum neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters . lower ti ##ters of serum neutral ##izing antibodies co ##rre ##late with delayed and significantly reduced shed ##ding in the nasal tu ##rbin ##ates of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . together , these data indicate that induction of robust neutral ##izing humor ##al immune responses by va ##cci ##nation of naive animals reduces shed ##ding that potentially could dim ##ini ##sh the risk of zoo ##not ##ic transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) first emerged in late 2012 . since its emergence , a total of 227 ##9 patients from 27 countries have been infected across the globe according to a world health organization ( who ) report ( feb . 12th , 2019 ) . approximately 80 ##6 patients have died . the virus uses its spike proteins as ad ##hesive factors that are pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory for host entry through a specific receptor called dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . this receptor is considered a key factor in the signaling and activation of the acquired and innate immune responses in infected patients . using potent antigen ##s in combination with strong ad ##ju ##vant ##s may effectively trigger the activation of specific mer ##s - co ##v cellular responses as well as the production of neutral ##izing antibodies . unfortunately , to date , there is no effective approved treatment or vaccine for mer ##s - co ##v . thus , there are urgent needs for the development of novel mer ##s - co ##v the ##ra ##pies as well as vaccines to help minimize the spread of the virus from infected patients , thereby mit ##iga ##ting the risk of any potential pan ##de ##mics . our main goals are to highlight and describe the current knowledge of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to mer ##s - co ##v and the current state of mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development . we believe this study will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that enhance the mer ##s - co ##v immune response and subsequently contribute to the control of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
we evaluated genetic variation in middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) imported to south korea in 2018 using specimens from a patient and isolate ##s from infected ca ##co - 2 cells . the mer ##s - co ##v strain in this study was genetically similar to a strain isolated in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , in 2017 .  
camel contact is a recognized risk factor for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . because specific camel exposure ##s associated with mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity are not fully understood , we investigated worker – camel interactions and mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce . we assessed worker ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce in 2 slaughter ##houses and 1 live - animal market in abu dhabi , united arab emirates , during 2014 – 2017 and administered an ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic survey in 2016 and 2017 . across 3 sampling rounds during 2014 – 2017 , we sampled 100 – 235 workers , and 6 % – 19 % were ser ##op ##osi ##tive for mer ##s - co ##v at each sampling round . one ( 1 . 4 % ) of 70 ser ##one ##gative workers tested at multiple rounds ser ##oco ##n ##verted . on multi ##var ##iable analyses , working as a camel salesman , handling live camel ##s or their waste , and having diabetes were associated with ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity among all workers , whereas handling live camel ##s and either administering medications or cleaning equipment was associated with ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity among market workers . characterization of high - risk exposure ##s is critical for implementation of prevent ##ive measures .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is considered to be responsible for a new viral epidemic and an emerge ##nt threat to global health security . this study describes the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ological status of mer ##s - co ##v in the world . methods : ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analysis was performed on data derived from all mer ##s - co ##v cases recorded in the disease outbreak news on who website between 1 . 1 . 2017 and 17 . 1 . 2018 . demographic and clinical information as well as potential contacts and probable risk factors for mortality were extracted based on laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases . results : a total of 229 mer ##s - co ##v cases , including 70 deaths ( 30 . 5 % ) , were recorded in the disease outbreak news on world health organization website over the study period . based on available details in this study , the case fatal ##ity rate in both gender ##s was 30 . 5 % ( 70 / 229 ) [ 32 . 1 % ( 55 / 171 ) for males and 25 . 8 % ( 15 / 58 ) for females ] . the disease occurrence was higher among men [ 171 cases ( 74 . 7 % ) ] than women [ 58 cases ( 25 . 3 % ) ] . variables such as como ##rb ##idi ##ties and exposure to mer ##s - co ##v cases were significantly associated with mortality in people affected with mer ##s - co ##v infections , and adjusted odds ratio estimates were 2 . 2 ( 95 % ci : 1 . 16 , 7 . 03 ) and 2 . 3 ( 95 % ci : 1 . 35 , 8 . 20 ) , respectively . all age groups had an equal chance of mortality . conclusions : in today ’ s “ global village ” , there is probability of mer ##s - co ##v epidemic at any time and in any place without prior notice . thus , health systems in all countries should implement better tri ##age systems for potentially imported cases of mer ##s - co ##v to prevent large epidemic ##s .  
since its emergence in 2012 , 2 , 260 cases and 80 ##3 deaths due to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have been reported to the world health organization . most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings , sometimes causing large outbreak ##s . we analyzed ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic and clinical data of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases from eleven healthcare - associated outbreak ##s in the kingdom of saudi arabia and the republic of korea between 2015 – 2017 . we quan ##ti ##fied key ep ##ide ##mi ##ological differences between outbreak ##s . twenty - five percent ( n = 105 / 422 ) of mer ##s cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel . in multi ##var ##iate analyses , age ≥ ##65 ( or 4 . 8 , 95 % ci : 2 . 6 – 8 . 7 ) and the presence of underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ties ( or : 2 . 7 , 95 % ci : 1 . 3 – 5 . 7 ) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective ( or 0 . 07 , 95 % ci : 0 . 01 – 0 . 34 ) . at the start of these outbreak ##s , the reproduction number ranged from 1 . 0 to 5 . 7 ; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks . this study provides a comprehensive characterization of mer ##s hc ##a - outbreak ##s . our results highlight het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##ies in the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological profile of healthcare - associated outbreak ##s . the limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high - threat respiratory pathogen ##s , such as mer ##s - co ##v .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a life - threatening respiratory disease with a high case fatal ##ity rate ; however , its risk factors remain unclear . we aimed to explore the influence of demographic factors , clinical manifestation ##s and underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ties on mortality in mer ##s - co ##v patients . retrospective chart reviews were performed to identify all laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection in saudi arabia that were reported to the ministry of health of saudi arabia between 23 april 2014 and 7 june 2016 . statistical analyses were conducted to assess the effect of sex , age , clinical presentation and como ##rb ##idi ##ties on mortality from mer ##s - co ##v . a total of 281 confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases were identified : 167 ( 59 . 4 % ) patients were male and 55 ( 20 % ) died . mortality predominantly occurred among saudi nationals and older patients and was significantly associated with respiratory failure and short ##ness of breath . of the 281 confirmed cases , 160 ( 56 . 9 % ) involved como ##rb ##idi ##ties , wherein diabetes mel ##lit ##us , hyper ##tension , is ##che ##mic heart disease , cong ##est ##ive heart failure , end - stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with mortality from mer ##s - co ##v and two or three como ##rb ##idi ##ties significantly affected the fatal ##ity rates from mer ##s - co ##v . the findings of this study show that old age and the existence of underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ties significantly increase mortality from mer ##s - co ##v .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been shown to be the main reservoir for human middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) infections . this systematic review aims to com ##pile and anal ##yse all published data on mer ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) in the global camel population to provide an overview of current knowledge on the distribution , spread and risk factors of infections in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . we included original research articles containing laboratory evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infections in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the field from 2013 to april 2018 . in general , camel ##s only show minor clinical signs of disease after being infected with mer ##s - co ##v . ser ##ological evidence of mer ##s - co ##v in camel ##s has been found in 20 countries , with molecular evidence for virus circulation in 13 countries . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies increases with age in camel ##s , while the prevalence of viral shed ##ding as determined by mer ##s - co ##v rna detection in nasal sw ##ab ##s decreases . in several studies , camel ##s that were sampled at animal markets or qu ##aran ##tine facilities were ser ##op ##osi ##tive more often than camel ##s at farms as well as imported camel ##s vs . locally bred camel ##s . some studies show a relatively higher ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce and viral detection during the cooler winter months . knowledge of the animal reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v is essential to develop intervention and control measures to prevent human infections .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) transmission from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies to humans has resulted in major outbreak ##s in the middle east . although some other livestock animal species have been shown to be susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v , it is not fully understood why the spread of the virus in these animal species has not been observed in the field . in this study , we used rabbits to further character ##ize the transmission potential of mer ##s - co ##v . in line with the presence of mer ##s - co ##v receptor in the rabbit nasal ep ##ith ##eli ##um , high levels of viral rna were shed from the nose following virus in ##oc ##ulation . however , unlike mer ##s - co ##v - infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestation ##s including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose . consistently , no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits . our data indicate that despite relatively high viral rna levels produced , low levels of infectious virus are ex ##cre ##ted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission .  
in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged . to date , more than 230 ##0 cases have been reported , with an approximate case fatal ##ity rate of 35 % . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations identified dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s as the source of mer ##s - co ##v zoo ##not ##ic transmission and evidence of mer ##s - co ##v circulation has been observed throughout the original range of distribution . other new - world camel ##ids , al ##pac ##as and ll ##ama ##s , are also susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v infection . currently , it is unknown whether ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s are susceptible to infection . the distribution of ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s overlap ##s partly with that of the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel in west and central asia . the receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , d ##pp ##4 , of the ba ##ct ##rian camel was 98 . 3 % identical to the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel d ##pp ##4 , and 100 % identical for the 14 residues which interact with the mer ##s - co ##v spike receptor . upon intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation with 107 plaque - forming units of mer ##s - co ##v , animals developed a transient , primarily upper respiratory tract infection . clinical signs of the mer ##s - co ##v infection were benign , but shed ##ding of large quantities of mer ##s - co ##v from the ur ##t was observed . these data are similar to infections reported with dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel infections and indicate that ba ##ct ##rians are susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v and given their overlapping range are at risk of introduction and establishment of mer ##s - co ##v within the ba ##ct ##rian camel populations .  
the recently identified middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in humans . however , no approved prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic interventions are currently available . the mer ##s - co ##v envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutral ##izing antibodies and vaccine development , as it plays a critical role in media ##ting viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . here , we constructed a rec ##om ##bina ##nt rare ser ##otype of the chi ##mp ##an ##zee aden ##ov ##irus 68 ( ad ##c ##6 ##8 ) that expresses full - length mer ##s - co ##v s protein ( ad ##c ##6 ##8 - s ) . single intra ##nas ##al im ##mun ##ization with ad ##c ##6 ##8 - s induced robust and sustained neutral ##izing antibody and t cell responses in bal ##b / c mice . in a human d ##pp ##4 knock - in ( hd ##pp ##4 - ki ) mouse model , it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v - ma ) . passive transfer of immune sera to naive hd ##pp ##4 - ki mice also provided survival advantages from lethal mer ##s - co ##v - ma challenge . analysis of sera absorption and isolated mono ##cl ##onal antibodies from im ##mun ##ized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutral ##izing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the s protein . these results show that ad ##c ##6 ##8 - s can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against mer ##s - co ##v infection in both dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and humans .  
introduction : data are lacking on impact of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) on health - related quality of life ( hr ##q ##ol ) among survivors . methods : we conducted a cross - sectional survey of mer ##s survivors who required hospital ##ization in saudi arabia during 2016 – 2017 , approximately 1 year after diagnosis . the short - form general health survey 36 ( sf - 36 ) was administered by telephone interview to assess 8 quality of life domains for mer ##s survivors and a sample of survivors of severe acute respiratory infection ( sar ##i ) without mer ##s . we compared mean sf - 36 scores of mer ##s and non - mer ##s sar ##i survivors using independent t - test , and compared cat ##egorical variables using chi - square test . adjusted analyses were performed using multiple linear regression . results : of 355 mer ##s survivors , 83 were eligible and 78 agreed to participate . mer ##s survivors were younger than non - mer ##s sar ##i survivors ( mean ± sd ) : ( 44 . 9 years ± ##12 . 9 ) vs ( 50 . 0 years ± ##13 . 6 ) , p = 0 . 03 ##1 . intensive care unit ( ic ##u ) admissions were similar for mer ##s and non - mer ##s sar ##i survivors ( 46 . 2 % vs . 57 . 1 % ) , p = 0 . 20 . after adjusting for potential con ##fo ##under ##s , there were no significant differences between mer ##s and non - mer ##s sar ##i survivors in physical component or mental component summary scores . mer ##s ic ##u survivors scored lower than mer ##s survivors not admitted to an ic ##u for physical function ( p = 0 . 05 ) , general health ( p = 0 . 01 ) , vital ##ity ( p = 0 . 03 ) , emotional role ( p = 0 . 03 ) and physical component summary ( p < 0 . 02 ) . conclusions : functional scores were similar for mer ##s and non - mer ##s sar ##i survivors . however , mer ##s survivors of critical illness reported lower quality of life than survivors of less severe illness . efforts are needed to address the long - term medical and psychological needs of mer ##s survivors .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has spread through 27 countries and infected more than 2 , 200 people since its first outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 . the high fatal ##ity rate ( 35 . 4 % ) of this novel corona ##virus and its persistent wide spread infectious ##ness in animal reservoirs have generated tremendous global public health concern . however , no licensed therapeutic agents or vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v are currently available and only a limited few have entered clinical trials . among all the potential targets of mer ##s - co ##v , the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) has been the most well - studied due to its critical role in media ##ting viral entry and in inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals . the most notable studies include the recent discoveries of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and development of candidate vaccines against the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . structural characterization of mer ##s - co ##v s protein bound with these mono ##cl ##onal antibodies has provided insights into the mechanisms of humor ##al immune responses against mer ##s - co ##v infection . the current review aims to highlight these developments and discuss possible hurdles and strategies to translate these discoveries into ultimate medical interventions against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . mer ##s has been endemic to saudi arabia since 2012 . the reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v is the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel , suggesting that mer ##s is primarily a zoo ##not ##ic disease . mer ##s - co ##v is common in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies throughout the middle east , north africa , and east africa as evidenced by neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v ; however , human cases have remained limited to the middle east . to better understand the cause of this difference , the vi ##rol ##ogical properties of african camel mer ##s - co ##v were analyzed based on the spike ( s ) protein in ethiopia . nasal sw ##ab ##s were collected from 258 young dr ##ome ##dar ##ies ( ≤ 2 years old ) in the afar region of ethiopia , of which 39 were positive for mer ##s - co ##v , as confirmed by genetic tests . all positive tests were exclusive to the ami ##bara wore ##da region . using next - generation sequencing , two full - length genome ##s of ami ##bara isolate ##s were successfully deco ##ded ; both isolate ##s belonged to the c2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full - length and s protein sequences . rec ##om ##bina ##nt em ##c isolate ##s of mer ##s - co ##v , in which the s protein is replaced with those of ami ##bara isolate ##s , were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties . ami ##bara s rec ##om ##bina ##nts replicate ##d more slowly in culture ##d cells than in em ##c s rec ##om ##bina ##nts . in neutral ##izing ass ##ays , ami ##bara s rec ##om ##bina ##nts were neutral ##ized by lower concentrations of sera from both ethiopian dr ##ome ##dar ##ies and em ##c isolate ( wild - type ) - im ##mun ##ized mouse sera , relative to the em ##c s rec ##om ##bina ##nts , indicating that viruses coated in the ami ##bara s protein were easier to neutral ##ize than the em ##c s protein . neutral ##ization experiments performed using s ##1 / s ##2 chi ##meric rec ##om ##bina ##nts of the em ##c and ami ##bara s proteins showed that the neutral ##ization profile was dependent on the s ##1 region of the s protein . these results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutral ##ization seen in the ethiopian mer ##s - co ##v are due to strain - specific differences in the s protein and may account for the absence of human mer ##s - co ##v cases in ethiopia .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) uses the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to recognize and enter target cells . in this study , we selected two ep ##ito ##pe peptide sequences within the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v s protein . we used a complex consisting of the ep ##ito ##pe peptide of the mer ##s - co ##v s protein and cp ##g - dna en ##cap ##sul ##ated in lip ##oso ##me complex to im ##mun ##ize mice , and produced the mono ##cl ##onal antibodies 50 ##6 - 2 ##g ##10 ##g ##5 and 49 ##2 - 1 ##g ##10 ##e ##4 ##e ##2 . the western b ##lot ##ting data showed that both mono ##cl ##onal antibodies detected the s protein and im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ated the native form of the s protein . indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and con ##fo ##cal analysis suggested strong react ##ivity of the antibodies towards the s protein of mer ##s - co ##v virus infected ve ##ro cells . furthermore , the 50 ##6 - 2 ##g ##10 ##g ##5 mono ##cl ##onal antibody significantly reduced plaque formation in mer ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro cells compared to normal mouse i ##gg and 49 ##2 - 1 ##g ##10 ##e ##4 ##e ##2 . thus , we successfully produced a mono ##cl ##onal antibody directed against the rb ##d domain of the s protein which could be used in the development of diagnostic ##s and therapeutic applications in the future .  
background : after the emergence of new influenza viruses , the mor ##bid ##ity and mortality of viral pneumonia have received a great attention . objectives : the objective of this study is to describe the ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic , clinical and laboratory changes , and outcomes of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections . methods : in a retrospective co ##hort study , the medical records of all patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia at prince sultan military medical city , ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , during the period from january 2012 to december 2015 were screened . cases who were > 18 years old and were confirmed by a respiratory viral panel to have viral pneumonia either mer ##s - co ##v or influenza viruses were included in the analysis . socio ##de ##mo ##graphic , clinical , laboratory , and outcome data were extracted from patients ' medical files . the data were analyzed descriptive ##ly and in ##fer ##ential ##ly to identify the predict ##ors of poor outcome . results : a total of 44 ##8 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia were included , of those , 216 ( 48 . 2 % ) were caused by influenza a ( non h ##1 ##n ##1 ) / influenza b , 150 ( 33 . 5 % ) by h ##1 ##n ##1 , and 82 ( 18 . 3 % ) by mer ##s - co ##v . the majority of patients presented with fever ( 82 % ) , short ##ness of breath ( 64 % ) , and flu - like symptoms ( 54 . 9 % ) , particularly in mer ##s - co ##v infected cases ( 92 % ) . the peak incidence of viral pneumonia was in early spring and autumn . the mortality rate was 13 . 8 % , and it was significantly higher among mer ##s - co ##v cases . the predict ##ors of death were age > 65 years , male gender , and associated como ##rb ##idi ##ties particularly diabetes mel ##lit ##us , hyper ##tension , and chronic kidney diseases . the number of como ##rb ##id illnesses was directly related to the increase in mortality in this group of patients . conclusion : viral pneumonia caused by influenza and mer ##s - co ##v carries a high mortality rate , particularly among mer ##s - co ##v infected cases . old age , male gender , and como ##rb ##id illnesses are predict ##ors of poor outcome . routine testing for newly emerge ##nt viruses is warrant ##ed for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) act as cross - species viruses and have the potential to spread rapidly into new host species and cause epidemic diseases . despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , there are currently no drugs available for their treatment ; therefore , broad - spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic co ##vs are urgently needed . to search for effective inhibitor ##y agents , we performed high - through ##put screening ( h ##ts ) of a 2 , 000 - compound library of approved drugs and ph ##arm ##aco ##logical ##ly active compounds using the established genetically engineered human co ##v o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) strain expressing ren ##illa lucifer ##ase ( roc ##43 - ns ##2 ##del - r ##lu ##c ) and valid ##ated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct co ##vs in vitro . we screened 56 hits from the h ##ts data and valid ##ated 36 compounds in vitro using wild - type hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 . furthermore , we identified seven compounds ( l ##y ##cor ##ine , em ##eti ##ne , mon ##ens ##in sodium , my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late mo ##fe ##ti ##l , my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid , ph ##ena ##zo ##py ##rid ##ine , and p ##yr ##vin ##ium pam ##oat ##e ) as broad - spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four co ##vs in vitro at low - micro ##mo ##lar concentrations . additionally , we found that em ##eti ##ne blocked mer ##s - co ##v entry according to pseudo ##virus entry ass ##ays and that l ##y ##cor ##ine protected bal ##b / c mice against hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 - induced lethal ##ity by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system . this represents the first demonstration of in vivo real - time bio ##lum ##ines ##cence imaging to monitor the effect of l ##y ##cor ##ine on the spread and distribution of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 in a mouse model . these results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against co ##v infection . importance currently , there is no approved therapy to treat corona ##virus infection ; therefore , broad - spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic co ##vs are needed . based on our high - through ##put screening ass ##ay using a compound library , we identified seven compounds with broad - spectrum efficacy against the replication of four co ##vs in vitro . additionally , one compound ( l ##y ##cor ##ine ) was found to protect bal ##b / c mice against hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 - induced lethal ##ity by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system . this inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combat ##ting novel co ##v infections
va ##cci ##nation is the most functional medical intervention to prop ##hyl ##actic ##ally control severe diseases caused by human - to - human or animal - to - human trans ##missible viral pathogen ##s . annually , seasonal influenza epidemic ##s attack human populations leading to 290 – 650 thousand deaths / year worldwide . recently , a novel middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus emerged . together , those two viruses present a significant public health burden in areas where they ci ##rc ##ulate . here ##in , we generated a bacterial outer membrane ve ##sic ##les ( om ##vs ) - based vaccine presenting the antigen ##ic stable chi ##meric fusion protein of the h ##1 - type ha ##ema ##gg ##lu ##tin ##in ( ha ) of the pan ##de ##mic influenza a virus ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ) strain from 2009 ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 ) and the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ( om ##vs - h ##1 / rb ##d ) . our results showed that the chi ##meric antigen could induce specific neutral ##izing antibodies against both strains leading to protection of im ##mun ##ized mice against h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 and efficient neutral ##ization of mer ##s - co ##v . this study demonstrate that om ##vs - based vaccines presenting viral antigen ##s provide a safe and reliable approach to protect against two different viral infections .  
there is no effective therapeutic or vaccine for middle east respiratory syndrome and this study attempts to find therapy using peptide by establishing a basis for the peptide - protein interactions through in si ##lic ##o docking studies for the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v . the anti ##mic ##ro ##bial peptide ##s ( amp ##s ) were retrieved from the anti ##mic ##ro ##bial peptide database ( ap ##d ##3 ) and shortlisted based on certain important ph ##ys ##ico ##chemical properties . the binding mode of the shortlisted peptide ##s was measured based on the number of clusters which forms in a protein - peptide docking using piper . as a result , we identified a list of put ##ative amp ##s which binds to the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v , which may be crucial in providing the inhibitor ##y action . it is observed that seven put ##ative peptide ##s have good binding score based on cluster size cut ##off of 208 . we conclude that seven peptide ##s , namely , ap ##00 ##22 ##5 , ap ##00 ##18 ##0 , ap ##00 ##54 ##9 , ap ##00 ##7 ##44 , ap ##00 ##7 ##29 , ap ##00 ##7 ##64 , and ap ##00 ##22 ##3 , could possibly have binding with the active site of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . these seven amp ##s could serve as a therapeutic option for mer ##s and enhance its treatment outcome .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes an acute and severe lower respiratory illness as well as vomiting , dia ##rr ##hea , and renal failure . because no licensed mer ##s - co ##v vaccines are currently available , prevent ##ive and therapeutic measures are urgently needed . the surface spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of mer ##s - co ##v , which binds to the cellular receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , is considered as a major target for mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development . here , we designed rec ##om ##bina ##nt replication - def ##icient aden ##ov ##irus - based vaccines expressing the n - terminal domain ( ra ##d / nt ##d ) and receptor - binding domain ( ra ##d / rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 subunit and full - length spike protein ( ra ##d / spike ) . we found that im ##mun ##ization with candidate vaccines via intra ##nas ##al route induced s ##1 - specific i ##gg antibodies and neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s spike pseudo ##type ##d virus . especially , ra ##d / spike induced the highest neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter and the strongest cy ##tok ##ine - induced t cell responses among the three candidate vaccines . to compare the immune responses induced by different administration routes , ra ##d / spike was administered via intra ##nas ##al , sub ##ling ##ual , or intra ##mus ##cular route . all these administration routes exhibited neutral ##izing effects in the serum . mer ##s - co ##v - specific neutral ##izing i ##ga antibodies in the bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid were only induced by intra ##nas ##al and sub ##ling ##ual administration but not by intra ##mus ##cular administration . intra ##nas ##al administration with ra ##d / spike also created resident memory cd ##8 t cells in the air ##way and lung par ##en ##chy ##ma . taken together , our results showed that both the humor ##al and cellular immune responses are highly induced by ra ##d / spike administration , suggesting that ra ##d / spike may con ##fer protection against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
newly emerging viral pathogen ##s pose a constant and unpredictable threat to human and animal health . corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have a pen ##chan ##t for sudden emergence , as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and most recently , sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) . small animal models of emerging viral pathogen ##esis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression . however , rode ##nt models are often criticized for their limited trans ##lat ##ability to humans . the complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the united states serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis . we recently generated a mouse model for mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis through the human ##ization of the or ##th ##olo ##go ##us entry receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . to increase the trans ##lat ##ability of this model , we valid ##ated and established the use of an automated veterinary hem ##ato ##logy analyze ##r ( vet ##scan hm ##5 ) at bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood . mer ##s - co ##v lung ti ##ter peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia in peripheral blood , two phenomena also observed in mer ##s - co ##v infection of humans . the fluctuations in le ##uk ##oc ##yte populations measured by vet ##scan hm ##5 were co ##rro ##bor ##ated by standard flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry , thus confirming the utility of this approach . comparing a sub ##let ##hal and lethal dose of mer ##s - co ##v in mice , analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of le ##uk ##ocytes . major le ##uk ##oc ##yte populations were mod ##ulated before weight loss was observed . importantly , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil counts on 1 ##dp ##i were predict ##ive of disease severity with a lethal dose of mer ##s - co ##v highlighting the predict ##ive value of hem ##ato ##logy in this model . taken together , the inclusion of hem ##ato ##logical measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogen ##esis increases their trans ##lat ##ability and should el ##eva ##te the pre ##cl ##ini ##cal evaluation of mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic ##s and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) uses the s ##1 ( b ) domain of its spike protein to bind to dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , its functional receptor , and its s ##1 ( a ) domain to bind to si ##alic acids . the tissue local ##ization of d ##pp ##4 in humans , bats , camel ##ids , pigs , and rabbits generally co ##rre ##lates with mer ##s - co ##v tr ##op ##ism , highlighting the role of d ##pp ##4 in virus pathogen ##esis and transmission . however , mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 ( a ) does not ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nate ##ly bind to all α ##2 , 3 - si ##alic acids , and the species - specific binding and tissue distribution of these si ##alic acids in different mer ##s - co ##v - susceptible species have not been investigated . we established a novel method to detect these si ##alic acids on tissue sections of various organs of different susceptible species by using nano ##par ##tic ##les displaying multi ##valent mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 ( a ) . we found that the nano ##par ##tic ##les specifically bound to the nasal ep ##ith ##elial cells of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes in human lungs , and the int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells of common pip ##ist ##rell ##e bats . des ##ial ##yla ##tion by ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e abolished nano ##par ##tic ##le binding and significantly reduced mer ##s - co ##v infection in primary susceptible cells . in contrast , s ##1 ( a ) nano ##par ##tic ##les did not bind to the int ##estinal ep ##ith ##eli ##um of ser ##ot ##ine bats and fr ##ug ##ivo ##rous bat species , nor did they bind to the nasal ep ##ith ##eli ##um of pigs and rabbits . both pigs and rabbits have been shown to shed less infectious virus than dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and do not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes . our results depict species - specific col ##oca ##lization of mer ##s - co ##v entry and attachment receptors , which may be relevant in the transmission and pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v . importance mer ##s - co ##v uses the s ##1 ( b ) domain of its spike protein to attach to its host receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . the tissue local ##ization of d ##pp ##4 has been mapped in different susceptible species . on the other hand , the s ##1 ( a ) domain , the n - terminal domain of this spike protein , prefer ##ential ##ly binds to several g ##ly ##cot ##ope ##s of α ##2 , 3 - si
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a great public health concern globally . although 83 % of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in saudi arabia , the spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al cluster ##ing of mer ##s - co ##v incidence has not been investigated . this study anal ##yse ##d the spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al patterns and clusters of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases reported in saudi arabia between june 2012 and march 2019 . temporal , seasonal , spatial and spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al cluster analyses were performed using ku ##ll ##dorff ’ s spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest mer ##s - co ##v infection risk . a strongly significant temporal cluster for mer ##s - co ##v infection risk was identified between april 5 and may 24 , 2014 . most mer ##s - co ##v infections occurred during the spring season ( 41 . 88 % ) , with april and may showing significant seasonal clusters . wadi add ##awa ##sir showed a high - risk spatial cluster for mer ##s - co ##v infection . the most likely high - risk mer ##s - co ##v annual spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al clusters were identified for a group of cities ( n = 10 ) in ri ##yad ##h province between 2014 and 2016 . a monthly spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al cluster included jed ##dah , ma ##kka ##h and tai ##f cities , with the most likely high - risk mer ##s - co ##v infection cluster occurring between april and may 2014 . significant spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al clusters of mer ##s - co ##v incidence were identified in saudi arabia . the findings are relevant to control the spread of the disease . this study provides preliminary risk assessments for the further investigation of the environmental risk factors associated with mer ##s - co ##v clusters .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a deadly viral respiratory disease caused by mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . to date , there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease . in addition , no vaccine has been licensed to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection thus far . therefore , our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective mer ##s vaccine . overall , vaccine candidates against mer ##s - co ##v are mainly based upon the viral spike ( s ) protein , due to its vital role in the viral in ##fect ##ivity , although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein , envelope ( e ) protein , and non - structural protein 16 ( ns ##p ##16 ) have also been reported . in general , the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types : viral vector - based vaccine , dna vaccine , subunit vaccine , nano ##par ##tic ##le - based vaccine , inactivated - whole virus vaccine and live - at ##ten ##uated vaccine , which are discussed in detail . besides , the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of mer ##s - co ##v infection are extensively reviewed . in addition , animal models used to study mer ##s - co ##v and evaluate the vaccine candidates are discussed intensive ##ly .  
outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 , middle east respiratory syndrome in 2012 and fatal sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome in 2017 caused serious infectious diseases in humans and in livestock , resulting in serious public health threats and huge economic losses . all such corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) were confirmed to originate from bats . to continuously monitor the epidemic - related co ##vs in bats , vi ##rom ##e analysis was used to classify co ##vs from 83 ##1 bats of 15 species in yunnan , gu ##ang ##xi , and sichuan provinces between august 2016 and may 2017 . we identified 11 co ##v strains from 22 individual samples of four bat species . identification of four alpha - co ##vs from sc ##oto ##phi ##lus ku ##hli ##i in gu ##ang ##xi , which was closely related to a previously reported bat co ##v and por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus ( pe ##d ##v ) , revealed a bat - sw ##ine lineage under the genus alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus . a rec ##om ##bina ##nt co ##v showed that the pe ##d ##v probably originated from the co ##v of s . ku ##hli ##i . another alpha - co ##v , α - y ##n ##20 ##18 , from rhino ##lo ##phus af ##fin ##is in yunnan , suggested that this alpha - co ##v lineage had multiple host origins , and α - y ##n ##20 ##18 had rec ##om ##bine ##d with co ##vs of other bat species over time . we identified five sar ##s - related co ##vs ( sar ##sr - co ##vs ) in rhino ##lo ##phus bats from sichuan and yunnan and confirmed that ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 usable sar ##sr - co ##vs were continuously circulating in rhino ##lo ##phus spp . in yunnan . the other beta - co ##v , strain β - g ##x ##20 ##18 , found in cy ##no ##pt ##erus sphinx of gu ##ang ##xi , represented an independently evolved lineage different from known co ##vs of rouse ##tt ##us and e ##ony ##cter ##is bats . the identification of diverse co ##vs here provides new genetic data for understanding the distribution and source of pathogen ##ic co ##vs in china .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries , especially in the arabian peninsula . mer ##s - co ##v is considered an ideal example of the one health concept . this is due to the animals , especially dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus , and the virus can be transmitted through aero ##sol ##s of infected patients into the environment . however , there is some debate regarding the origin of mer ##s - co ##v either from bats or other unknown reservoirs . the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date . these animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secret ##ing it in their body fluids , especially in nasal and rec ##tal discharge ##s . mer ##s - co ##v has been detected in the nasal and rec ##tal secret ##ions of infected camel ##s , and mer ##s - co ##v of this origin has full capacity to in ##fect human air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um in both in vitro and in vivo models . other evidence confirms the direct transmission of mer ##s - co ##v from camel ##s to humans , though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied . human - to - human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons . furthermore , there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive mer ##s - co ##v patient , including sleeping in the same patient room , removing patient waste ( urine , stool , and sp ##ut ##um ) , and touching respiratory secret ##ions from the index case . outbreak ##s within family clusters have been reported , whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected . some pre ##dis ##po ##sing genetic factors favor mer ##s - co ##v infection in some patients , which is worth investigating in the near future . the presence of other como ##rb ##idi ##ties may be another factor . overall , there are many unknown / confirmed aspects of the virus / human / animal network . here , the most recent advances in this context are discussed , and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of mer ##s - co ##v in certain regions are presented . identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of mer ##s - co ##v from camel ##s to humans and searching for new reservoir / s are of high priority . this will reduce the shed ##ding of the virus into the environment , and thus the risk of human infection can be mit ##igate ##d .  
purpose : this study represents the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ological status of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) worldwide in the first three months of 2019 . patients and methods : full details of the mer ##s - co ##v cases available and published in the disease outbreak news on the who website were retrieved . related details of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods . results : a total of 107 cases of mer ##s - co ##v , including 18 deaths ( overall case fatal ##ity rate ( cf ##r ) , 16 . 8 % ; male - specific cf ##r was 17 . 5 % [ 14 / 80 ] and female - specific cf ##r was 14 . 8 % [ 4 / 27 ] ) were reported to who from the national international health regulation focal points of saudi arabia and oman . the overall mean age was 50 ##± ##17 years and 80 patients ( 74 . 8 % ) were male . the average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospital ##ization was 3 ##± ##3 . 3 days ; from the first hospital ##ization to laboratory confirmation was 3 . 6 ##± ##6 . 5 days ; from the onset of sy ##mpt ##om to death was 17 . 5 ##± ##11 . 7 days ; and the mean length of hospital ##ization for patients with mer ##s - co ##v was 3 . 5 ##± ##3 . 9 days . males in comparison to females had a 1 . 5 - fold increased chance ( adjusted or = 1 . 5 [ 95 % ci : 1 . 3 – 1 . 8 ] ) of death related to mer ##s - co ##v infection ; 1 . 05 [ 95 % ci : 1 . 1 – 3 . 3 ] , 1 . 05 [ 95 % ci : 1 . 2 – 2 . 8 ] and 1 . 06 [ 95 % ci : 1 . 2 – 2 . 0 ] for those who had exposure to camel ##s , camel milk consumption , and close contact with mer ##s - co ##v cases , respectively . health care workers had 2 . 4 fold [ 95 % ci : 1 . 2 – 3 . 1 ] greater odds of death compared to other people . conclusion : the knowledge obtained from this study can contribute to the development of a prevention program and early system warning against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the natural reservoirs of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . camel ##s are mostly bred in east african countries then exported into africa and middle east for consumption . to understand the distribution of mer ##s - co ##v among camel ##s in north africa and the middle east , we conducted surveillance in egypt , senegal , tunisia , uganda , jordan , saudi arabia , and iraq . we also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in egypt and jordan to el ##uc ##ida ##te mer ##s - co ##v infection and transmission . between 2016 and 2018 , a total of 402 ##7 nasal sw ##ab ##s and 326 ##7 serum samples were collected from all countries . real - time pc ##r revealed that mer ##s - co ##v rna was detected in nasal sw ##ab samples from egypt , senegal , tunisia , and saudi arabia . micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries . positive pc ##r samples were partially sequence ##d , and a phylogenetic tree was built . the tree suggested that all sequences are of clade c and sequences from camel ##s in egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences . longitudinal studies showed high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce in adult camel ##s . these results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camel ##s . a systematic active surveillance and longitudinal studies for mer ##s - co ##v are needed to understand the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the disease and dynamics of viral infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections in humans can cause as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to fatal lower respiratory lung disease . despite posing a probable risk for virus transmission , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to mild infections can go unnoticed ; a lack of ser ##oco ##n ##version among some pc ##r - confirmed cases has been reported . we found that a mer ##s - co ##v spike s ##1 protein – based elisa , routinely used in surveillance studies , showed low sensitivity in detecting infections among pc ##r - confirmed patients with mild clinical symptoms and cross - react ##ivity of human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 – positive serum samples . using in - house s ##1 elisa and protein micro ##ar ##ray , we demonstrate that most pc ##r - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v case - patients with mild infections ser ##oco ##n ##verted ; nonetheless , some of these samples did not have detect ##able levels of virus - neutral ##izing antibodies . the use of a sensitive and specific ser ##olo ##gic s ##1 - based ass ##ay can be instrumental in the accurate estimation of mer ##s - co ##v prevalence .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was detected in humans in 2012 . since then , sporadic outbreak ##s with primary transmission through dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to humans and outbreak ##s in healthcare settings have shown that mer ##s - co ##v continues to pose a threat to human health . several ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays for mer ##s - co ##v have been developed globally . we describe a collaborative study to investigate the com ##para ##bility of ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays for mer ##s - co ##v and assess any benefit associated with the introduction of a standard reference re ##age ##nt for mer ##s - co ##v ser ##ology . our study findings indicate that , when possible , laboratories should use a testing algorithm including > 2 tests to ensure correct diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v . we also demonstrate that the use of a reference re ##age ##nt greatly improves the agreement between ass ##ays , enabling more consistent and therefore more meaningful comparisons between results .  
corona ##virus m proteins represent the major protein component of the viral envelope . they play an essential role during viral assembly by interacting with all of the other structural proteins . corona ##virus ##es bud into the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) – go ##l ##gi intermediate compartment ( er ##gic ) , but the mechanisms by which m proteins are transported from their site of synthesis , the er , to the bud ##ding site remain poorly understood . here , we investigated the intra ##cellular trafficking of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) m protein . sub ##cellular local ##ization analyses revealed that the mer ##s - co ##v m protein is retained intra ##cellular ##ly in the trans - go ##l ##gi network ( t ##gn ) , and we identified two motifs in the distal part of the c - terminal domain as being important for this specific local ##ization . we identified the first motif as a functional dia ##ci ##dic d ##x ##e er export signal , because sub ##stituting as ##p - 211 and g ##lu - 213 with alan ##ine induced retention of the mer ##s - co ##v m in the er . the second motif , ( 199 ) k ##x ##g ##xy ##r ( 204 ) , was responsible for retaining the m protein in the t ##gn . substitution of this motif resulted in mer ##s - co ##v m leak ##age toward the plasma membrane . we further confirmed the role of ( 199 ) k ##x ##g ##xy ##r ( 204 ) as a t ##gn retention signal by using chi ##mer ##as between mer ##s - co ##v m and the m protein of infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) . our results indicated that the c - terminal domains of both proteins determine their specific local ##ization , namely t ##gn and er ##gic / cis - go ##l ##gi for mer ##s - m and ib ##v - m , respectively . our findings indicate that mer ##s - co ##v m protein local ##izes to the t ##gn because of the combined presence of an er export signal and a t ##gn retention motif .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) are two corona ##virus ##es with demonstrated potential to generate significant nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s . in particular , mer ##s continues to pose a significant threat in the middle east since 2012 . currently , no licensed vaccine or drug treatment is available to treat patients infected with either corona ##virus . however , there are some mer ##s vaccines in the pre ##cl ##ini ##cal stage of development . we sought to evaluate the potential impact of targeted va ##cci ##nation strategies for mit ##iga ##ting sar ##s and mer ##s outbreak ##s in healthcare settings using simple mathematical models and detailed historic transmission trees describing the progression of past nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s of sar ##s and mer ##s . results : our findings suggest that va ##cci ##nation strategies targeting patients and healthcare workers , which have been di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ately affected during past outbreak ##s , and assuming two va ##cci ##nation coverage levels at 50 and 75 % have the potential to ave ##rt nearly 50 % or more of mer ##s or sar ##s cases . conclusion : our modeling results informed by historic outbreak data for sar ##s and mer ##s suggest that va ##cci ##nation strategies targeting patients could be an effective measure to mit ##igate and prevent outbreak ##s in the healthcare setting . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( 10 . 118 ##6 / s ##12 ##9 ##7 ##6 - 01 ##9 - 01 ##12 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging virus that causes severe disease with fatal outcomes ; however , there are currently no approved vaccines or specific treatments against mer ##s - co ##v . here , we developed a novel bi ##valent vaccine against mer ##s - co ##v and ra ##bies virus ( rv ) using the replication - inc ##omp ##ete ##nt p - gene - def ##icient rv ( rv ##δ ##p ) , which has been previously established as a promising and safe viral vector . mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein comprises s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s , with the s ##1 subunit being a primary target of neutral ##izing antibodies . rec ##om ##bina ##nt rv ##δ ##p , which expresses s ##1 fused with trans ##me ##mb ##rane and cy ##top ##las ##mic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ec ##to ##dom ##ains of the rv - g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( rv - g ) , was developed using a reverse genetics method and named rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 . following generation of rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 and rv ##δ ##p , our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties , with the expression of s ##1 in rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 - infected cells confirmed by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and western b ##lot , and the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and pathogen ##ici ##ty evaluated using mouse infection experiments . we observed no ra ##bies - associated signs or symptoms in mice in ##oc ##ulated with rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 . moreover , virus - specific neutral ##izing antibodies against both mer ##s - co ##v and rv were induced in mice in ##oc ##ulated intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly with rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 . these findings indicate that rv ##δ ##p - mer ##s / s ##1 is a promising and safe bi ##valent - vaccine candidate against both mer ##s - co ##v and rv .  
since its first report in the middle east in 2012 , the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has become a global concern due to the high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality of individuals infected with the virus . although the majority of mer ##s - co ##v cases have been reported in saudi arabia , the overall risk in areas outside the middle east remains significant as inside saudi arabia . additional pan ##de ##mics of mer ##s - co ##v are expected , and thus novel tools and re ##age ##nts for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed . here , we used ph ##age display to develop novel mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) that target mer ##s - co ##v . a human fa ##b ph ##age display library was pan ##ned against the s ##2 subunit of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein ( mer ##s - s ##2 ##p ) , yielding three unique fa ##bs ( s ##2 ##a ##3 , s ##2 ##a ##6 , and s ##2 ##d ##5 ) . the fa ##bs had moderate apparent af ##fin ##ities ( half maximal effective concentration ( ec ( 50 ) = 123 – 421 nm ) for mer ##s - s ##2 ##p , showed no cross - react ##ivity to spike proteins from other co ##vs , and were non - ag ##gre ##gating and the ##rm ##osta ##ble ( t ( m ) = 61 . 5 – 80 . 4 °c ) . reform ##att ##ing the fa ##bs into i ##ggs ( im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin gs ) greatly increased their apparent af ##fin ##ities ( k ( d ) = 0 . 17 – 1 . 2 nm ) , presumably due to the effects of avid ##ity . these apparent af ##fin ##ities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti - mer ##s - co ##v s ##2 reference mab ( k ( d ) = 8 . 7 nm ) . furthermore , two of the three mab ##s ( s ##2 ##a ##3 and s ##2 ##d ##5 ) bound only mer ##s - co ##v ( erasmus medical center ( em ##c ) ) and not other co ##vs , reflecting their high binding specific ##ity . however , the mab ##s lacked mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing activity . given their high affinity , specific ##ity , and desirable stab ##ili ##ties , we anti ##ci ##pate that these anti - mer ##s - co ##v mab ##s would be suitable re ##age ##nts for developing antibody - based diagnostic ##s in laboratory or hospital settings for point - of - care testing .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a new corona ##virus that has been causing severe and fatal acute respiratory illnesses in humans since its outbreak in 2012 , has raised public fear worldwide . the development of prop ##hyl ##actic ##s and therapeutic ##s is urgently needed to prevent and control mer ##s - co ##v infections . in this study , a bacterium ( lac ##to ##co ##ccus lac ##tis ) - like particle ( b ##lp ) vaccine displaying the mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) was developed , and gram - positive enhance ##r matrix ( gem ) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d through a protein anchor ( pa ) . the designs included different numbers of l ##ys ##in motif ( l ##ys ##m ) repeats in the pas linked by link ##ers ( rb ##d - link ##er - pa ##2 ( r ##lp ( 2 ) ) , rb ##d - link ##er - pa ##3 ( r ##lp ( 3 ) ) and rb ##d - pa ##3 ( r ##p ( 3 ) ) ) , and three l ##ys ##m repeats and a link ##er in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the rb ##d . the specific immune responses were tested by intra ##nas ##ally im ##mun ##izing mice with r ##lp ( 3 ) - gem with or without the ad ##ju ##vant gel ##01 . the results showed that gel ##01 - ad ##ju ##vant ##ed r ##lp ( 3 ) - gem increased the systemic humor ##al , cellular and local mu ##cos ##al immune responses in the mouse model , especially in the int ##estinal tract . the above results indicate that the mer ##s - co ##v b ##lp product has the potential to be developed into a promising mu ##cos ##al candidate vaccine to protect against mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
corona ##virus ##es represent current and emerging threats for many species , including humans . middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is responsible for sporadic infections in mostly middle eastern countries , with occasional transfer elsewhere . a key step in the mer ##s - co ##v replication cycle is the fusion of the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the virus spike protein , s . the location of the fusion peptide within the mer ##s s protein has not been precisely mapped . we used isolated peptide ##s and giant un ##ila ##mel ##lar ve ##sic ##les ( gu ##v ) to demonstrate membrane binding for a peptide located near the n - terminus of the s ##2 domain . key residues required for activity were mapped by amino acid replacement and their relevance in vitro tested by their introduction into rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s s protein expressed in mammalian cells . mutations preventing membrane binding in vitro also abolished s - mediated sync ##yt ##ium formation consistent with the identified peptide acting as the fusion peptide for the s protein of mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic disease transmitted from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to people , which can result in outbreak ##s with human - to - human transmission . because it is a sub ##cl ##ini ##cal infection in camel ##s , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological measures other than prevalence are challenging to assess . this study estimated the force of infection ( f ##oi ) of mer ##s - co ##v in camel populations from age - st ##rat ##ified ser ##ological data . a cross - sectional study of mer ##s - co ##v was conducted in kenya from july 2016 to july 2017 . ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce was st ##rat ##ified into four age groups : < 1 , 1 – 2 , 2 – 3 and > 3 years old . age - independent and age - dependent linear and quad ##ratic general ##ised linear models were used to estimate f ##oi in pastoral and ranch ##ing camel herds . models were compared based on computed ai ##c values . among pastoral herds , the age - dependent quad ##ratic f ##oi was the best fit model , while the age - independent f ##oi was the best fit for the ranch ##ing herd data . f ##oi provides an indirect estimate of infection risk , which is especially valuable where direct estimates of incidence and other measures of infection are challenging to obtain . the f ##ois estimated in this study provide important insight about mer ##s - co ##v dynamics in the reservoir species , and contribute to our understanding of the zoo ##not ##ic risks of this important public health threat .  
a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) has been discovered . the detection of both antigen ##s and antibodies in sar ##s ‐ co ##v from human specimens with suspected sar ##s plays an important role in preventing infection . we developed a novel rapid im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic test ( ric ##t ) based on the sandwich format enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y ( e ##ia ) with an all ‐ in ‐ one device for detecting the native nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antigen ( n ‐ ag ) of sar ##s ‐ co ##v using mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mo ##ab ##s ) , which we produced by im ##mun ##izing rec ##om ##bina ##nt n ‐ ag to mice . ric ##t is a qu ##ali ##tative ass ##ay for respiratory as ##pi ##rates and serum specimens . with this ass ##ay , a positive result can be judged subjective ##ly by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied . ric ##t with several pairs of mo ##ab ##s showed a high sensitivity for the detection of rec ##om ##bina ##nt n ‐ ag as well as viral n ‐ ag of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . rs ##n ##12 ##2 and rs ##n ##21 ‐ 2 were the best mo ##ab ##s for im ##mo ##bil ##ized antibody and enzyme labeling , respectively . with regard to analytical sensitivity , ric ##t detected n ‐ ag at 31 pg / ml for rec ##om ##bina ##nt n ‐ ag , and at 1 . 99 ##× ##10 ( 2 ) tc ##id ( 50 ) / ml for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the specific ##ity of ric ##t was 100 % when 150 human sera and 50 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates ( ns ##ps ) were used . ric ##t based on an e ##ia using the rs ##n ##12 ##2 / rs ##n ##21 ‐ 2 pair is a sensitive , specific , and reliable rapid ass ##ay for detecting n ‐ ag in sar ##s ‐ co ##v treated with either heat or tri ##ton x ‐ 100 . j . cl ##in . lab . anal . 19 : 150 – 159 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are important reservoir hosts of various corona ##virus ##es , including middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) that cause human infections . co ##v genome ##s regularly undergo rec ##om ##bina ##tion during infection as observed in bat sar ##s - related co ##vs . here we report for the first time that only a small proportion of mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain positive ( rb ##d ) of spike protein positive camel sera in kenya were also ser ##op ##osi ##tive to mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( np ) . in contrast , many of them contain antibodies against bat hk ##u ##8 - related ( hk ##u ##8 ##r ) - co ##vs . among 58 ##4 camel samples that were positive against mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d , we found only 0 . 48 ( 8 . 22 % ) samples were also positive for np . furthermore , we found bat hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v np antibody in 73 ( 12 . 5 % ) of the mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d positive and np negative samples , yet found only 3 ( 0 . 43 % ) of the hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v s ##1 antibody in the same samples . these findings may indicate co - infection with mer ##s - co ##v and a hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v in camel ##s . it may also raise the possibility of the circulation of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt corona ##virus virus with the spike of mer ##s - co ##v and the np of a hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v in kenya . we failed to find molecular evidence of an hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v or a put ##ative rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus . our findings should alert other investigators to look for molecular evidence of hk ##u ##8 ##r - co ##v or rec ##om ##bina ##nts .  
enter ##ic viruses exploit bacterial components , including lip ##op ##ol ##ys ##ac ##cha ##ride ##s ( lp ##s ) and pep ##ti ##dog ##ly ##can ( pg ) , to facilitate infection in humans . because of their origin in the bat enter ##ic system , we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) or middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) also use bacterial components to mod ##ulate in ##fect ##ivity . to test this question , we inc ##uba ##ted co ##vs with lp ##s and pg and evaluated in ##fect ##ivity , finding no change following lp ##s treatment . however , pg from ba ##ci ##llus sub ##ti ##lis reduced infection > 10 , 000 - fold , while pg from other bacterial species failed to rec ##ap ##it ##ulate this . treatment with an alcohol solvent transferred inhibitor ##y activity to the wash , and mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry revealed surf ##act ##in , a cyclic lip ##ope ##pt ##ide anti ##biotic , as the inhibitor ##y compound . this anti ##biotic had robust dose - and temperature - dependent inhibition of co ##v in ##fect ##ivity . me ##chan ##istic studies indicated that surf ##act ##in disrupt ##s co ##v vi ##rion integrity , and surf ##act ##in treatment of the virus in ##oc ##ulum ab ##lated infection in vivo . finally , similar cyclic lip ##ope ##pt ##ides had no effect on co ##v in ##fect ##ivity , and the inhibitor ##y effect of surf ##act ##in extended broadly to enveloped viruses , including influenza , e ##bola , z ##ika , ni ##pa ##h , chi ##ku ##ng ##un ##ya , una , maya ##ro , dug ##be , and crimean - congo hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever viruses . overall , our results indicate that pep ##ti ##dog ##ly ##can - associated surf ##act ##in has broad vi ##ric ##idal activity and suggest that bacteria by - products may negatively mod ##ulate virus infection . importance in this article , we consider a role for bacteria in shaping corona ##virus infection . taking cues from studies of enter ##ic viruses , we initially investigated how bacterial surface components might improve co ##v infection . instead , we found that pep ##ti ##dog ##ly ##can - associated surf ##act ##in is a potent vi ##ric ##idal compound that disrupt ##s vi ##rion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses . our results indicate that interactions with com ##men ##sal bacterial may improve or disrupt viral infections , highlighting the importance of understanding these micro ##bial interactions and their implications for viral pathogen ##esis and treatment .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) induce ##s severe ag ##gra ##vating respiratory failure in infected patients , frequently resulting in mechanical ventilation . as limited therapeutic antibody is accumulated in lung tissue following systemic administration , in ##hala ##tion is newly recognized as an alternative , possibly better , route of therapeutic antibody for pulmonary diseases . the ne ##bu ##lization process , however , generates diverse physiological stresses , and thus , the therapeutic antibody must be resistant to these stresses , remain stable , and form minimal aggregate ##s . we first isolated a mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibody that is reactive to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . to increase stability , we introduced mutations into the complement ##ari ##ty - determining regions ( cd ##rs ) of the antibody . in the hc ##dr ##s ( excluding hc ##dr ##3 ) in this clone , two hydro ##phobic residues were replaced with g ##lu , two residues were replaced with as ##p , and four residues were replaced with positively charged amino acids . in lcd ##rs , only two le ##u residues were replaced with val . these modifications successfully generated a clone with significantly greater stability and equivalent react ##ivity and neutral ##izing activity following ne ##bu ##lization compared to the original clone . in summary , we generated a mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing human antibody that is reactive to rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v s rb ##d protein for delivery via a pulmonary route by introducing stab ##ili ##zing mutations into five cd ##rs .  
mer ##s - co ##v ser ##one ##gative and ser ##op ##osi ##tive camel ##s received a single intra ##mus ##cular dose of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , a replication - def ##icient aden ##ov ##ira ##l vector ##ed vaccine expressing mer ##s - co ##v spike protein , with further groups receiving control va ##cci ##nation ##s . infectious camel ##s with active naturally acquired mer ##s - co ##v infection , were co - housed with the va ##cci ##nated camel ##s at a ratio of 1 : 2 ( infected : va ##cci ##nated ) ; nasal discharge and virus ti ##tres were monitored for 14 days . overall , the va ##cci ##nation reduced virus shed ##ding and nasal discharge ( p = 0 . 00 ##59 and p = 0 . 02 ##7 ##4 , respectively ) . antibody responses in ser ##op ##osi ##tive camel ##s were enhanced ##by the vaccine ; these camel ##s had a higher average age than ser ##one ##gative . older ser ##one ##gative camel ##s responded more strongly to va ##cci ##nation than younger animals ; and neutral ##ising antibodies were detected in nasal sw ##ab ##s . further work is required to opt ##imi ##se vaccine regime ##ns for younger ser ##one ##gative camel ##s .  
background : among the countries affected by middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , saudi arabia was impacted the most , with 2 , 05 ##8 cases reported as of june 2019 . however , the impact of the mer ##s epidemic on the saudi economy is unknown . purpose : the present study aimed to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with the management of mer ##s cases at a tertiary refer ##ral hospital in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia . methods : the study involved a retrospective chart review of confirmed cases of mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections in a tertiary care refer ##ral center in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , from january 2015 to october 2018 . the collected data included socio ##de ##mo ##graphic characteristics , medical information , and the cost of hospital ##ization of each patient as estimated by micro - costing . results : a complete set of relevant information was available only for 24 of 44 identified mer ##s - co ##v cases . patients were mostly females , and the mean age was 52 years . diabetes , hyper ##tension , and chronic kidney disease were the most frequent como ##rb ##idi ##ties . the length of hospital stay varied from 1 to 31 days , averaging 4 . 96 ± 7 . 29 days . two of the 24 patients died . the total cost of managing a mer ##s case at the hospital ranged from $ 127 ##8 . 41 to $ 75 , 98 ##7 . 95 with a mean cost of $ 12 , 94 ##7 . 03 ± $ 19 , 92 ##3 . 14 . conclusion : the findings of this study highlight the enormous expenses incurred by the saudi health care system due to the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak and the importance of developing an enforce ##able nationwide policy to control mer ##s - co ##v transmission and infection .  
the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak ##s pose a worldwide public health threat . blocking mer ##s - co ##v zoo ##not ##ic transmission from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , the animal reservoir , could potentially reduce the number of primary human cases . here we report mer ##s - co ##v transmission from experimental ##ly infected ll ##ama ##s to naive animals . directly in ##oc ##ulated ll ##ama ##s shed virus for at least 6 days and could in ##fect all in - contact naive animals 4 – 5 days after exposure . with the aim to block virus transmission , we examined the efficacy of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike s ##1 - protein vaccine . in contrast to naive animals , in - contact va ##cci ##nated ll ##ama ##s did not shed infectious virus upon exposure to directly in ##oc ##ulated ll ##ama ##s , consistent with the induction of strong virus neutral ##izing antibody responses . our data provide further evidence that va ##cci ##nation of the reservoir host may imp ##ede mer ##s - co ##v zoo ##not ##ic transmission to humans .  
background : it has been 8 years since the first case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was reported in saudi arabia and the disease is still being reported in 27 countries ; however , there is no international study to estimate the overall burden related of this emerging infectious disease . the present study was conducted to assess the burden of premature mortality due to middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) worldwide . methods : in this retrospective analysis , we have utilized publicly available data from the who website related to 1789 mer ##s patients reported between september 23 , 2012 and may 17 , 2019 . to calculate the standard expected years of life lost ( se ##yl ##l ) , life expect ##ancy at birth was set according to the 2000 global burden of disease study on levels 25 and 26 of west model life tables from coal ##e - dem ##en ##y at 82 . 5 and 80 years for females and males , respectively . results : overall , the total se ##yl ##l in males and females was 10 , 70 ##2 and 381 ##7 . 5 years , respectively . the mer ##s patients within the age range of 30 – 59 year - olds had the highest se ##yl ##l ( 83 ##0 ##5 . 5 years ) in comparison to the patients within the age groups 0 – 29 ( se ##yl ##l = 37 ##44 . 5 years ) and ≥ 60 years ( se ##yl ##l = 246 ##6 . 5 years ) . the total se ##yl ##l in all age groups in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 were 71 . 5 , 2006 . 5 , 316 ##2 , 44 ##25 . 5 , 1809 . 5 , 87 ##8 , 125 ##7 . 5 and 90 ##9 years , respectively . the most se ##yl ##l related to mer ##s - co ##v infection was in the early four years of the onset of the pan ##de ##mic ( 2012 to 2015 ) and in the last four years of the mer ##s - co ##v pan ##de ##mic ( 216 to 2019 ) , a significant reduction was observed in the se ##yl ##l related to mer ##s - co ##v infection in the mer ##s patients . conclusion : we believe that the findings of this study will shed light about the burden of premature mortality due to mer ##s infection in the world and the results may provide necessary information for policy - makers to prevent , control , and make a quick response to the outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v disease .  
background and aim : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has rapidly spread throughout the middle east since its discovery in 2012 . the virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects . in this study , a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##ira ##l - based vaccine encoding the spike 1 ( s ##1 ) subunit of the mer ##s - co ##v genome was constructed , and its humor ##al , and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice . materials and methods : mice were im ##mun ##ized initially by intra ##mus ##cular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intra ##nas ##al application . expression of the s ##1 protein in the lungs and kidney ##s was detected using conventional polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry ( i ##hc ) targeting specific regions within the s ##1 subunit at weeks 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 after the first va ##cci ##nation . antigen - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9 - mer ep ##ito ##pe within the s ##1 protein ( cy ##ss ##li ##ld ##y ) . results : s ##1 protein expression was only detected by i ##hc in the kidney ##s of the ad - mer ##s - s ##1 group at week 6 from first im ##mun ##ization , and in both lungs and kidney ##s of ad - mer ##s - s ##1 group by conventional pc ##r at weeks 3 and 5 post - prime . the vaccine eli ##cite ##d a specific s ##1 - im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g antibody response , which was detected in the sera of the va ##cci ##nated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first im ##mun ##ization . there was a significant increase in the amount of th ##1 - related cy ##tok ##ines ( inter ##fer ##on - γ and inter ##le ##uki ##n [ il ] 12 ) , and a significant decrease in the th ##2 - related cy ##tok ##ine il - 4 in sp ##len ##oc ##yte cell culture of the va ##cci ##nated group compared with the control groups . conclusion : the results of this study suggest that this rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus vaccine encoding the s ##1 subunit of mer ##s - co ##v eli ##cit ##s potentially protective antigen - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses in mice . this study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and / or prevention of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans .  
a high percentage of camel handler ##s in saudi arabia are ser ##op ##osi ##tive for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus . we found that 12 / 100 camel handler ##s and their family members in pakistan , a country with extensive camel mer ##s - co ##v infection , were ser ##op ##osi ##tive , indicating that mer ##s - co ##v infection of these populations extends beyond the arabian peninsula .  
we tested samples collected from camel ##s , camel workers , and other animals in sudan and qatar in 2015 and 2017 for evidence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . mer ##s - co ##v antibodies were abundant in sudan camel ##s , but we found no evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection in camel workers , other livestock , or bats .  
outbreak ##s of severe dia ##rr ##hea in neon ##atal pig ##lets in guangdong , china , in 2017 resulted in the isolation and discovery of a novel sw ##ine enter ##ic alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ( sea ##co ##v ) derived from the species rhino ##lo ##phus bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##2 ( y . pan , x . tian , p . qin , b . wang , et al . , vet micro ##bio ##l 211 : 15 – 21 , 2017 ) . sea ##co ##v was later referred to as sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome co ##v ( sad ##s - co ##v ) by another group ( p . zhou , h . fan , t . lan , x . - l . yang , et al . , nature 55 ##6 : 255 – 258 , 2018 ) . the present study was set up to investigate the potential species barriers of sad ##s - co ##v in vitro and in vivo . we first demonstrated that sad ##s - co ##v possesses a broad species tr ##op ##ism and is able to in ##fect cell lines from diverse species , including bats , mice , rats , ge ##rb ##ils , ham ##sters , pigs , chickens , non ##hum ##an primate ##s , and humans . try ##ps ##in contributes to but is not essential for sad ##s - co ##v propagation in vitro . furthermore , c ##57 ##bl / 6 ##j mice were in ##oc ##ulated with the virus via oral or intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l routes . although the mice exhibited only sub ##cl ##ini ##cal infection , they supported viral replication and prolonged infection in the sp ##leen . sad ##s - co ##v non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins and double - stranded rna were detected in sp ##len ##ocytes of the marginal zone on the edge of l ##ym ##pha ##tic f ##oll ##icles , indicating active replication of sad ##s - co ##v in the mouse model . we identified that sp ##len ##ic den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) are the major targets of virus infection by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry approaches . finally , we demonstrated that sad ##s - co ##v does not utilize known co ##v receptors for cellular entry . the ability of sad ##s - co ##v to replicate in various cells lines from a broad range of species and the unexpected tr ##op ##ism for mu ##rine dc ##s provide important insights into the biology of this bat - origin co ##v , highlighting its possible ability to cross inter ##sp ##ec ##ies barriers . importance infections with bat - origin corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) ( severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v [ sar ##s - co ##v ] and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v [ mer ##s - co ##v ] ) have caused severe illness in humans after
there were severe panic ##s caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle - east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus . therefore , researches targeting these viruses have been required . corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have been rising targets of some fl ##av ##ono ##ids . the anti ##vira ##l activity of some fl ##av ##ono ##ids against co ##vs is presumed directly caused by inhibit ##ing 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) . here , we applied a fl ##av ##ono ##id library to systematically probe inhibitor ##y compounds against sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . herb ##ace ##tin , r ##ho ##if ##olin and pe ##ct ##olin ##ari ##n were found to efficiently block the en ##zy ##matic activity of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . the interaction of the three fl ##av ##ono ##ids was confirmed using a try ##pt ##op ##han - based flu ##orescence method , too . an induced - fit docking analysis indicated that s ##1 , s ##2 and s ##3 ′ sites are involved in binding with fl ##av ##ono ##ids . the comparison with previous studies showed that tri ##ton x - 100 played a critical role in object ##ing false positive or over ##est ##imated inhibitor ##y activity of fl ##av ##ono ##ids . with the systematic analysis , the three fl ##av ##ono ##ids are suggested to be template ##s to design functional ##ly improved inhibitors .  
while dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are the immediate animal source of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) epidemic , viruses related to mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have also been found in bats as well as hedge ##hog ##s . to el ##uc ##ida ##te the evolution of mer ##s - co ##v - related viruses and their inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission pathway , samples were collected from different mammals in china . a novel corona ##virus related to mer ##s - co ##v , erin ##ace ##us am ##ure ##nsis hedge ##hog corona ##virus hk ##u ##31 ( ea - he ##dc ##ov hk ##u ##31 ) , was identified from two am ##ur hedge ##hog ##s . genome analysis supported that ea - he ##dc ##ov hk ##u ##31 represents a novel species under mer ##be ##co ##virus , being most closely related to erin ##ace ##us co ##v from european hedge ##hog ##s in germany , with 79 . 6 % genome sequence identity . compared to other members of mer ##be ##co ##virus , ea - he ##dc ##ov hk ##u ##31 possessed unique non - structural proteins and put ##ative cleavage sites at or ##f ##1 ##ab . phylogenetic analysis showed that ea - he ##dc ##ov hk ##u ##31 and beta ##co ##v erin ##ace ##us / v ##mc / de ##u / 2012 were closely related to neo ##co ##v and bat ##co ##v predict from african bats in the spike region , suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arise ##n from rec ##om ##bina ##tion between co ##vs from hedge ##hog ##s and bats . the predicted hk ##u ##31 receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) , the mer ##s - co ##v receptor . the structural modeling of the hk ##u ##31 - rb ##d - hd ##pp ##4 binding inter ##pha ##se compared to that of mer ##s - co ##v and ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is bat co ##v hk ##u ##4 ( ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 ) suggested that hk ##u ##31 - rb ##d is unlikely to bind to hd ##pp ##4 . our findings support that hedge ##hog ##s are an important reservoir of mer ##be ##co ##virus , with evidence of rec ##om ##bina ##tion with viruses from bats . further investigations in bats , hedge ##hog ##s and related animals are warrant ##ed to understand the evolution of mer ##s - co ##v - related viruses .  
as a world health organization research and development blue ##print priority pathogen , there is a need to better understand the geographic distribution of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and its potential to in ##fect mammals and humans . this database documents cases of mer ##s - co ##v globally , with specific attention paid to zoo ##not ##ic transmission . an initial literature search was conducted in pub ##med , web of science , and sc ##opus ; after screening articles according to the inclusion / exclusion criteria , a total of 208 sources were selected for extraction and geo - positioning . each mer ##s - co ##v occurrence was assigned one of the following classifications based upon published context ##ual information : index , unspecified , secondary , mammal , environmental , or imported . in total , this database is comprised of 86 ##1 unique geo - positioned mer ##s - co ##v occurrences . the purpose of this article is to share a col ##lated mer ##s - co ##v database and extraction protocol that can be utilized in future mapping efforts for both mer ##s - co ##v and other infectious diseases . more broadly , it may also provide useful data for the development of targeted mer ##s - co ##v surveillance , which would prove in ##val ##ua ##ble in preventing future zoo ##not ##ic spill ##over .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , which is not fully understood in regard to certain transmission routes and pathogen ##esis and lacks specific therapeutic ##s and vaccines , poses a global threat to public health . methods : to simulate the clinical aero ##sol transmission route , hd ##pp ##4 trans ##genic mice were infected with mer ##s ‐ co ##v by an animal nose ‐ only exposure device and compared with ins ##till ##ation ‐ in ##oc ##ulated mice . the challenged mice were observed for 14 consecutive days and nec ##rop ##sie ##d on days 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 to analyze viral load , his ##top ##ath ##ology , viral antigen distribution , and cy ##tok ##ines in tissues . results : mer ##s ‐ co ##v aero ##sol ‐ infected mice with an inc ##uba ##tion period of 5 ‐ 7 days showed weight loss on days 7 ‐ 11 , obvious lung lesions on day 7 , high viral loads in the lungs on days 3 ‐ 9 and in the brain on days 7 ‐ 9 , and 60 % survival . mer ##s ‐ co ##v ins ##till ##ation ‐ in ##oc ##ulated mice exhibited clinical signs on day 1 , obvious lung lesions on days 3 ‐ 5 , continuous weight loss , 0 % survival by day 5 , and high viral loads in the lungs and brain on days 3 ‐ 5 . viral antigen and high levels of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es were detected in the aero ##sol and ins ##till ##ation groups . disease , lung les ##ion , and viral replication progression ##s were slower in the mer ##s ‐ co ##v aero ##sol ‐ infected mice than in the mer ##s ‐ co ##v ins ##till ##ation ‐ in ##oc ##ulated mice . conclusion : hd ##pp ##4 trans ##genic mice were successfully infected with mer ##s ‐ co ##v aero ##sol ##s via an animal nose ‐ only exposure device , and aero ##sol ‐ and ins ##till ##ation ‐ infected mice simulated the clinical symptoms of moderate diffuse inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia . however , the trans ##genic mice exposed to aero ##sol mer ##s ‐ co ##v developed disease and lung pathology progression ##s that more closely resembled those observed in humans .  
a ser ##ological survey of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was conducted among dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and herb ##ivo ##rous animals sharing the same past ##ura ##ge in ethiopia . the pseudo ##type ##d ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus coated with the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v was used in virus neutral ##ization ( v ##n ) tests performed in a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level ( bs ##l ) - 2 laboratory . the results were similar to those obtained from the v ##n test using live mer ##s - co ##v and were more sensitive than the elisa performed using synthetic mer ##s s ##1 fragment as the antigen as well as the competitive elisa performed using a mono ##cl ##onal antibody against mer ##s - co ##v . according to the comprehensive results of the four types of ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis methods , positive antibodies were detected only in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and the remaining herb ##ivo ##rous animals were not infected with the virus . moreover , using the present procedure , ser ##ological tests for mer ##s - co ##v can be conducted even in bs ##l 2 laboratory .  
in 2012 , an emerging viral infection was identified in saudi arabia that subsequently spread to 27 additional countries globally , though cases may have occurred elsewhere . the virus was ultimately named middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and has been endemic in saudi arabia since 2012 . as of september 2019 , 246 ##8 laboratory - confirmed cases with 85 ##1 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatal ##ity rate of 34 . 4 % , according to the world health organization . an imported case of mer ##s occurred in south korea in 2015 , stimulating a multi - month outbreak . several distinguishing factors emerge upon ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and sociological analysis of the two outbreak ##s including public awareness of the mer ##s outbreak , and transmission and sync ##hr ##oni ##zation of governing healthcare bodies . south korea implemented a string ##ent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information . in addition , many details about mer ##s - co ##v vi ##rol ##ogy , transmission , path ##ological progression , and even the reservoir , remain unknown . this paper aims to del ##ine ##ate the key differences between the two regional outbreak ##s from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices , information and public knowledge , cultural practices , and reservoirs , among others . further details about differing emergency outbreak responses , public information , and guidelines put in place to protect hospitals and citizens could improve the outcome of future mer ##s outbreak ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a severe respiratory disease associated with more than 246 ##8 human infections and over 85 ##1 deaths in 27 countries since 2012 . there are no approved treatments for mer ##s - co ##v infection although a combination of lo ##pina ##vir , ri ##ton ##avi ##r and inter ##fer ##on beta ( lp ##v / rt ##v - if ##nb ) is currently being evaluated in humans in the kingdom of saudi arabia . here , we show that re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( rd ##v ) and if ##nb have superior anti ##vira ##l activity to lp ##v and rt ##v in vitro . in mice , both prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic rd ##v improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology . in contrast , prop ##hyl ##actic lp ##v / rt ##v - if ##nb slightly reduces viral loads without impact ##ing other disease parameters . therapeutic lp ##v / rt ##v - if ##nb improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology . thus , we provide in vivo evidence of the potential for rd ##v to treat mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
in 2015 , we experienced the largest in - hospital middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak outside the arabian peninsula . we share the infection prevention measures for surgical procedures during the unexpected outbreak at our hospital . we reviewed all forms of related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers of our hospital . after the onset of outbreak , a multi ##dis ##ci ##plin ##ary team devised institutional mer ##s - control guidelines . two standard operating rooms were converted to temporary negative - pressure rooms by physically decreasing the in ##flow air volume ( − ##4 . 7 pa in the main room and − ##1 . 2 pa in the ant ##ero ##om ) . healthcare workers were equipped with standard or enhanced personal protective equipment according to the mer ##s - related patient ’ s profile and symptoms . six mer ##s - related patients underwent emergency surgery , including four mer ##s - exposed and two mer ##s - confirmed patients . negative conversion of mer ##s - co ##v polymer ##ase chain reaction tests was noticed for mer ##s - confirmed patients before surgery . mer ##s - exposed patients were also tested twice pre ##oper ##ative ##ly , all of which were negative . all operative procedures in mer ##s - related patients were performed without specific adverse events or per ##io ##per ##ative mer ##s transmission . our experience with setting up a temporary negative - pressure operation room and our conservative approach for managing mer ##s - related patients can be referred in cases of future unexpected mer ##s outbreak ##s in non - endemic countries .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) became a global human health threat since its first documentation in humans in 2012 . an efficient vaccine for the prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of humans in hot ##sp ##ots of the infection ( e . g . , saudi arabia ) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved . in this study , a chi ##meric dna construct was designed to en ##code an influenza a / h ##1 ##n ##1 na protein which is flanking im ##mun ##ogenic amino acids ( aa ) 73 ##6 – 76 ##1 of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . using the generated chi ##meric construct , a novel rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine strain against pan ##de ##mic influenza a virus ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 ) and mer ##s - co ##v was generated ( chi ##meric bi ##valent 5 + 3 ) . the chi ##meric bi ##valent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a rec ##om ##bina ##nt pr ##8 - based vaccine , expressing the p ##b ##1 , ha , and chi ##meric na of pan ##de ##mic 2009 h ##1 ##n ##1 . interesting ##ly , an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the pr ##8 - based 5 + 3 h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 vaccine strain that lacks the mer ##s - co ##v spike peptide insert . in bal ##b / c mice , the inactivated chi ##meric bi ##valent vaccine induced potent and specific neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v and h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 . this novel approach succeeded in developing a rec ##om ##bina ##nt influenza virus with potential use as a bi ##valent vaccine against h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 and mer ##s - co ##v . this approach provides a basis for the future development of chi ##meric influenza - based vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v and other viruses .  
bats are natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 demonstrates potential for cross - species transmission because its viral rna and specific antibodies have been detected in three bat species of taiwan . understanding the cell tr ##op ##ism of sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 is the first step for studying the mechanism of cross - species transmission . in this study , a lent ##iv ##irus - based pseudo ##virus was produced using the spike ( s ) protein of sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 or sar ##s - co ##v as a surface protein to test the interaction between corona ##vira ##l s protein and its cell receptor on 11 different cells . susceptible cells expressed red flu ##orescence protein ( rf ##p ) after the entry of rf ##p - bound green flu ##orescence protein ( g ##fp ) - fused s protein of sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 ( rf ##p - sc ##o - s - e ##gf ##p ) or rf ##p - sar ##s - s pseudo ##virus , and fire ##fly lucifer ##ase ( flu ##c ) activity expressed by cells infected with flu ##c - sc ##o - s - e ##gf ##p or flu ##c - sar ##s - s pseudo ##virus was quan ##ti ##fied . sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 pseudo ##virus had significantly higher entry e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies in mad ##in darby dog kidney ep ##ith ##elial cells ( md ##ck ) , black flying fox brain cells ( pa ##br ) , and rat small int ##est ##ine ep ##ith ##elial cells ( iec - 6 ) . sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus had significantly higher entry e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies in human embryo ##nic kidney ep ##ith ##elial cells ( he ##k - 293 ##t ) , pig kidney ep ##ith ##elial cells ( p ##k ##15 ) , and md ##ck cells . these findings demonstrated that sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v - 512 had a broad host range for cross - species transmission like sar ##s - co ##v .  
in recent years , tremendous efforts have been made in the engineering of bis ##pe ##ci ##fi ##c or multi - specific antibody - based therapeutic ##s by combining two or more functional antigen - recognizing elements into a single construct . however , to the best of our knowledge there has been no reported cases of effective anti ##vira ##l antibody - peptide bis ##pe ##ci ##fi ##c fusion proteins . we previously developed potent fully human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and inhibitor ##y peptide ##s against middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a novel corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory illness with high mortality . here , we describe the generation of antibody - peptide bis ##pe ##ci ##fi ##c fusion proteins , each of which contains an anti - mer ##s - co ##v single - chain antibody m3 ##36 ( or normal human i ##gg ##1 ch ##3 domain as a control ) linked with , or without , a mer ##s - co ##v fusion inhibitor ##y peptide hr ##2 ##p . we found that one of these fusion proteins , designated as m3 ##36 dia ##body - pep , exhibited more potent inhibitor ##y activity than the antibody or the peptide alone against pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v infection and mer ##s - co ##v s protein - mediated cell - cell fusion , suggesting its potential to be developed as an effective bis ##pe ##ci ##fi ##c im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##c for clinical use .  
so far , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the only known animal reservoir for middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . previous published ser ##ological studies showed that sera of ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s were all negative for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . however , a recent study revealed that direct in ##oc ##ulation of ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s intra ##nas ##ally with mer ##s - co ##v can lead to infection with abundant virus shed ##ding and ser ##oco ##n ##version . in this study , we examined the presence of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies in ba ##ct ##rian and hybrid camel ##s in dubai , the united arab emirates ( where dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are also present ) , and ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s in xinjiang , china ( where dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are absent ) . for the 29 serum samples from ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s in dubai tested by the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein - based enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( s - elisa ) and neutral ##ization antibody test , 14 ( 48 % ) and 12 ( 41 % ) , respectively , were positive for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . all the 12 serum samples that were positive with the neutral ##ization antibody test were also positive for the s - elisa . for the 11 sera from hybrid camel ##s in dubai tested with the s - elisa and neutral ##ization antibody test , 6 ( 55 % ) and 9 ( 82 % ) , respectively , were positive for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies . all the 6 serum samples that were positive for the s - elisa were also positive with the neutral ##ization antibody test . there was a strong correlation between the antibody levels detected by s - elisa and neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters , with a spear ##man coefficient of 0 . 62 ##6 ##2 ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 50 ##6 ##2 to 0 . 72 ##25 ) . all 92 ba ##ct ##rian camel serum samples from xinjiang were negative for mer ##s - co ##v antibodies tested using both s - elisa and the neutral ##ization antibody test . ba ##ct ##rian and hybrid camel ##s are potential sources of mer ##s - co ##v infection . importance since its first appearance in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) has affected > 25 countries , with > 2 , 400 cases and an extremely high fatal ##ity rate of > 30 % . the total number of mortal ##ities due to mer ##s is already greater than that due to severe acute respiratory syndrome . mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been confirmed to be
this study examined the effect of disc ##los ##ing a list of hospitals with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) patients on the number of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases in south korea . mer ##s - co ##v data from 20 may 2015 to 5 july 2015 were from the korean ministry of health & welfare website and analyzed using segment ##ed linear auto ##re ##gre ##ssi ##ve error models for interrupted time series . this study showed that the number of laboratory - confirmed cases was increased by 9 . 63 ##2 on 5 june ( p < 0 . 001 ) . however , this number was significantly decreased following disclosure of a list of hospitals with mer ##s - co ##v cases ( estimate = − ##0 . 69 ##9 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . disc ##los ##ing the list of hospitals exposed to mer ##s - co ##v was critical to the prevention of further infection . it reduced the number of confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases . thus , providing accurate and timely information is a key to critical care response .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection causes a spectrum of respiratory illness , from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to mild to fatal . mer ##s - co ##v is transmitted sporadic ##ally from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to humans and occasionally through human - to - human contact . current ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic evidence supports a major role in transmission for direct contact with live camel ##s or humans with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic mer ##s , but little evidence suggests the possibility of transmission from camel products or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s cases . because a proportion of case - patients do not report direct contact with camel ##s or with persons who have sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic mer ##s , further research is needed to con ##clusive ##ly determine additional mechanisms of transmission , to inform public health practice , and to ref ##ine current pre ##ca ##ution ##ary recommendations .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) of bat origin have caused two pan ##de ##mics in this century . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v both originated from bats , and it is highly likely that bat corona ##virus ##es will cause future outbreak ##s . active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mit ##igate the emergence of these viruses in humans . next - generation sequencing ( ng ##s ) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure un ##bia ##sed sequencing of bat co ##vs , considering their high genetic diversity . however , un ##bia ##sed ng ##s is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low - abundance co ##v sequences due to the high background level of non ##vira ##l sequences present in surveillance field samples . here , we employ a capture - based ng ##s approach using bait ##s targeting most of the co ##v species . using this technology , we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection . we discovered nine full genome ##s of bat co ##vs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them . importance active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mit ##igate the emergence of bat - origin co ##v in humans and livestock . however , great genetic diversity increases the chance of homo ##log ##ous rec ##om ##bina ##tion among co ##vs . performing targeted pc ##r , a common practice for many surveillance studies , would not reflect this diversity . ng ##s , on the other hand , is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low - abundance co ##v sequences . here , we employ a capture - based ng ##s approach using bait ##s targeting all co ##vs . our work demonstrates that targeted , cost - effective , large - scale , genome - level surveillance of bat co ##vs is now highly feasible .  
corona ##virus ( co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins are key for incorporating gen ##omic rna into pro ##geny viral particles . in infected cells , n proteins are present at the replication - transcription complexes ( rt ##cs ) , the sites of co ##v rna synthesis . it has been shown that n proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) , a commonly used model co ##v , interact ##s with non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 3 ( ns ##p ##3 ) , a component of the rt ##cs . these two aspects of the co ##v life cycle , however , have not been linked . we found that the m ##h ##v n protein binds exclusively to ns ##p ##3 and not other rt ##c components by using a systematic yeast two - hybrid approach , and we identified two distinct regions in the n protein that redundant ##ly media ##te this interaction . a selective n protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind ns ##p ##3 in vitro , resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to rt ##cs in vivo . furthermore , in contrast to the wild - type n protein , this n protein variant imp ##air ##s the stimulation of gen ##omic rna and viral mrna transcription in vivo and in vitro , which in turn leads to impairment of m ##h ##v replication and pro ##geny production . altogether , our results show that n protein recruitment to rt ##cs , via binding to ns ##p ##3 , is an essential step in the co ##v life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral rna synthesis . importance co ##vs have long been regarded as relatively harmless pathogen ##s for humans . severe respiratory tract infection outbreak ##s caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v , however , have caused high pathogen ##ici ##ty and mortality rates in humans . these outbreak ##s highlighted the relevance of being able to control co ##v infections . we used a model co ##v , m ##h ##v , to investigate the importance of the recruitment of n protein , a central component of co ##v vi ##rion ##s , to intra ##cellular platforms where co ##vs replicate , trans ##cr ##ibe , and translate their genome ##s . by identifying the principal binding partner at these intra ##cellular platforms and generating a specific mutant , we found that n protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral rna synthesis . moreover , blocking this recruitment strongly inhibit ##s viral infection . thus , our results explain an important aspect of the co ##v life cycle and reveal an interaction of viral proteins that could be targeted in anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a severe respiratory disease in humans . the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein media ##tes viral entry into target cells . for this , mer ##s - co ##v s engages the host cell protein dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 , cd ##26 ) and the interface between mer ##s - co ##v s and d ##pp ##4 has been resolved on the atomic level . here , we asked whether naturally - occurring poly ##morphism ##s in d ##pp ##4 , that alter amino acid residues required for mer ##s - co ##v s binding , influence cellular entry of mer ##s - co ##v . by screening of public databases , we identified fourteen such poly ##morphism ##s . introduction of the respective mutations into d ##pp ##4 revealed that all except one ( δ ##34 ##6 - 34 ##8 ) were compatible with robust d ##pp ##4 expression . four poly ##morphism ##s ( k ##26 ##7 ##e , k ##26 ##7 ##n , a2 ##9 ##1 ##p and δ ##34 ##6 - 34 ##8 ) strongly reduced binding of mer ##s - co ##v s to d ##pp ##4 and s protein - driven host cell entry , as determined using soluble s protein and s protein bearing r ##hab ##do ##vira ##l vectors , respectively . two poly ##morphism ##s ( k ##26 ##7 ##e and a2 ##9 ##1 ##p ) were analyzed in the context of authentic mer ##s - co ##v and were found to at ##ten ##uate viral replication . collectively , we identified naturally - occurring poly ##morphism ##s in d ##pp ##4 that negatively impact cellular entry of mer ##s - co ##v and might thus mod ##ulate mer ##s development in infected patients .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an acute , high - mortality - rate , severe infectious disease caused by an emerging mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) that causes severe respiratory diseases . the continuous spread and great pan ##de ##mic potential of mer ##s - co ##v make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines . we previously demonstrated that the application of gram - positive enhance ##r matrix ( gem ) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the mer ##s - co ##v receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) is a very promising mer ##s vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutral ##ization antibodies . we have also used the ra ##bies virus ( rv ) as a viral vector to design a rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine by expressing the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 ( spike ) protein on the surface of the rv . in this study , we compared the im ##mun ##ological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in bal ##b / c mice in terms of the levels of humor ##al and cellular immune responses . the results show that the ra ##bies virus vector - based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the gem particles vector . however , the gem particles vector - based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response , even at a very low dose of 1 µ ##g . these results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humor ##al and cellular immune responses in the same animal model . this discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development , but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogen ##s .  
traditionally , the emergence of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host . our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like viruses argued that bats already harbor co ##vs with the ability to in ##fect humans without adaptation . these results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoo ##not ##ic co ##v . in this work , we describe overcoming host restriction of two middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - like bat co ##vs using ex ##ogen ##ous pro ##tea ##se treatment . we found that the spike protein of pdf ##21 ##80 - co ##v , a mer ##s - like virus found in a uganda ##n bat , could media ##te infection of ve ##ro and human cells in the presence of ex ##ogen ##ous try ##ps ##in . we subsequently show that the bat virus spike can media ##te the infection of human gut cells but is unable to in ##fect human lung cells . using receptor - blocking antibodies , we show that infection with the pdf ##21 ##80 spike does not require mer ##s - co ##v receptor d ##pp ##4 and antibodies developed against the mer ##s spike receptor - binding domain and s ##2 portion are ineffective in neutral ##izing the pdf ##21 ##80 chi ##mer ##a . finally , we found that the addition of ex ##ogen ##ous try ##ps ##in also rescues hk ##u ##5 - co ##v , a second bat group 2 ##c co ##v . together , these results indicate that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the spike , not receptor binding , is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2 ##c co ##vs . coupled with receptor binding , pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat co ##vs and offers a means to recover previously un ##re ##co ##vera ##ble zoo ##not ##ic co ##v strains . importance overall , our studies demonstrate that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es . moving forward , the results argue that both receptor binding and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es . in addition , the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously un ##cu ##lt ##iva ##ble zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus strains and argue that other tissues , including the digest ##ive tract , could be a site for future corona ##virus emergence events in humans .  
continued reports of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in ##fect ##ing humans have occurred since the identification of this virus in 2012 . mer ##s - co ##v is prone to cause endemic disease in the middle east , with several dozen spill ##over infections to other continents . it is h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that mer ##s - co ##v originated from bat corona ##virus ##es and that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are its natural reservoir . although gene segments identical to mer ##s - co ##v were sequence ##d from certain species of bats and one species experimental ##ly shed the virus , it is still unknown whether other bats can transmit the virus . here , at the molecular level , we found that all pu ##rified bat cd ##26 ##s ( bc ##d ##26 ##s ) from a diverse range of species interact with the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v , with equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant values ranging from several to hundreds at the micro ##mo ##lar level . moreover , all bc ##d ##26 ##s expressed in this study mediated the entry of pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v to receptor - expressing cells , indicating the broad potential engagement of bc ##d ##26 ##s as mer ##s - co ##v receptors . further structural analysis indicated that in the bat receptor , compared to the human receptor , substitution ##s of key residues and their adjacent amino acids leads to decreased binding affinity to the mer ##s - rb ##d . these results add more evidence to the existing belief that bats are the original source of mer ##s - co ##v and suggest that bc ##d ##26 ##s in many species can media ##te the entry of the virus , which has significant implications for the surveillance and control of mer ##s - co ##v infection . importance in this study , we found that bat cd ##26 ##s ( bc ##d ##26 ##s ) from different species exhibit large divers ##ities , especially in the region responsible for binding to the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . however , they maintain the interaction with mer ##s - rb ##d at varied af ##fin ##ities and support the entry of pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v . these bat receptors poly ##morphism ##s seem to con ##fer evolutionary pressure for the adaptation of cd ##26 - binding virus , such as the ancestor of mer ##s - co ##v , and led to the generation of diversified cd ##26 - engaging co ##v strains . thus , our data add more evidence to support that bats are the reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v and similar viruses , as well as further emphasize the necessity to survey mer ##s - co ##v and
this study investigated the co ‐ local ##ization of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) and its receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e ‐ 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry ( i ##hc ) across respiratory and l ##ym ##ph ##oid organs of experimental ##ly mer ##s ‐ co ##v infected pigs and ll ##ama ##s . also , scanning electron microscopy was performed to assess the ci ##lia ##ry integrity of respiratory ep ##ith ##elial cells in both species . in pigs , on day 2 post ‐ in ##oc ##ulation ( p . i . ) , d ##pp ##4 ‐ mer ##s ‐ co ##v co ‐ local ##ization was detected in medial tu ##rbin ##ate ep ##ith ##eli ##um . on day 4 p . i . , the virus / receptor co ‐ localized in frontal and medial tu ##rbin ##ate ep ##ith ##elial cells in pigs , and ep ##ith ##elial cells distributed uneven ##ly through the whole nasal cavity and in the cervical l ##ym ##ph node in ll ##ama ##s . mer ##s ‐ co ##v viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id was mainly detected in upper respiratory tract sites on days 2 and 4 p . i . in pigs and day 4 p . i . in ll ##ama ##s . no mer ##s ‐ co ##v was detected on day 24 p . i . in any tissue by i ##hc . while pigs showed severe ci ##lia ##ry loss in the nasal mu ##cos ##a both on days 2 and 4 p . i . and moderate loss in the tr ##ache ##a on days 4 and 24 p . i . , ci ##lia ##tion of respiratory organs in ll ##ama ##s was not significantly affected . obtained data confirm the role of d ##pp ##4 for mer ##s ‐ co ##v entry in respiratory ep ##ith ##elial cells of ll ##ama ##s . notably , several nasal ep ##ith ##elial cells in pigs were found to express viral antigen but not d ##pp ##4 , suggesting the possible existence of other molecule / s facilitating virus entry or down regulation of d ##pp ##4 upon infection .  
introduction . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus was first recognized in september 2012 in saudi arabia . the clinical presentations of mer ##s and non - mer ##s sar ##i are often similar . therefore , the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of mer ##s - co ##v is essential . however , the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers . the nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in saudi arabia , and hence , this study aims to identify them . methods : it was a surveillance system - based study , for which data from a total of 23 , 64 ##6 suspected patients in ri ##yad ##h and al q ##ass ##im regions were analyzed from january 2017 until december 2017 to estimate the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis . results : of 23 , 64 ##6 suspected cases , 119 ( 0 . 5 % ) were confirmed by laboratory results . these confirmed cases ( 67 . 2 % of which were males ) had a mean age of 43 . 23 years ( sd ± 22 . 8 ) . around 42 . 2 % of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47 % of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer . the study identified three significant and independent predict ##ors for confirmation of the disease : an age between 41 and 60 years , male gender , and summer season admission . conclusion : the study provides evidence that the mer ##s - co ##v epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a con ##tag ##ious disease . future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of saudi arabia as well and explore potential prevent ##able risk factors .  
sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) , a newly discovered enter ##ic corona ##virus , is the ae ##ti ##ological agent that causes severe clinical dia ##rr ##hea and int ##estinal path ##ological damage in pig ##lets . to understand the effect of sad ##s - co ##v on host cells , we characterized the ap ##op ##to ##tic pathways and el ##uc ##ida ##ted mechanisms underlying the process of ap ##op ##to ##tic cell death after sad ##s - co ##v infection . sad ##s - co ##v - infected cells showed evidence of ap ##op ##tosis in vitro and in vivo . the use of a pan - cas ##pas ##e inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of sad ##s - co ##v - induced ap ##op ##tosis and reduction in sad ##s - co ##v replication , suggest ##ive of the association of a cas ##pas ##e - dependent pathway . furthermore , sad ##s - co ##v infection activated the in ##itia ##tors cas ##pas ##e - 8 and - 9 and up ##re ##gul ##ated fa ##sl and bid cleavage , demonstrating a cross ##talk between the ex ##tri ##ns ##ic and intrinsic pathways . however , the pro ##ap ##op ##to ##tic proteins ba ##x and cy ##to ##chrome c ( cy ##t c ) re ##lo ##cal ##ized to the mit ##och ##ond ##ria and cy ##top ##las ##m , respectively , after infection by sad ##s - co ##v . moreover , ve ##ro e ##6 and ip ##i - 2 ##i cells treated with cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a ( csa ) , an inhibitor of mitochondrial per ##me ##ability transition por ##e ( mp ##tp ) opening , were completely protected from sad ##s - co ##v - induced ap ##op ##tosis and viral replication , suggesting the involvement of cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in d ( cy ##pd ) in these processes . altogether , our results indicate that cas ##pas ##e - dependent fa ##sl ( ex ##tri ##ns ##ic ) - and mit ##och ##ond ##ria ( intrinsic ) - mediated ap ##op ##to ##tic pathways play a central role in sad ##s - co ##v - induced ap ##op ##tosis that facilitates viral replication . in summary , these findings demonstrate mechanisms by which sad ##s - co ##v induce ##s ap ##op ##tosis and improve our understanding of sad ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) , including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov , also known as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , lead global epidemic ##s with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . however , there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019 - nc ##ov / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing , representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs , could short ##en the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery . in this study , we present an int ##eg ##rative , anti ##vira ##l drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing methodology implementing a systems ph ##arm ##aco ##logy - based network medicine platform , quan ##tify ##ing the inter ##play between the hc ##ov – host interact ##ome and drug targets in the human protein – protein interaction network . phylogenetic analyses of 15 hc ##ov whole genome ##s reveal that 2019 - nc ##ov / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 shares the highest nu ##cle ##otide sequence identity with sar ##s - co ##v ( 79 . 7 % ) . specifically , the envelope and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins of 2019 - nc ##ov / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are two evolution ##ari ##ly conserved regions , having the sequence identities of 96 % and 89 . 6 % , respectively , compared to sar ##s - co ##v . using network proximity analyses of drug targets and hc ##ov – host interactions in the human interact ##ome , we prior ##iti ##ze 16 potential anti - hc ##ov rep ##ur ##po ##sable drugs ( e . g . , mel ##aton ##in , mer ##cap ##top ##uri ##ne , and sir ##oli ##mus ) that are further valid ##ated by enrichment analyses of drug - gene signatures and hc ##ov - induced transcript ##omics data in human cell lines . we further identify three potential drug combinations ( e . g . , sir ##oli ##mus plus da ##ct ##ino ##my ##cin , mer ##cap ##top ##uri ##ne plus mel ##aton ##in , and tore ##mi ##fen ##e plus em ##od ##in ) captured by the “ complementary exposure ” pattern : the targets of the drugs both hit the hc ##ov – host sub ##net ##work , but target separate neighborhoods in the human interact ##ome network . in summary , this study offers powerful network - based method ##ologies for rapid identification of candidate rep ##ur ##po ##sable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019 - nc ##ov / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
[ image : see text ] severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and has the potential to threaten global public health and socio ##economic stability . evidence of antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) of sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro and in non - human primate ##s clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine . using antibodies from sar ##s patients , we identified and characterized sar ##s - co ##v b - cell peptide ep ##ito ##pes with di ##spar ##ate functions . in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues , the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein peptide ##s s ( 47 ##1 – 50 ##3 ) , s ( 60 ##4 – 625 ) , and s ( 116 ##4 – 119 ##1 ) eli ##cite ##d antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non - human primate ##s . in contrast , peptide s ( 59 ##7 – 60 ##3 ) induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non - human primate ##s by using an ep ##ito ##pe sequence - dependent ( es ##d ) mechanism . this peptide exhibited a high level of ser ##ological react ##ivity ( 64 % ) , which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem ep ##ito ##pes ( s ( 59 ##7 – 60 ##3 ) and s ( 60 ##4 – 625 ) ) and a long - term human b - cell memory response with anti ##ser ##a from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients . thus , peptide - based vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v could be engineered to avoid ad ##e via elimination of the s ( 59 ##7 – 60 ##3 ) ep ##ito ##pe . we provide here ##in an alternative strategy to prepare a safe and effective vaccine for ad ##e of viral infection by identifying and eliminating ep ##ito ##pe sequence - dependent enhancement of viral infection .  
[ image : see text ] the suggested bat origin for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has rev ##ital ##ized the studies of other bat - derived corona ##virus ##es with respect to inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission potential . bat corona ##virus ( bat ##co ##v ) hk ##u ##9 is an important beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( beta ##co ##v ) that is phylogenetic ##ally affiliated with the same genus as mer ##s - co ##v . the bat surveillance data indicated that bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##9 has been widely spreading and circulating in bats . this highlights the necessity of character ##izing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers . the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the corona ##virus spike ( s ) protein recognizes host receptors to media ##te virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining the viral tr ##op ##ism and transmission capacity . in this study , the put ##ative s rb ##d of bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##9 ( hk ##u ##9 - rb ##d ) , which is homo ##log ##ous to other beta ##co ##v rb ##ds that have been structurally and functional ##ly defined , was characterized via a series of bio ##physical and crystal ##log ##raphic methods . by using surface pl ##as ##mon resonance , we demonstrated that hk ##u ##9 - rb ##d binds to neither sar ##s - co ##v receptor ace ##2 nor mer ##s - co ##v receptor cd ##26 . we further determined the atomic structure of hk ##u ##9 - rb ##d , which as expected is composed of a core and an external sub ##dom ##ain . the core sub ##dom ##ain fold resembles those of other beta ##co ##v rb ##ds , whereas the external sub ##dom ##ain is structurally unique with a single helix , explaining the inability of hk ##u ##9 - rb ##d to react with either ace ##2 or cd ##26 . via comparison of the available rb ##d structures , we further proposed a homo ##log ##ous inter ##su ##b ##dom ##ain binding mode in beta ##co ##v rb ##ds that anchors the external sub ##dom ##ain to the core sub ##dom ##ain . the revealed rb ##d features would shed light on the evolution route of beta ##co ##v .  
[ image : see text ] severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a newly emerged corona ##virus that infected more than 800 ##0 individuals and resulted in more than 800 ( 10 – 15 % ) fatalities in 2003 . the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s has been identified as a novel human corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and its viral pro ##tea ##se , sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) , has been shown to be essential for replication and has hence been recognized as a potent drug target for sar ##s infection . currently , there is no effective treatment for this epidemic despite the intensive research that has been undertaken since 2003 ( over 350 ##0 publications ) . this perspective focuses on the status of various e ##ffi ##ca ##cious anti - sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) che ##mot ##her ##ap ##ies discovered during the last 12 years ( 2003 – 2015 ) from all sources , including laboratory synthetic methods , natural products , and virtual screening . we describe here mainly pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic and small molecule inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . attempts have been made to provide a complete description of the structural features and binding modes of these inhibitors under many conditions .  
aim : we report the diagnostic evaluation of a confirm ##atory reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) kit targeting the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) n gene . material & methods : 33 patient samples from two collections sites in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , which were pre - characterized via real - time rt - pc ##r targeting mer ##s - co ##v or ##f ##1 ##a and up ##e , and were tested using the mer ##s - co ##v n gene , as a confirm ##atory ass ##ay . this diagnostic procedure follows a two - step diagnostic ##s scheme , recommended by the who . results : 18 / 33 samples tested positive , 11 / 33 tested negative for mer ##s - co ##v rna and 2 / 33 showed uncertain results . conclusion : the results suggest , that the real ##star ( ® ) mer ##s - co ##v ( n gene ) rt - pc ##r kit 1 . 0 can be considered a suitable and reliable confirm ##atory ass ##ay in combination with the real ##star mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r kit 1 . 0 according to the diagnostic scheme recommended by who .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein alone can media ##te the membrane fusion required for virus entry and cell fusion . it is also a major im ##mun ##ogen and a target for entry inhibitors . recent rapid advances in our knowledge of the structure and function of this protein have lead to the development of a number of candidate vaccine im ##mun ##ogen ##s and sar ##s - co ##v entry inhibitors .  
ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ( ace ) and ace ##2 are highly homo ##log ##ous metal ##lo ##pro ##tea ##ses that provide essential catalytic functions in the ren ##in - ang ##iot ##ens ##in system ( ras ) . ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii is one key effect ##or peptide of the ras , inducing va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tion and ex ##ert ##ing multiple biological functions . ace cl ##ea ##ves ang ##iot ##ens ##in i to generate ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii , whereas ace ##2 reduces ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii levels . acc ##um ##ulating evidence has demonstrated a physiological and path ##ological role of ace ##2 in the cardiovascular systems . intriguing ##ly , the sar ##s corona ##virus , the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , utilizes ace ##2 as an essential receptor for cell fusion and in vivo infections . moreover , recent studies have demonstrated that ace ##2 protects mu ##rine lungs from acute lung injury as well as sar ##s - spike protein - mediated lung injury , suggesting a dual role of ace ##2 in sar ##s infections and protection from ar ##ds .  
cellular entry of enveloped viruses is often dependent on attachment proteins expressed on the host cell surface . viral envelope proteins bind these receptors , and , in an incomplete ##ly understood process , facilitate fusion of the cellular and viral membranes so as to introduce the viral core into the cy ##top ##las ##m . only a small fraction of viral receptors have been identified so far . recently , a novel corona ##virus was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the fusion protein gene of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was clone ##d and characterized , and shortly thereafter , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) was shown to be its functional receptor . identification of ace ##2 as a receptor for sar ##s - co ##v will likely contribute to the development of anti ##vira ##ls and vaccines . it may also contribute to the development of additional animal models for studying sar ##s pathogen ##esis , and could help identify the animal reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v .  
ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , a second ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ( ace ) , regulates the ren ##in – ang ##iot ##ens ##in system by counter ##bala ##nc ##ing ace activity . acc ##um ##ulating evidence in recent years has demonstrated a physiological and path ##ological role of ace ##2 in the cardiovascular systems . recently , it has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus , the cause of sar ##s , utilizes ace ##2 as an essential receptor for cell fusion and in vivo infections in mice . intriguing ##ly , ace ##2 acts as a protective factor in various experimental models of acute lung failure and , therefore , acts not only as a key deter ##mina ##nt for sar ##s virus entry into cells but also contributes to sar ##s pathogen ##esis . here we review the role of ace ##2 in disease pathogen ##esis , including lung diseases and cardiovascular diseases .  
to identify a model for the study of int ##estinal pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) we tested the sensitivity of six human int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cell lines to infection with sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in per ##missive cell lines , effects of sar ##s - co ##v on cellular gene expression were anal ##yse ##d using high - density ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide arrays . ca ##co - 2 and cl - 14 cell lines were found to be highly per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v , due to the presence of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 as a functional receptor . in both cell lines , sar ##s - co ##v infection der ##eg ##ulated expression of cellular genes which may be important for the int ##estinal pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) can be divided into low pathogen ##ic and highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es . the low pathogen ##ic co ##vs in ##fect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild , cold - like respiratory illness . in contrast , highly pathogen ##ic hc ##ov ##s such as severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) predominantly in ##fect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia . severe pneumonia caused by pathogen ##ic hc ##ov ##s is often associated with rapid virus replication , massive inflammatory cell in ##filtration and elevated pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine / che ##mo ##kin ##e responses resulting in acute lung injury ( ali ) , and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) . recent studies in experimental ##ly infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus - induced im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ological events in causing fatal pneumonia after hc ##ov infections . here we review the current understanding of how a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated immune response may cause lung im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology leading to del ##eter ##ious clinical manifestation ##s after pathogen ##ic hc ##ov infections .  
the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of sar ##s and the development of vaccines . it was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli as a fusion with human g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase ( h ##gs ##t ) and was confirmed by western b ##lot ##ting analysis . this rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein ( h ##gs ##t - n ) was pu ##rified and used to measure the sar ##s - co ##v n - specific antibody in the sera of eight sar ##s patients by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . specific antibody response to this pu ##rified rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein was 100 % positive in the sar ##s patients ’ sera , while none of the control sera from 30 healthy people gave a positive reaction in the same ass ##ay . the sar ##s - co ##v n protein was also expressed in lac ##to ##co ##ccus lac ##tis in the cy ##top ##las ##m or secret ##ed into the medium . the n - producing strain mg ##13 ##6 ##3 / ps ##ec ##n and the pu ##rified h ##gs ##t - n protein were respectively administered to mice , either oral ##ly or intra ##nas ##ally . results indicated that oral ##ly delivered mg ##13 ##6 ##3 / ps ##ec ##n induced significant n - specific i ##gg in the sera . in conclusion , our work provides a novel strategy to produce the sar ##s - co ##v n protein for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis and for l . lac ##tis - based mu ##cos ##al vaccines .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , sar ##s - co ##v . in previous studies , we showed that a sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein - based modified va ##cci ##nia ankara ( mv ##a - s ) vaccine could induce strong neutral ##izing antibody ( na ##b ) response which might have played a critical role in protecting chinese r ##hes ##us monkeys from the pathogen ##ic viral challenge . to date , however , it remains unknown what the minimal level of na ##b is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans . it is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of na ##b response in vivo . here , we evaluate various va ##cci ##nation regime ##ns using combinations of dna - s , mv ##a - s , and aden ##ov ##irus type 5 ( ad ##5 - s ) vaccines . we show that in va ##cci ##nated mice and rabbits , a het ##ero ##log ##ous mv ##a - s prime with ad ##5 - s boost regime ##n induce ##s the highest and most persistent level of na ##b response when compared with other combinations . interesting ##ly , the initial level of na ##b after prime does not necessarily predict the magnitude of the secondary response after the boost . thus , our data provides a promising optimal regime ##n for vaccine development in humans against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
background : there are six human pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) , which mainly cause infections of the respiratory system . in everyday clinical practice , it is helpful to know the relevance and characteristics of these pathogen ##s . objective : to present the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical picture and differences of human pathogen ##ic co ##v and to provide information on the diagnostic ##s and treatment of patients suspected of having co ##v infections . material and methods : selective literature search , presentation of results and discussion of fundamental works and expert recommendations , including publications by the world health organization ( who ) , the european centre for disease prevention and control ( ec ##dc ) and the robert koch institute . results : the four endemic human co ##vs ( hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 ) mainly cause mild respiratory tract infections . in addition to these four endemic hc ##ov , the two epidemic co ##v , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v can cause severe pneumonia . the sar ##s - co ##v has not been detected in humans in the last 15 years and mer ##s - co ##v has been circulating mainly on the arabian peninsula since 2012 ; however , neither a specific treatment nor approved vaccines exist for any of the six human pathogen ##ic co ##vs . conclusion : all six human co ##vs can be diagnosed using rt - pc ##r on respiratory specimens but this is rarely necessary for the four endemic strains . in current clinical practice sar ##s - co ##v has no importance as it has not been detected in humans for 15 years ; however , a possible mer ##s - co ##v infection should be taken into account in patients with typical symptoms and travel history to endemic regions . in this case , rapid diagnostic and general hygiene practices are important to prevent further transmission .  
the sudden appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 demonstrated to the world at large that despite the high standard of medical care in affected countries , a highly con ##tag ##ious emerging infectious disease could spread rapidly worldwide . by application and improvement of string ##ent infection control measures , a further spread of sar ##s could be stopped and the disease could so far be defeated . in the meantime , decisive progress in the knowledge about the structure and further characteristics of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) have been made , including the likely virus reservoir and the ways of spread . valid ##ated diagnostic tests are now available and are further being improved . effective vaccines and anti ##vira ##l agents are being developed . of imminent importance to prepare against a resurgence of sar ##s , remain , besides an exact knowledge about the viral pathogen and its possible further behavior , constant vi ##gil ##ance , early recognition , and instant isolation of suspected cases of sar ##s .  
the emergence of the new sar ##s corona ##virus has shown dramatically the high relevance of human corona ##virus infections . this overview presents data of both ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical studies of this new virus infection . moreover , details of research on the pathogen ##esis , diagnostic ##s , and therapy are given . the recent infections in december 2003 clearly document that sar ##s will be a major topic also in 2004 .  
recently , a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has emerged from wu ##han , china , causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . since the sar ##s - co ##v outbreak in 2002 , extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic - level interactions between the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) and its host receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which regulate both the cross - species and human - to - human transmissions of sar ##s - co ##v . here , we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019 - nc ##ov , based on the rich knowledge about sar ##s - co ##v and the newly released sequence of 2019 - nc ##ov . first , the sequence of 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d , including its receptor - binding motif ( rb ##m ) that directly contacts ace ##2 , is similar to that of sar ##s - co ##v , strongly suggesting that 2019 - nc ##ov uses ace ##2 as its receptor . second , several critical residues in 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##m ( particularly g ##ln ##49 ##3 ) provide favorable interactions with human ace ##2 , consistent with 2019 - nc ##ov ’ s capacity for human cell infection . third , several other critical residues in 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##m ( particularly as ##n ##50 ##1 ) are compatible with , but not ideal for , binding human ace ##2 , suggesting that 2019 - nc ##ov has acquired some capacity for human - to - human transmission . last , while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019 - nc ##ov , 2019 - nc ##ov also potentially recognizes ace ##2 from a diversity of animal species ( except mice and rats ) , imp ##lica ##ting these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019 - nc ##ov infections . these analyses provide insights into the receptor usage , cell entry , host cell in ##fect ##ivity and animal origin of 2019 - nc ##ov and may help epidemic surveillance and prevent ##ive measures against 2019 - nc ##ov . importance the recent emergence of wu ##han corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) puts the world on alert . 2019 - nc ##ov is reminiscent of the sar ##s - co ##v outbreak in 2002 to 2003 . our decade - long structural studies on the receptor recognition by sar ##s - co ##v have identified key interactions between sar ##s - co ##v spike protein and its host receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which regulate both the cross - species and human - to - human transmissions of sar ##s - co ##v . one of the goals of sar ##s
the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) from the hub ##ei province in china in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of corona ##virus ##es . the rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months highlights the trans ##mis ##sibility of this family of viruses and the significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality that they can cause . we highlight the current state of knowledge of corona ##virus biology while answering questions concerning the current outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the discovery of sar ##s - like corona ##virus in bats suggests that bats could be the natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v . however , previous studies indicated the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) protein , a known sar ##s - co ##v receptor , from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . here , we extended our previous study to ace ##2 molecules from seven additional bat species and tested their interactions with human sar ##s - co ##v spike protein using both hiv - based pseudo ##type and live sar ##s - co ##v infection ass ##ays . the results show that ace ##2 ##s of my ##ot ##is da ##ub ##ent ##oni and rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus support viral entry mediated by the sar ##s - co ##v s protein , albeit with different efficiency in comparison to that of the human ace ##2 . further , the alteration of several key residues either decreased or enhanced bat ace ##2 receptor efficiency , as predicted from a structural modeling study of the different bat ace ##2 molecules . these data suggest that m . da ##ub ##ent ##oni and r . sin ##icus are likely to be susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v and may be candidates as the natural host of the sar ##s - co ##v pro ##gen ##itor viruses . furthermore , our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ace ##2 among bats is greater than that observed among known sar ##s - co ##v susceptible mammals , highlighting the possibility that there are many more un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized bat species that can act as a reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v or its pro ##gen ##itor viruses . this calls for continuation and expansion of field surveillance studies among different bat populations to eventually identify the true natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##00 ##70 ##5 - 01 ##0 - 07 ##29 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerged , highly pathogen ##ic agent that caused over 8 , 000 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between november 2002 and september 2003 . while direct person - to - person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases , other modes have not been ruled out . fae ##cal shed ##ding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in hong kong . we studied the stability of sar ##s - co ##v under different conditions , both in suspension and dried on surfaces , in comparison with other human - pathogen ##ic viruses , including human corona ##virus hc ##ov - 229 ##e . in suspension , hc ##ov - 229 ##e gradually lost its in ##fect ##ivity completely while sar ##s - co ##v retained its in ##fect ##ivity for up to 9 days ; in the dried state , survival times were 24 h versus 6 days . thermal ina ##ct ##ivation at 56 ##° ##c was highly effective in the absence of protein , reducing the virus ti ##tre to below detect ##ability ; however , the addition of 20 % protein ex ##erted a protective effect resulting in residual in ##fect ##ivity . if protein - containing solutions are to be inactivated , heat treatment at 60 ##° ##c for at least 30 min must be used . different fix ##ation procedures , e . g . for the preparation of im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence slides , as well as chemical means of virus ina ##ct ##ivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective . our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for sar ##s patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on sar ##s - co ##v safely . nevertheless , the agent ’ s ten ##ac ##ity is considerably higher than that of hc ##ov - 229 ##e , and should sar ##s re - emerge , increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene .  
the observations that l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia is common in severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) patients and that peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cell ( p ##bm ##c ) could be infected by sar ##s - co ##v indicate that p ##bm ##c could be useful in identifying the gene expression profile in con ##vale ##scent patients and tracing the host response to sar ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , the altered genes expressions in the p ##bm ##c of con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients were investigated with suppression sub ##tra ##ctive hybrid ##ization ( ss ##h ) . we found that genes encoded by mitochondrial dna ( mt ##dna ) were obviously up ##re ##gul ##ated , while mit ##och ##ond ##ria were now found to be closely connected with anti ##vira ##l immunity . the identification of a viral gene , m , in ss ##h cd ##na library shows the long - term existence of sar ##s - co ##v in vivo . in addition , some ox ##ida ##tive stress sensitive genes , heat shock proteins , transcription factors , and cy ##tok ##ines showed remarkable elevation . thin - section electron microscope shows increased l ##ys ##oso ##me - like gran ##ule and mit ##och ##ond ##ria in p ##bm ##c of patients . these results provide important intra ##cellular clue for tracing host response to sar ##s - co ##v infection and suggest a role of mit ##och ##ond ##ria in that process .  
phylogenetic trees constructed using predicted amino acid sequences of put ##ative proteins of corona ##virus hk ##u ##1 ( co ##v - hk ##u ##1 ) revealed that co ##v - hk ##u ##1 formed a distinct branch among group 2 corona ##virus ##es . of the 14 trees from p ##65 to ns ##p ##10 , nine showed that co ##v - hk ##u ##1 was clustered with mu ##rine hepatitis virus . from ns ##p ##11 , the top ##ologies of the trees changed dramatically . for the eight trees from ns ##p ##11 to n , seven showed that the co ##v - hk ##u ##1 branch was the first branch . the cod ##on usage patterns of co ##v - hk ##u ##1 differed significantly from those in other group 2 corona ##virus ##es . split decomposition analysis revealed that rec ##om ##bina ##tion events had occurred between co ##v - hk ##u ##1 and other corona ##virus ##es .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( co - v ) contains a single spike ( s ) protein , which binds to a receptor molecule , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ; also known as cd ##26 ) , and serves as a neutral ##izing antigen . pseudo ##type ##d viruses are useful for measuring neutral ##ization ti ##ters against highly infectious viruses as well as for studying their mechanism of entry . in this study , we constructed a series of cy ##top ##las ##mic del ##eti ##on mutants of mer ##s - co ##v s and compared the efficiency with which they formed pseudo ##type ##s with ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus . a pseudo ##type bearing an s protein with the c - terminal 16 amino acids deleted ( mer ##sp ##v - st ##16 ) reached a maximum ti ##ter that was approximately ten ##fold higher than that of a pseudo ##type bearing a non - truncated full - length s protein . using mer ##sp ##v - st ##16 , we demonstrated the inability of rat d ##pp ##4 to serve as a functional receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , suggesting that rats are not susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v infection . this study provides novel information that enhance ##s our understanding of the host range of mer ##s - co ##v . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##00 ##70 ##5 - 01 ##5 - 250 ##6 - z ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes a lung disease with high mortality . in addition , os ##te ##one ##cr ##osis and bone abnormalities with reduced bone density have been observed in patients following recovery from sar ##s , which were partly but not entirely explained by the short - term use of ste ##roids . here , we demonstrate that human mono ##cytes , potential precursor ##s of os ##te ##oc ##las ##ts , partly express ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , a cellular receptor of sar ##s - co ##v , and that expression of an accessory protein of sar ##s - co ##v , 3a / x ##1 , in mu ##rine macro ##pha ##ge cell line raw ##26 ##4 . 7 cells , enhanced n ##f - κ ##b activity and differentiation into os ##te ##oc ##las ##t - like cells in the presence of receptor act ##iva ##tor of n ##f - κ ##b ligand ( rank ##l ) . furthermore , human ep ##ith ##elial a ##54 ##9 cells expressed ace ##2 , and expression of 3a / x ##1 in these cells up - regulated tn ##f - α , which is known to accelerate os ##te ##oc ##las ##to ##genesis . 3a / x ##1 also enhanced rank ##l expression in mouse st ##rom ##al st ##2 cells . these findings indicate that sar ##s - co ##v 3a / x ##1 might promote os ##te ##oc ##las ##to ##genesis by direct and indirect mechanisms .  
different tree - building methods consistently place the sar ##s corona - virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) as a basal group 2 corona ##virus rather than as an un ##group ##ed species as concluded by others . detailed comparisons of the sar ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequence with those of six other corona ##virus ##es failed to find evidence of rec ##om ##bina ##tion or gen ##omic rear ##rang ##ement using computational methods designed for that purpose .  
in order to define and character ##ize target cells of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) we studied the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of 23 different permanent and primary eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cell lines to sar ##s - corona ##virus . beneath ve ##ro e ##6 cells sar ##s - corona ##virus infection could also be demonstrated in two pig cell lines ( poe ##k , ps ) and one human cell line ( huh - 7 ) using the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay and a newly established quantitative real - time pc ##r . in all susceptible cell lines mrna of the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v infection , could be detected by rt - pc ##r . our results show that there is a correlation between the abundance of ace ##2 mrna and sar ##s - co ##v su ##sc ##ept ##ibility .  
patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) may present with extra - pulmonary symptoms . we report a 16 - year - old adolescent with sar ##s who presented with dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . treatment directed against sar ##s was prompted by an ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link and the clinical picture as the disease evolved . this at ##yp ##ical presentation posed a diagnostic challenge for physicians . conclusion : proper disposal of patient ex ##cre ##ta is important to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome .  
bats have been shown to serve as natural reservoirs for numerous emerging viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in the present study , we report the discovery of bat co ##v genes in indonesian mo ##lu ##cca ##n naked - backed fruit bats ( dobson ##ia mo ##lu ##cc ##ensis ) . a partial rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase gene sequence was detected in fe ##ces and tissues samples from the fruit bats , and the region between the rd ##rp and he ##lica ##se genes could also be amplified from fe ##cal samples . phylogenetic analysis suggested that these bat co ##vs are related to members of the genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus .  
human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) is a respiratory virus that usually causes a common cold . however , it has the potential to cause severe infection in young children and im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised adults . both sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses . however , the ability of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 to ant ##ago ##nis ##e the intra ##cellular anti ##vira ##l defences has not yet been investigated . the potential role of the hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 structural ( m and n ) and accessory proteins ( ns ##2 ##a and ns ##5 ##a ) in the alteration of anti ##vira ##l gene expression was investigated in this study . hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ##m , n , ns ##2 ##a and ns ##5 ##a proteins were expressed in human embryo ##nic kidney 293 ( he ##k - 293 ) cells before challenge with send ##ai virus . the human anti ##vira ##l response pc ##r array was used to profile the anti ##vira ##l gene expression in he ##k - 293 cells . over 30 genes were down ##re ##gul ##ated in the presence of one of the hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 proteins , e . g . genes representing mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ##s , toll - like receptors , inter ##fer ##ons , inter ##le ##uki ##ns , and signaling trans ##duction proteins . our findings suggest that similarly to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 has the ability to down ##re ##gul ##ate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different anti ##vira ##l signaling pathways . further studies are needed to confirm the role of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 structural and accessory proteins in ant ##ago ##nis ##ing anti ##vira ##l gene expression .  
in 2012 , a novel human corona ##virus emerged and was tentatively named “ middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ” ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . the high mortality rate of mer ##s - co ##v focused attention on the ecology of the virus . it has been found that mer ##s - co ##v belongs to the group c lineage of the genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . corona ##virus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus , and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike ( s ##1 ) and rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase proteins of mer ##s - co ##v have revealed that it is related to bat viruses . recently , the mer ##s - co ##v and its neutral ##izing antibodies were detected in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . despite the limited number of reported cases of person - to - person transmission , the rapid evolution of the virus poses a continuous threat to humans worldwide . this paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the vi ##rol ##ogy , clinical spectrum , evolution , diagnosis and treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
since severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) share similar characteristics with respect to clinical signs , et ##iology , and transmission , methods for a rapid and accurate differential diagnosis are important . therefore , the aim of this study was to develop a du ##plex real - time reverse transcription ( rt ) - pc ##r method for the simultaneous detection of these viruses . prime ##rs and probe ##s that target the conserved spike s ##2 region of human sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , and their related bat co ##vs were designed . the results of real - time rt - pc ##r showed specific reactions for each virus with adequate detection limits of 50 – 100 copies / ml and 5 – 100 copies / ml using pu ##c ##57 - sar ##s - ps ##2 ( a template for sar ##s - co ##v ) and pg ##em - mer ##s - s ##2 ( a template for mer ##s - co ##v ) , respectively . in addition , this real - time rt - pc ##r system was able to detect the target viruses sar ##s - like bat co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in bat fe ##cal samples and sp ##ut ##um of mer ##s patients , respectively . therefore , this newly developed real - time rt - pc ##r method is expected to detect not only sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in humans but also several bat co ##vs that are closely related to these viruses in bats .  
to reveal the put ##ative cellular factors involved in sar ##s corona ##virus replication , the he ##lica ##se ( he ##l , ns ##p ##13 ) of sar ##s corona ##virus was used to screen the cd ##na library of rat pulmonary ep ##ith ##elial cells using the yeast two - hybrid system . positively interacting proteins were further tested using a mammalian cell hybrid system and co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation in the human a ##54 ##9 cell line , which has been shown to support sar ##s corona ##virus replication . out of the seven positive clones observed by yeast two - hybrid ass ##ay , only the dd ##x ##5 ( as ##p - g ##lu - ala - as ##p box poly ##pe ##pt ##ide 5 ) protein showed specific interaction with sar ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se . when expression of dd ##x ##5 was knocked down by small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) , sar ##s corona ##virus replication was significantly inhibit ##ed in fetal r ##hes ##us kidney ( fr ##h ##k - 4 ) cells . since dd ##x ##5 is a multi ##fu ##nction ##al protein that plays important roles in transcription ##al regulation , its interaction with sar ##s corona ##virus he ##lica ##se provides interesting clues for studying virus – host cell interactions in sar ##s - co ##v infections . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##00 ##70 ##5 - 00 ##9 - 03 ##23 - y ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
emerging infectious diseases have caused a global effort for development of fast and accurate detection techniques . the rapidly mu ##tat ##ing nature of viruses presents a major difficulty , highlighting the need for specific detection of genetically diverse strains . one such infectious agent is sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which emerged in 2003 . this study aimed to develop a real - time rt - pc ##r detection ass ##ay specific for sar ##s - co ##v , taking into account its intrinsic poly ##morphic nature due to genetic drift and rec ##om ##bina ##tion and the possibility of continuous and multiple introductions of genetically non - identical strains into the human population , by using mis ##mat ##ch - tolerant molecular beacon ##s designed to specifically detect the sar ##s - co ##v s , e , m and n genes . these were applied in simple , rep ##rod ##ucible du ##plex and multiple ##x real - time pc ##r ass ##ays on 25 post - mort ##em samples and constructed rna controls , and they demonstrated high target detection ability and specific ##ity . this ass ##ay can readily be adapted for detection of other emerging and rapidly mu ##tat ##ing pathogen ##s .  
the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v remains largely unknown . to study the function of the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , we have conducted a yeast two - hybrid screening experiment to identify cellular proteins that may interact with the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . p ##yr ##u ##vate kinase ( liver ) was found to interact with sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in this experiment . the binding domains of these two proteins were also determined using the yeast two - hybrid system . the physical interaction between the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and cellular p ##yr ##u ##vate kinase ( liver ) proteins was further confirmed by gs ##t pull - down ass ##ay , co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay and con ##fo ##cal microscopy . cellular p ##yr ##u ##vate kinase activity in he ##pa ##tom ##a cells was rep ##ressed by sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in either transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed or stab ##ly trans ##fect ##ed cells . p ##k deficiency in red blood cells is known to result in human hereditary non - sp ##her ##oc ##ytic hem ##ol ##ytic an ##emia . it is reasonable to assume that an inhibition of p ##k ##l activity due to interaction with sar ##s - co ##v n protein is likely to cause the death of the he ##pa ##to ##cytes , which results in the elevation of serum alan ##ine amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se and liver dysfunction noted in most sar ##s patients . thus , our results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v could reduce p ##yr ##u ##vate kinase activity via its nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , and this may in turn cause disease .  
we previously reported that cells with persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection were established after ap ##op ##to ##tic events . in the present study , we investigated the cy ##top ##athic effects of dual infection with sar ##s - co ##v and my ##co ##pl ##as ##ma fe ##rm ##ent ##ans on ve ##ro e ##6 cells . dual infection completely killed cells and prevented the establishment of persistent sar ##s - co ##v infection . m . fe ##rm ##ent ##ans induced inhibition of cell proliferation , but the cells remained alive . ap ##op ##tosis was induced easily in m . fe ##rm ##ent ##ans - infected cells , indicating that they were prime ##d for ap ##op ##tosis . these results indicated that m . fe ##rm ##ent ##ans enhance ##s ap ##op ##tosis in surviving cells that have escaped from sar ##s - co ##v - induced ap ##op ##tosis .  
the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona - virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is still a matter of speculation , although more than one year has passed since the onset of the sar ##s outbreak . in this study , we implemented a 3 - step strategy to test the intriguing hypothesis that sar ##s - co ##v might have been derived from a rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus . first , we blasted the whole sar ##s - co ##v genome against a virus database to search viruses of interest . second , we employed 7 rec ##om ##bina ##tion detection techniques well documented in successfully detecting rec ##om ##bina ##tion events to explore the presence of rec ##om ##bina ##tion in sar ##s - co ##v genome . finally , we conducted phylogenetic analyses to further explore whether rec ##om ##bina ##tion has indeed occurred in the course of corona ##virus ##es history pre ##dating the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v . surprisingly , we found that 7 put ##ative rec ##om ##bina ##tion regions , located in replica ##se 1a ##b and spike protein , exist between sar ##s - co ##v and other 6 corona ##virus ##es : por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus ( pe ##d ##v ) , trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus ( t ##ge ##v ) , bo ##vine corona ##virus ( bc ##ov ) , human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov ) , mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) , and av ##ian infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) . thus , our analyses sub ##stan ##tia ##te the presence of rec ##om ##bina ##tion events in history that led to the sar ##s - co ##v genome . like the other corona ##virus ##es used in the analysis , sar ##s - co ##v is also a mosaic structure .  
two neutral ##izing human sc ##f ##v , b1 and h ##12 were identified initially using elisa , employing highly pu ##rified virus as the coating antigen . the bio ##sen ##sor technique based on imaging el ##lip ##some ##try was employed directly to detect two neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and serial serum samples from 10 sar ##s patients and 12 volunteers who had not sar ##s . further , the kinetic process of interaction between the antibodies and sar ##s - co ##v was studied using the real - time function of the bio ##sen ##sor . the bio ##sen ##sor is consistent with elisa that the antibody h ##12 showed a higher affinity in encounter ##ing the virus than antibody b1 . the affinity of antibody b1 and antibody h ##12 was 9 . 5 × 10 ( 6 ) m ( − ##1 ) and 1 . 36 × 10 ( 7 ) m ( − 1 ) , respectively . as a label free method , the bio ##sen ##sor based on imaging el ##lip ##some ##try proved to be a more competent mechanism for measuring serum samples from sar ##s patients and the affinity between these antibodies and the sar ##s corona ##virus .  
background : sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) induced cell ap ##op ##tosis and its structural proteins may play a role in this process . objectives : to determine whether the structural proteins m and n of sar ##s - co ##v induce ap ##op ##tosis . study design : we investigated human pulmonary fi ##bro ##bla ##st ( hp ##f ) cells , were trans ##fect ##ed with pl ##as ##mi ##ds containing the m or n gene , by td ##t - mediated du ##tp nick end labeling ( tune ##l ) , ho ##ech ##st 333 ##42 stain ##ing for nuclei , and observation of morphology . results : we found that in the absence of serum about 16 . 34 % of cells trans ##fect ##ed by pc ##dna ##3 . 1 - m and 21 . 72 % of n - trans ##fect ##ed cells showed typical ap ##op ##to ##tic characteristics , significantly different from mock - trans ##fect ##ed cells ( only 6 . 23 % , p < 0 . 01 ) . furthermore , the cells that were co - trans ##fect ##ed with m and n proteins showed more obvious phenomena of cell death ( about 36 . 03 % ) . there was a statistical significance between m - trans ##fect ##ed cells and co - trans ##fect ##ed cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and a remarkable difference between n - trans ##fect ##ed cells and co - trans ##fect ##ed cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) . conclusions : the results show that m and n proteins of sar ##s - co ##v can induce ap ##op ##tosis of hp ##f cells . co - trans ##fect ##ion of m and n enhance ##s the induction of ap ##op ##tosis by m or n alone , which also suggests that the structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v may play an important role not only in the process of invasion but also in the pathogen ##etic process in cells .  
to provide optimal cut - off values of anti - middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ser ##olo ##gic tests , we evaluated performance of elisa i ##gg , elisa i ##ga , if ##a i ##gm , and if ##a i ##gg using 138 serum samples of 49 mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients and 219 serum samples of 219 rr ##t - pc ##r - negative mer ##s - co ##v - exposed healthcare personnel and patients . the performance analysis was conducted for two different purposes : ( 1 ) prediction of neutral ##ization activity in mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients , and ( 2 ) ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v infections among mer ##s - co ##v - exposed individuals . to evaluate performance according to serum collection time , we used ‘ days post onset of illness ( d ##po ##i ) ’ and ‘ days post exposure ( d ##pe ##x ) ’ assessing neutral ##ization activity and infection diagnosis , respectively . performance of ser ##olo ##gic tests improved with delayed sampling time , being maximize ##d after a ser ##oco ##n ##version period . in predicting neutral ##ization activity , elisa i ##gg tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 d ##po ##i at cut - off values of o ##d ratio 0 . 4 ( sensitivity 100 % and specific ##ity 100 % ) , and elisa i ##ga showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 d ##po ##i at cut - off value of o ##d ratio 0 . 2 ( sensitivity 85 . 2 % and specific ##ity 100 % ) . in diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infection , elisa i ##gg exhibited optimal performance using sera collected after 28 d ##pe ##x , at a cut - off value of o ##d ratio 0 . 2 ( sensitivity 97 . 3 % and specific ##ity 92 . 9 % ) . these new break ##points are markedly lower than previously suggested values ( elisa i ##gg o ##d ratio 1 . 1 , sensitivity 34 . 8 % and specific ##ity 100 % in the present data set ) , and the performance data help ser ##olo ##gic tests to be practically used in the field of mer ##s management . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##100 ##9 ##6 - 01 ##7 - 304 ##3 - 3 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
in order to further the present knowledge of the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , 48 ##6 different specimens from 54 patients with a clinical diagnosis of sar ##s were investigated for the presence of viral rna , and 314 plasma specimens of 73 patients were examined for i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies specific against sar ##s - co ##v using an indirect elisa . viral rna was detect ##able in 28 of the 54 patients tested . cumulative data showed that 67 of the 73 sar ##s patients demonstrated ser ##oco ##n ##version by week 5 of illness . in contrast , only 1 of 278 healthy subjects enrolled in the study was found to be positive for the i ##gg antibody . coe ##xi ##sten ##ce of viral rna in plasma and specific antibodies was simultaneously observed over three consecutive weeks in two critical cases . in three con ##vale ##scent patients in particular , cult ##iva ##ble sar ##s - co ##v was detected in stool or urine specimens for longer than 4 weeks ( 29 – 36 days ) . these findings suggest that sar ##s - co ##v may remain viable in the ex ##cre ##tions of con ##vale ##scent patients .  
a number of structural gen ##omics / pro ##te ##omics initiatives are focused on bacterial or viral pathogen ##s . in this article , we will review the progress of structural pro ##te ##omics initiatives targeting the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , the et ##iol ##ogical agent of the 2003 worldwide epidemic that culminated in approximately 8 , 000 cases and 800 deaths . the sar ##s - co ##v genome en ##codes 28 proteins in three distinct classes , many of them with unknown function and sharing low similarity to other proteins . the structures of 16 sar ##s - co ##v proteins or functional domains have been determined to date . remarkably , eight of these 16 proteins or functional domains have novel folds , indicating the unique ##ness of the corona ##virus proteins . the results of sar ##s - co ##v structural pro ##te ##omics initiatives will have several profound biological impacts , including el ##uc ##ida ##tion of the structure – function relationships of corona ##virus proteins ; identification of targets for the design of anti - viral compounds against sar ##s - co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es ; and addition of new protein folds to the fold space , with further understanding of the structure – function relationships for several new protein families . we discuss the use of structural pro ##te ##omics in response to emerging infectious diseases such as sar ##s - co ##v and to increase prepared ##ness against future emerging corona ##virus ##es .  
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 – 2003 has had a significant impact worldwide . no effective prop ##hyl ##ax ##is or treatment for sar ##s is available up to now . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the cellular receptor for sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . by expressing a u ##6 promoter - driven small interfering rna containing sequences homo ##log ##ous to part of ace ##2 mrna , we successfully silenced ace ##2 expression in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . by detecting negative strand sar ##s - co ##v rna and measuring rna copy numbers of sar ##s - co ##v by real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , we demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v infection was reduced in the ace ##2 - silenced cell lines . these findings support the involvement of ace ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v infections and provide a basis for further studies on potential use of sir ##na targeting ace ##2 as a prevent ##ive or therapeutic strategy for sar ##s .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been implicated consistently as the source of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) human infections and attention to prevent and control it has focused on camel ##s . to understanding the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological role of camel ##s in the transmission of mer ##s - co ##v , we utilized an it ##erative empirical process in geographic information system ( gi ##s ) to identify and qualify potential hot ##sp ##ots for maintenance and circulation of mer ##s - co ##v , and produced risk - based surveillance sites in kenya . data on camel population and distribution were used to develop camel density map , while camel farming system was defined using multi - factor ##ial criteria including the ag ##ro - ecological zones ( ae ##z ##s ) , production and marketing practices . primary and secondary mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce data from specific sites were analyzed , and location - based prevalence matching with camel den ##sities was conducted . high - risk convergence points ( migration zones , trade routes , camel markets , slaughter slabs ) were profile ##d and frequent cross - border camel movement mapped . results showed that high camel - dense areas and interaction ( markets and migration zones ) were potential hot ##sp ##ot for transmission and spread . cross - border contacts occurred with in - migrated herds at hot ##sp ##ot locations . ae ##z differential did not influence risk distribution and plausible risk factors for spatial mer ##s - co ##v hot ##sp ##ots were camel den ##sities , previous cases of mer ##s - co ##v , high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce and points of camel convergence ##s . although kenyan camel ##s are pre ##dis ##posed to mer ##s - co ##v , no shed ##ding is documented to date . these potential hot ##sp ##ots , determined using ant ##hr ##op ##ogenic , system and trade characterization ##s should guide selection of sampling / surveillance sites , high - risk locations , critical areas for interventions and policy development in kenya , as well as ins ##ti ##gate further vi ##rol ##ogical examination of camel ##s . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##10 ##39 ##3 - 01 ##8 - 131 ##7 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the study presented here was conducted to evaluate the performance of a double - antigen sandwich elisa to detect antibodies in human serum against the corona ##virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . a rec ##om ##bina ##nt partial nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus was used as a ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##stic antigen in the elisa . a total of 289 ##2 clinical serum samples were tested with the elisa kit , which positively identified 25 of 35 ( 71 . 4 % ) samples of patients with confirmed sar ##s infection , 286 of 407 ( 70 % ) samples of patients suspected of having sar ##s , 229 of 302 ( 75 . 8 % ) samples of con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients , and 0 of 54 ##4 samples obtained from healthcare workers ; only 1 of 1604 clinical samples obtained from patients with other diseases demonstrated a weakly positive result . these results indicate that the double - antigen sandwich elisa is an effective screening method for the ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is highly pathogen ##ic . an im ##mun ##ose ##nsor for the determination of mer ##s - co ##v is described here . it is based on a competitive ass ##ay carried out on an array of carbon electrode ##s ( de ##p ) modified with gold nano ##par ##tic ##les . rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike protein s ##1 was used as a bio ##mark ##er for mer ##s co ##v . the electrode array enables multiple ##xed detection of different co ##vs . the bio ##sen ##sor is based on indirect competition between free virus in the sample and im ##mo ##bil ##ized mer ##s - co ##v protein for a fixed concentration of antibody added to the sample . volta ##mme ##tric response is detected by monitoring the change in the peak current ( typically acquired at a working potential of − ##0 . 05 v vs . ag / ag ##cl ) after addition of different concentrations of antigen against mer ##s - co ##v . electro ##chemical measurements using fe ##rro ##cy ##ani ##de / fe ##rri ##cy ##ani ##de as a probe were recorded using square wave volta ##mme ##try ( sw ##v ) . good linear response between the sensor response and the concentrations from 0 . 001 to 100 ng . ml ( − ##1 ) and 0 . 01 to 10 , 000 ng . ml ( − ##1 ) were observed for mer ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov , respectively . the ass ##ay was performed in 20 min with detection limit as low as 0 . 4 and 1 . 0 pg . ml ( − ##1 ) for hc ##ov and mer ##s - co ##v , respectively . the method is highly selective over non - specific proteins such as influenza a and b . the method is single - step , sensitive and accurate . it was successfully applied to spiked nasal samples .

high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s has been previously reported in united arab emirates ( uae ) . however , the molecular detection of the virus has never been reported before in uae . of the 7 , 80 ##3 nasal sw ##ab ##s tested in the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological survey , mer ##s - co ##v nuclei ##c acid was detected by real - time pc ##r in a total of 126 ( 1 . 6 % ) camel ##s . positive camel ##s were detected at the borders with saudi arabia and oman and in camel ##s ’ slaughter houses . mer ##s - co ##v partial sequences obtained from uae camel ##s were cluster ##ing with human - and camel - derived mer ##s - co ##v sequences in the same geographic area . results provide further evidence of mer ##s - co ##v zoo ##nosis .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious and predominantly p ##ne ##um ##onic illness caused by a novel corona ##virus now commonly known as sar ##s - co ##v . this article describes the key diagnostic clinical features , radio ##logic features , and investigation profiles of affected patients . we sum ##mar ##ize our understanding from an ##ec ##dot ##al experience and limited published data on the use of anti ##vira ##l and co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid therapy in the management of this highly con ##tag ##ious disease .  
to identify the potential b - cell antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes within the n - terminus of sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - associated corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v ) m protein and character ##ize mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) against the protein as well as its recognizing region , we expressed and pu ##rified a portion of sar ##s - co ##v m protein ( amino acid 1 – 43 ) in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli ( e . coli ) . by using western b ##lot and enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , we showed that the pu ##rified rec ##om ##bina ##nt m protein could be recognized by four sar ##s - co ##v - positive human sera even when those sera were 12 , 800 - fold dil ##uted . furthermore , we characterized one representative i ##gg ##2 mab , 3 ##h ##9 , which exhibited a strong im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ion to both rec ##om ##bina ##nt m protein and native viral protein of sar ##s - co ##v . we found a b - cell antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pe located between amino acid 1 – 15 and defined the mab recognizing region within amino acid 16 – 28 of m . these findings not only suggest that both rec ##om ##bina ##nt m protein and its specific mab ##s may be used as the diagnostic re ##age ##nts for sar ##s , but also provide a potential target site for the design of an ep ##ito ##pe - based vaccine against sar ##s .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel zoo ##not ##ic pathogen . in 2012 , the infectious outbreak caused by mer ##s - co ##v in saudi arabia has spread to more than 1600 patients in 26 countries , resulting in over 600 deaths . without a travel history , few clinical and radio ##logical features can re ##lia ##bly differentiate mer ##s from sar ##s . but in real world , comparing with sar ##s , mer ##s presents more vaguely defined ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , more severe symptoms , and higher case fatal ##ity rate . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the recent findings in the field of mer ##s - co ##v , especially its molecular vi ##rol ##ogy , inter ##sp ##ec ##ies mechanisms , clinical features , anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies , and the further investigation into this disease . as a newly emerging virus , many questions are not fully answered , including the exact mode of transmission chain , geographical distribution , and animal origins . furthermore , a new protocol needs to be launched to rapidly evaluate the effects of un ##pro ##ven anti ##vira ##l drugs and vaccine to fast ##en the clinical application of new drugs .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the clinical characteristics are high fever , rapidly progressive diffuse p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis and respiratory distress . it is highly infectious through intimate contact or direct contact with infectious body fluids . outbreak ##s within communities and hospitals have been reported . development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed . we developed an im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , using whole virus antigen of sar ##s - co ##v . eighty - six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut - off o . d . value . the cut - off o . d . value was defined as 0 . 175 by calculating the mean o . d . value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviation ##s . to determine the sensitivity and specific ##ity of the elisa , 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested . the sensitivity was 96 . 4 % and the specific ##ity was 100 % . the results suggest that the i ##gg elisa using whole virus antigen of sar ##s - co ##v has a high sensitivity and specific ##ity in detecting sar ##s i ##gg antibodies . this i ##gg elisa is a powerful tool for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes a highly basic nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein which can inhibit the synthesis of type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , but the molecular mechanism of this ant ##ago ##nism remains to be identified . in this study , we demonstrated that the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v could inhibit if ##n - beta ( if ##n - β ) induced by poly ( i : c ) or send ##ai virus . however , we found that n protein could not inhibit if ##n - β production induced by over ##ex ##press ##ion of downstream signaling molecules of two important if ##n - β induction pathways , toll - like receptor 3 ( t ##lr ##3 ) - and rig - i - like receptors ( r ##lr ) - dependent pathways . these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v n protein targets the initial step , probably the cellular pr ##rs ( pattern recognition receptors ) - rna ##s - recognition step in the innate immune pathways , to suppress if ##n expression responses . in addition , co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ays revealed that n protein did not interact with rig - i or md ##a ##5 . further , an ass ##ay using truncated mutants revealed that the c - terminal domain of n protein was critical for its ant ##ago ##nism of if ##n induction , and the n del ##eti ##on mutant impaired for rna - binding almost completely lost the if ##n - β antagonist activity . these results contribute to our further understanding of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v e gene fragment was clone ##d and expressed as a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein fused with a my ##c tag at the n - terminus in vitro and in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . similar to other n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted proteins , the g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of sar ##s - co ##v e protein occurred co - translation ##ally in the presence of micro ##some ##s . the sar ##s - co ##v e protein is predicted to be a double - spanning membrane protein lacking a conventional signal peptide . both of the trans ##me ##mb ##rane regions ( a . a . 11 – 33 and 37 – 59 ) are predicted to be α - he ##lices , which penetrate into membranes by themselves . as expected , these two trans ##me ##mb ##rane regions inserted a cy ##top ##las ##mic protein into the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum membrane . either of these two trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains co - localized with m protein . both the trans ##me ##mb ##rane domains of e protein are required to interact with m protein , while either of the hydro ##phi ##lic regions ( a . a . 1 – 10 or 60 – 76 ) is di ##sp ##ens ##able as shown by co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay . these results are important for the study of sar ##s - co ##v assembly . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##11 ##26 ##2 - 00 ##9 - 03 ##41 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection , in this study , we investigated the role of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein in the regulation of cy ##cl ##oo ##xy ##genase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) . expression of cox - 2 stimulated by the s protein was verified by rt - pc ##r and western b ##lot ass ##ay . to explore the relationship between s and cox - 2 , we constructed a series of pl ##as ##mi ##ds containing truncated n - terminal fragments of the sar ##s - co ##v s gene ( designated from sa to si ) , which encoded truncated s proteins , and investigated whether these truncated proteins could induce effective expression of cox - 2 in 293 ##t cells . our results showed that s ( d ) that encoded a truncated s protein with 422 amino acid residues ( from 1 to 422 aa ) , a part of 67 ##2 amino - acid s ##1 subunit is crucial for the induction of cox - 2 expression . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence examinations also give the evidence that these n terminal 422 amino acids of the s protein were also required for the correct local ##ization of the protein . we also compared s protein sequences of sar ##s - co ##v isolated during the sar ##s break with that from palm ci ##vet ##s , a possible source of sar ##s - co ##v found in humans . s protein residues ( 344 , 360 ) , which mu ##tated in the ep ##ito ##me from palm ci ##vet to human being were characterized in 3d modeling of 252 – 375 amino acid fragment . collectively , these results indicate that s protein of sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s the expression of cox - 2 and an n - terminal fragment of the spike protein is crucial for the induction . our finding may provide clue for the induction of inflammation by sar ##s - co ##v and cast insight into the severity of the sar ##s epidemic .  
sar ##s - co ##v m gene fragment was clone ##d and expressed as a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein fused with a v ##5 tag at the c - terminus in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . in addition to un - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted and g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted proteins , one product with smaller size initiated in - frame from the third met residues probably through rib ##osomal re - initiation was also detected . translation initiated in - frame from the third met is unusual since the sequence around the first met of sar ##s - co ##v m protein contains the optimal consensus ko ##zak sequence . the function of this smaller translated product await ##s further investigation . similar to other n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted proteins , g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of sar ##s - co ##v m protein was occurred co - translation ##ally in the presence of micro ##some ##s . the sar ##s - co ##v m protein is predicted as a triple - spanning membrane protein lack of a conventional signal peptide . the second and third trans - membrane regions ( a . a . 46 – 68 and 78 – 100 ) are predicted to be the primary type he ##lices , which will be able to penetrate into membrane by themselves , while the first trans - membrane region ( a . a . 14 – 36 ) is predicted to be the secondary type helix , which is considered to be stabilized by the interaction with other trans - membrane segments . as expected , the second and third trans - membrane regions were able to insert a cy ##top ##las ##mic protein into the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum membrane more efficiently than the first one . these results should be important for the study of sar ##s - co ##v mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##11 ##37 ##3 - 00 ##8 - 92 ##35 - 1 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the emergence of new pathogen ##s , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and e ##bola virus , poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel anti ##vira ##l approaches . mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) have been successfully used to treat various diseases , particularly cancer and im ##mun ##ological disorders . antigen - specific mab ##s have been isolated using several different approaches , including hybrid ##oma , trans ##genic mice , ph ##age display , yeast display , and single b - cell isolation . consequently , an increasing number of mab ##s , which exhibit high pot ##ency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection , have been developed . in this paper , we sum ##mar ##ize historical trends and recent developments in mab discovery , compare the advantages and disadvantage ##s of various approaches to mab production , and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of anti ##vira ##ls against emerging diseases . we also review the application of recently developed human mab ##s against sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , and e ##bola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mab ##s as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) virus caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003 . the virus is a novel corona ##virus , which may have an origin in wild animals such as ci ##vet cats in southern china . its genome structure , gene expression pattern and protein profiles are similar to those of other corona ##virus ##es . however , distinct patterns of several open reading frames in the sar ##s virus genome may contribute to its severe vi ##ru ##lence . the potential mu ##ta ##bility of the corona ##virus genome may pose problems in the control of future sar ##s outbreak ##s . the mechanism of sar ##s pathogen ##esis may involve both direct viral cy ##to ##ci ##dal effects on the target cells and immune - mediated mechanisms . the life cycle of the sar ##s virus is largely unknown ; however , based on the analogy with other corona ##virus ##es , several potential targets for anti ##vira ##l development are identified . vaccines offer an important prevent ##ive measure for possible future rec ##ur ##rence ##s of sar ##s , but the prospect for their development is still unknown because of the uncertainty regarding the role of immune responses in sar ##s virus pathogen ##esis . the comparative studies of other corona ##virus ##es offer insights into the understanding of sar ##s virus .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome . the aim of this study was to construct sar ##s - co ##v membrane ( m ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and spike 2 ( s ##2 ) gene eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds , and identify their expression in vitro . gene fragments encoding n protein , m protein and s ##2 protein of sar ##s - co ##v were amplified by pc ##r using cd ##na obtained from lung samples of sar ##s patients as template , and sub ##cl ##oned into pc ##dna ##3 . 1 vector to form eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds . sar ##s - co ##v protein eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds were trans ##fect ##ed respectively into cho cells . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry was employed to detect the expression of the structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v in trans ##fect ##ed cells . sar ##s - co ##v protein eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds were successfully constructed by identification with digest ##ion of restriction enzymes and sequencing . m , n and s ##2 proteins of sar ##s - co ##v were detected in the cy ##top ##las ##m of trans ##fect ##ed cho cells . it was concluded that these rec ##om ##bina ##nt eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds were constructed successfully , and sar ##s - co ##v encoding proteins could activate transcription and expression of h ##f ##gl ##2 gene .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the most likely source for the corona ##virus that sporadic ##ally causes middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in humans . ser ##ological results from archived camel sera provide evidence for circulation of mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) among dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the greater horn of africa as far back as 1983 and in saudi arabia as far back as 1992 . high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce ##s of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies and the high virus prevalence in saudi arabian dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s indicate an endemic ##ity of the virus in the arabian peninsula , which pre ##dates the 2012 human mer ##s index case . saudi arabian dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s show significantly higher mer ##s - co ##v carrier rates than dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s imported from africa . two mer ##s - co ##v lineage ##s identified in nigerian camel ##s were found to be genetically distinct from those found in camel ##s and humans in the middle east . this supports the hypothesis that camel imports from africa are not of significance for circulation of the virus in camel populations of the arabian peninsula .  
the objective of this research was to investigate the prevalence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection primarily in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel farms and the relationship of those infections with infections in humans in the emir ##ate of abu dhabi . nasal sw ##ab ##s from 111 ##3 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ( 39 farms ) and 34 sheep ( 1 farm ) and sp ##ut ##um samples from 2 mer ##s - co ##v - infected camel farm owners and 1 mer ##s - co ##v - infected sheep farm owner were collected . samples from camel ##s and humans underwent real - time reverse - transcription quantitative pc ##r screening to detect mer ##s - co ##v . in addition , sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized mer ##s - co ##v genome fragments obtained from camel ##s were performed . among the 40 farms , 6 camel farms were positive for mer ##s - co ##v ; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm . the maximum duration of viral shed ##ding from infected camel ##s was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal sw ##ab ##s and in rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s obtained from infected calves . three partial camel sequences characterized in this study ( open reading frames 1a and 1a ##b , spike ##1 , spike ##2 , and or ##f ##4 ##b ) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported mer ##s - co ##v sequence obtained from one farm owner were cluster ##ing together within the larger mer ##s - co ##v sequences cluster containing human and camel isolate ##s reported for the arabian peninsula . data provided further evidence of the zoo ##not ##ic potential of mer ##s - co ##v infection and strongly suggested that camel ##s may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus which can cause acute respiratory distress in humans and is associated with a relatively high mortality rate . since it was first identified in a patient who died in a jed ##dah hospital in 2012 , the world health organization has been notified of 1735 laboratory - confirmed cases from 27 countries , including 62 ##8 deaths . most cases have occurred in saudi arabia . mer ##s - co ##vances ##tors may be found in old ##world bats of the ve ##sper ##ti ##lion ##idae family . after a proposed bat to camel switching event , transmission of mer ##s - co ##v to humans is likely to have been the result of multiple zoo ##not ##ic transfers from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . human - to - human transmission appears to require close contact with infected persons , with outbreak ##s mainly occurring in hospital environments . outbreak ##s have been associated with inadequate infection prevention and control implementation , resulting in recommendations on basic and more advanced infection prevention and control measures by the world health organization , and issuing of government guidelines based on these recommendations in affected countries including saudi arabia . evolutionary changes in the virus , particularly in the viral spike protein which media ##tes virus - host cell contact may potentially increase transmission of this virus . efforts are on - going to identify specific evidence - based the ##ra ##pies or vaccines . the broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l ni ##ta ##zo ##xa ##ni ##de has been shown to have in vitro activity against mer ##s - co ##v . synthetic peptide ##s and candidate vaccines based on regions of the spike protein have shown promise in rode ##nt and non - human primate models . g ##ls - 530 ##0 , a prop ##hyl ##actic dna - pl ##as ##mi ##d vaccine encoding s protein , is the first mer ##s - co ##v vaccine to be tested in humans , while mono ##cl ##onal antibody , m3 ##36 has given promising results in animal models and has potential for use in outbreak situations .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a fatal disease . prevention of future outbreak ##s is essential and requires understanding pathogen ##esis and evolution of the virus . we have isolated a sar ##s - co ##v in china and analyzed 47 sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s with the aims to reveal the evolution trends of the virus and provide insights into understanding pathogen ##esis and sar ##s epidemic . specimen from a sar ##s patient was in ##oc ##ulated into cell culture . the presence of sar ##s - co ##v was determined by rt - pc ##r and confirmed by electron microscopy . virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences , which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s . genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogen ##esis and the epidemic were characterized . this viral genome consists of 29 , 72 ##8 nu ##cle ##otide ##s with overall organization in agreement with that of published isolate ##s . a total of 34 ##8 positions were mu ##tated on 47 viral genome ##s . among them 22 had mutations in more than three genome ##s . hot spots of nu ##cle ##otide variations and unique trends of mutations were identified on the viral genome ##s . mutation rates were different from gene to gene and were correlated well with periodical or geographic characteristics of the epidemic .  
the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is thought to play a complex and central role in the biology and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s corona ##virus infection . in this study , a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein ( rs ##26 ##8 , corresponding to residues 268 – 125 ##5 of sar ##s - co ##v s protein ) was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and was pu ##rified to near homo ##gen ##eit ##y . after im ##mun ##ization with rs ##26 ##8 , s protein - specific bal ##b / c anti ##ser ##a and mab ##s were induced and confirmed using elisa , western b ##lot and if ##a . several bal ##b / c mab ##s were found to be effectively to neutral ##ize the infection of ve ##ro e ##6 cells by sar ##s - co ##v in a dose - dependent manner . systematic ep ##ito ##pe mapping showed that all these neutral ##izing mab ##s recognized a 15 - residues peptide ( cb - 119 ) corresponding to residues 114 ##3 – 115 ##7 ( spd ##vd ##l ##g ##dis ##gina ##s ) that was located to the second he ##pta ##d repeat ( hr ##2 ) region of the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein . the peptide cb - 119 could specifically inhibit the interaction of neutral ##izing mab ##s and spike protein in a dose - dependent manner . further , neutral ##izing mab ##s , but not control mab ##s , could specifically interact with cb - 119 in a dose - dependent manner . results implicated that the second he ##pta ##d repeat region of spike protein could be a good target for vaccine development against sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a new disease with symptoms similar to those of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , raised a global alert in march 2003 . because of its relatively high trans ##mis ##sibility and mortality upon infection , probable sar ##s patients were qu ##aran ##tine ##d and treated with special and intensive care . therefore , instant and accurate laboratory confirmation of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection has become a worldwide interest . for this need , we pu ##rified rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins including the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and truncated forms of the spike protein ( s ##1 – s ##7 ) of sar ##s - co ##v in ##es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . the six proteins n , e , m , s ##2 , s ##5 , and s ##6 were used for western b ##lot ##ting ( wb ) to detect various im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin classes in 90 serum samples from 54 probable sar ##s patients . the results indicated that n was recognized in most of the sera . in some cases , s ##6 could be recognized as early as 2 or 3 days after illness onset , while s ##5 was recognized at a later stage . furthermore , the result of rec ##om ##bina ##nt - protein - based wb showed a 90 % agreement with that of the whole - virus - based im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay . combining wb with existing rt - pc ##r , the laboratory confirmation for sar ##s - co ##v infection was greatly enhanced by 24 . 1 % , from 48 . 1 % ( rt - pc ##r alone ) to 72 . 2 % . finally , our results show that i ##ga antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v can be detected within 1 week after illness onset in a few sar ##s patients .  
assuming that no human had any previously acquired im ##mun ##op ##rot ##ection against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) during the 2003 sar ##s outbreak , the biological bases for possible difference in individual su ##sc ##ept ##ibility are intriguing . however , this issue has never been fully el ##uc ##ida ##ted . based on the premise that sar ##s patients belonging to a given gen ##otype group having a significantly higher sar ##s infection rate than others would imply that gen ##otype group being more susceptible , we make use of a compartment ##al model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed sar ##s patients from chinese han population in taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate gen ##otype groups among these sar ##s - infected individuals . the results show that c ##x ##cl ##10 ( − ##9 ##38 ##aa ) is always protective whenever it appears , but appears rarely and only jointly with either f ##gl ##2 ( + 158 ##t / * ) or ho - 1 ( − ##49 ##7 ##a / * ) , while ( f ##gl ##2 ) ( + 158 ##t / * ) is associated with higher su ##sc ##ept ##ibility unless combined with c ##x ##cl ##10 / ip - 10 ( − ##9 ##38 ##aa ) , when jointly is associated with lower su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . the novel modeling approach proposed , which does not require sizable case and control gene data ##set ##s , could have important future public health implications in swiftly identifying potential high - risk groups associated with being highly susceptible to a particular infectious disease .  
the 3 ′ - one - third of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome contains genes for four essential structural proteins and eight virus - specific genes . the expression of this gen ##omic information of sar ##s - co ##v involves synthesis of a nest ##ed set of sub ##gen ##omic rna ##s ( sg ##rna ##s ) . in this study , we showed that the translation ##al levels of 10 sar ##s - co ##v sg ##rna ##s including the two low - abundance sg ##rna ##s 2 - 1 and 3 - 1 varied considerably in translation reporter ass ##ays . we also demonstrated that the in ##itia ##tor aug cod ##on of sg ##rna - 8 was silent and the rep ##ress ##ive control was most likely positioned in the upstream un ##tra ##ns ##lated region ( ut ##r ) of sg ##rna - 8 . the in ##itia ##tor aug cod ##ons of most sg ##rna ##s are in poor ko ##zak contexts and the translation of truncated proteins from downstream aug cod ##ons by leak ##y scanning was common in our experimental settings . no significant correlation was found between complexity of 5 ′ - ut ##r and the sequence context of aug cod ##on with the level of translation of sar ##s - co ##v sg ##rna ##s . these results will be helpful for further studies to reveal the biological functions and translation regulatory mechanisms of sg ##rna ##s in the corona ##virus life cycle and pathogen ##esis .  
bats may be natural reservoirs for a large variety of emerging viruses , including mammalian corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) . the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in humans , with evidence that these viruses may have their ancestry in bats , highlights the importance of virus surveillance in bat populations . here , we report the identification and molecular characterization of a bat β - corona ##virus , detected during a viral survey carried out on different bat species in the island of sardinia ( italy ) . cut ##aneous , oral sw ##ab ##s , and fae ##cal samples were collected from 46 bats , belonging to 15 different species , and tested for viral presence . corona ##virus rna was detected in fae ##cal samples from three different species : the greater horseshoe bat ( rhino ##lo ##phus fe ##rr ##ume ##quin ##um ) , the brown long - ear ##ed bat ( pl ##ec ##ot ##us au ##rit ##us ) , and the european free - tailed bat ( tad ##ari ##da ten ##iot ##is ) . phylogenetic analyses based on rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) sequences assigned the detected co ##v to clade 2 ##b within beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , cluster ##ing with sar ##s - like bat co ##vs previously reported . these findings point to the need for continued surveillance of bat co ##v circulating in sardinia ##n bats , and extend the current knowledge on co ##v ecology with novel sequences detected in bat species not previously described as β - corona ##virus hosts .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) came to attention as an emerging pathogen causing severe respiratory illness in patients from the middle east in september 2012 . as of 14 june 2013 , 58 human cases of mer ##s co ##v infection have been confirmed , including 33 deaths ( case fatal ##ity rate of 57 % ) . mer ##s co ##v is a beta - corona ##virus , in the same family as sar ##s - co ##v , and shares a probable origin from bats . no animal reservoir or intermediate ##s have been definitely implicated in transmission . limited human - to - human transmission has occurred within several clusters , as individuals without a recent travel history have become infected after exposure to an ill returned traveler .  
bats have been widely known as natural reservoir hosts of zoo ##not ##ic diseases , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) . in the present study , we investigated the whole gen ##omic sequence of a sar ##s - like bat co ##v ( 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 ) and found it to be 29 , 07 ##5 nt in length with a 40 . 9 % g + c content . phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of the or ##f 1a ##b and the spike gene showed that the bat corona ##virus strain 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 was grouped with the beta - co ##v lineage b and was closely related to the j ##tm ##c ##15 strain isolated from rhino ##lo ##phus fe ##rr ##ume ##quin ##um in china . however , 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 was distinctly located in the phylogenetic topology of the human sar ##s co ##v strain ( tor ##2 ) . interesting ##ly , 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 showed complete elimination of or ##f ##8 regions induced by a frame shift of the stop cod ##on in or ##f ##7 ##b . the lowest amino acid identity of 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 was identified at the spike region among various or ##fs . the spike region of 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 showed 84 . 7 % and 75 . 2 % amino acid identity with rf ##1 ( sar ##s - like bat co ##v ) and tor ##2 ( human sar ##s co ##v ) , respectively . in addition , the s gene of 16 ##bo ##13 ##3 was found to contain the amino acid substitution of two critical residues ( n ##47 ##9 ##s and t ##48 ##7 v ) associated with human infection . in conclusion , we firstly carried out whole genome characterization of the sar ##s - like bat corona ##virus discovered in the republic of korea ; however , it presumably has no human in ##fect ##ivity . however , continuous surveillance and gen ##omic characterization of corona ##virus ##es from bats are necessary due to potential risks of human infection induced by genetic mutation . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##11 ##26 ##2 - 01 ##9 - 01 ##66 ##8 - w ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 brought back memories of the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 . more than 1500 mer ##s - co ##v cases were recorded in 42 months with a case fatal ##ity rate ( cf ##r ) of 40 % . meanwhile , 800 ##0 cases of sar ##s - co ##v were confirmed in six months with a cf ##r of 10 % . the clinical presentation of mer ##s - co ##v ranges from mild and non - specific presentation to progressive and severe pneumonia . no predict ##ive signs or symptoms exist to differentiate mer ##s - co ##v from community - acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients . an apparent het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y was observed in transmission . most mer ##s - co ##v cases were secondary to large outbreak ##s in healthcare settings . these cases were secondary to community - acquired cases , which may also cause family outbreak ##s . travel - associated mer ##s infection remains low . however , the virus exhibited a clear tendency to cause large outbreak ##s outside the arabian peninsula as exemplified by the outbreak in the republic of korea . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the current knowledge about mer ##s - co ##v and highlight travel - related issues .  
in 2012 , a novel corona ##virus , initially named as human corona ##virus em ##c ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) but recently renamed as middle east respiratory syndrome human corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , was identified in patients who suffered severe acute respiratory infection and subsequent renal failure that resulted in death . ongoing ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations together with retrospective studies have found 61 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with this novel corona ##virus , including 34 deaths to date . this novel corona ##virus is cult ##urable and two complete genome sequences are now available . furthermore , molecular detection and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay have been developed . the present paper sum ##mar ##ises the limited recent advances of this novel human corona ##virus , including its discovery , gen ##omic character ##isation and detection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was first recognized in china in november 2002 and was subsequently associated with a worldwide outbreak involving 80 ##9 ##8 people , 77 ##4 of whom died . the outbreak was declared contained on july 5 , 2003 , after the last human chain of transmission of sar ##s had been broken . whether outbreak ##s of sar ##s will return is de ##bat ##able , but no one disagree ##s that it is important to be prepared for this possibility . this article presents an overview of the transmission and control of sar ##s based on the current state of knowledge derived from published studies of the outbreak and on our own personal experience .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) structural proteins ( s , e , m , and nc ) local ##ize in different sub ##cellular positions when expressed individually . however , sar ##s - co ##v m protein is co - localized almost entirely with s , e , or nc protein when co - expressed in the cells . on the other hand , only partial co - local ##ization was observed when s and e , s and nc , or e and nc were co - expressed in the cells . interactions between sar ##s - co ##v m and other structural proteins but not interactions between s and e , s and nc , or e and nc were further demonstrated by co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay . these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v m protein , similar to the m proteins of other corona ##virus ##es , plays a pivotal role in virus assembly . the cy ##top ##las ##mic c - terminus domain of sar ##s - co ##v m protein was responsible for binding to nc protein . multiple regions of m protein interact ##ed with e and s proteins . a model for the interactions between sar ##s - co ##v m protein and other structural proteins is proposed . this study helps us better understand protein - protein interactions during viral assembly of sar ##s - co ##v . electronic supplementary material : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##11 ##37 ##3 - 00 ##8 - 92 ##7 ##8 - 3 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein is a major antigen in severe acute respiratory syndrome . it binds to the viral rna genome and forms the rib ##on ##uc ##le ##op ##rot ##ein core . the sar ##s - co ##v n protein has also been suggested to be involved in other important functions in the viral life cycle . here we show that the n protein consists of two non - interacting structural domains , the n - terminal rna - binding domain ( rb ##d ) ( residues 45 – 181 ) and the c - terminal dime ##rization domain ( residues 248 – 365 ) ( dd ) , surrounded by flexible link ##ers . the c - terminal domain exists exclusively as a dime ##r in solution . the flexible link ##ers are intrinsic ##ally disorder ##ed and represent potential interaction sites with other protein and protein - rna partners . bio ##in ##form ##atics reveal that other corona ##virus n proteins could share the same modular organization . this study provides information on the domain structure partition of sar ##s - co ##v n protein and insights into the differing roles of structured and disorder ##ed regions in corona ##virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins .  
bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ( sl - co ##v ) has a genome organization almost identical to that of sar ##s - co ##v , but the n - terminus of the spike ( s ) proteins , which interact ##s with host receptor and is a major target of neutral ##izing antibodies against co ##vs , of the two viruses has only 63 – 64 % sequence identity . although there have been reports studying the overall im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of s ( sl ) , knowledge on the precise location of im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant deter ##mina ##nts for s ( sl ) is still lacking . in this study , using a series of truncated expressed s ( sl ) fragments and s ( sl ) specific mouse sera , we identified two im ##mun ##ogenic deter ##mina ##nts for s ( sl ) . importantly , one of the two regions seems to be located in a region not shared by known im ##mun ##ogenic deter ##mina ##nts of the s ( sar ##s ) . this finding will be of potential use in future monitoring of sl - co ##v infection in bats and spill ##over animals and in development of more effective vaccine to cover broad protection against this new group of corona ##virus ##es .  
a novel corona ##virus was identified as the cause for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the complete sequence of sar ##s genome has provided an opportunity for the development of molecular diagnostic ass ##ays . to restrain further outbreak of sar ##s , the world health organization has posted several pairs of polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) prime ##rs for early diagnosis and urged more research to be done on pc ##r protocols . here we report a strategy for the de novo synthesis of pc ##r template ##s compliment ##ary to the sar ##s virus genome , which has the advantage of working on pc ##r template ##s without concern about viral infection and also has the advantage that it can be used by those who do not have access to the sar ##s virus . this highly efficient and safe strategy for obtaining sar ##s gene fragments is useful for the development of pc ##r ass ##ays , as well as for the preparation of reliable positive controls for pc ##r testing kits .  
the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ( pro ) ) of middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has pro ##te ##ol ##ytic , de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating , and dei ##sg ##yla ##ting activities . the latter two are involved in the suppression of the anti ##vira ##l innate immune response of the host cell . to contribute to an understanding of this process , we present here the x - ray crystal structure of a complex between mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) and human u ##bi ##qui ##tin ( u ##b ) that is devoid of any co ##valent link ##age between the two proteins . five regions of the pl ( pro ) bind to two areas of the u ##b . the c - terminal five residues of u ##b , r ##lr ##gg , are similar to the p ##5 – p ##1 residues of the poly ##pro ##tein substrates of the pl ( pro ) and are responsible for the major part of the interaction between the two macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s . through sited ##ire ##cted mu ##tage ##nes ##is , we demonstrate that conserved as ##p ##16 ##5 and non - conserved as ##p ##16 ##4 are important for the catalytic activities of mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) . the enzyme appears not to be opt ##imi ##zed for catalytic efficiency ; thus , replacement of ph ##e ##26 ##9 by ty ##r leads to increased pep ##ti ##do ##ly ##tic and de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activities . u ##bi ##qui ##tin binding by mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) involves remarkable differences compared to the corresponding complex with sar ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) . the structure and the mutation ##al study help understand common and unique features of the de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activity of mer ##s - co ##v pl ( pro ) . electronic supplementary material : supplementary material is available for this article at 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##12 ##25 ##0 - 01 ##6 - 37 ##42 - 4 and is accessible for authorized users .  
a group of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##v ) have been identified in horseshoe bats . despite sl - co ##vs and sar ##s - co ##v share identical genome structure and high - level sequence similarity , sl - co ##v does not bind to the same cellular receptor as for sar ##s - co ##v and the n - terminus of the s proteins only share 64 % amino acid identity , suggesting there are fundamental differences between these two groups of corona ##virus ##es . to gain insight into the basis of this difference , we established a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus system expressing the s protein from sl - co ##v ( ra ##d - r ##p ##3 - s ) to investigate its immune characterization . our results showed that im ##mun ##ized mice generated strong humor ##al immune responses against the sl - co ##v s protein . moreover , a strong cellular immune response demonstrated by elevated if ##n - γ and il - 6 levels was also observed in these mice . however , the induced antibody from these mice had weaker cross - reaction with the sar ##s - co ##v s protein , and did not neutral ##ize hiv pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v s protein . these results demonstrated that the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of the sl - co ##v s protein is distinct from that of sar ##s - co ##v , which may cause the im ##mun ##ological differences between human sar ##s - co ##v and bat sl - co ##v . furthermore , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus could serve as a potential vaccine candidate against bat sl - co ##v infection .  
corona ##virus ##es have been closely related with mankind for thousands of years . community ##ac ##qui ##red human corona ##virus ##es have long been recognized to cause common cold . however , zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es are now becoming more a global concern with the discovery of highly pathogen ##ic severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ##es causing severe respiratory diseases . infections by these emerging human corona ##virus ##es are characterized by less robust inter ##fer ##on production . treatment of patients with rec ##om ##bina ##nt inter ##fer ##on regime ##n promises beneficial outcomes , suggesting that compromised inter ##fer ##on expression might contribute at least partially to the severity of disease . the mechanisms by which corona ##virus ##es evade host innate anti ##vira ##l response are under intense investigations . this review focuses on the fierce arms race between host innate anti ##vira ##l immunity and emerging human corona ##virus ##es . particularly , the host pathogen recognition receptors and the signal trans ##duction pathways to mount an effective anti ##vira ##l response against sar ##s and mer ##s corona ##virus infection are discussed . on the other hand , the counter - measures evolved by sar ##s and mer ##s corona ##virus ##es to ci ##rc ##um ##vent host defense are also di ##sse ##cted . with a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between host and corona ##virus ##es , it is hoped that insights on the pathogen ##esis of newly - identified highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es and new strategies in anti ##vira ##l development can be derived .

corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) can cause highly prevalent diseases in humans and animals . the fatal outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) highlights the threat posed by this unique virus subfamily . however , no specific drugs have been approved to treat co ##v - associated diseases to date . the co ##v pro ##tea ##ses , which play pivotal roles in viral gene expression and replication through a highly complex cascade involving the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s , are attractive targets for drug design . this review sum ##mar ##izes the recent advances in biological and structural studies , together with the development of inhibitors targeting co ##v pro ##tea ##ses , particularly main pro ##tea ##ses ( m ( pro ) s ) , which could help develop effective treatments to prevent co ##v infection .

it remains challenging to develop animal models of lung infection and severe pneumonia by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corn ##avi ##rus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) without high level of containment . this inevitably hind ##ers understanding of virus ##hos ##t interaction and development of appropriate counter ##me ##as ##ures . here we report that intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation of sub ##let ##hal doses of mu ##rine corona ##virus mouse hepatitis virus a - 59 ( m ##h ##v - a ##59 ) , a he ##pati ##c and ne ##uron ##al tr ##op ##ic corona ##virus , can induce acute pneumonia and severe lung injuries in c ##57 ##bl / 6 mice . inflammatory le ##uk ##oc ##yte in ##filtration ##s , hem ##or ##rh ##ages and fi ##bro ##sis of al ##ve ##olar walls can be observed 2 – 11 days after m ##h ##v - a ##59 infection . this path ##ological manifestation is associated with dramatic ##al elevation of tissue ip - 10 and if ##n - γ and moderate increase of tn ##f - α and il - 1 ##β , but inability of anti - viral type i inter ##fer ##on response . these results suggest that intra ##nas ##al infection of m ##h ##v - a ##59 would serve as a sur ##rogate mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a virus that manifest ##s itself in viral infection with fever , cough , short ##ness of breath , renal failure and severe acute pneumonia , which often result in a fatal outcome . mer ##s - co ##v has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact . transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is ir ##red ##eem ##able with present technology . genetic studies on mer ##s - co ##v have shown that or ##f ##1 ##ab en ##codes replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s and play a foremost role in viral infection . therefore , or ##f ##1 ##ab replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein may be used as a suitable target for disease control . viral activity can be controlled by rna interference ( rna ##i ) technology , a leading method for post transcription ##al gene si ##len ##cing in a sequence - specific manner . however , there is a genetic inc ##ons ##iste ##ncy in different viral isolate ##s ; it is a great challenge to design potential rna ##i ( mir ##na and sir ##na ) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously . in the current study , four effective mir ##na and five sir ##na molecules for si ##len ##cing of nine different strains of mer ##s - co ##v were rational ##ly designed and co ##rro ##bor ##ated using computational methods , which might lead to knock ##down the activity of virus . sir ##na and mir ##na molecules were predicted against or ##f ##1 ##ab gene of different strains of mer ##s - co ##v as effective candidate using computational methods . thus , this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of anti ##vira ##l rna molecule for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v , at gen ##omic level .  
purpose : to describe the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in toronto , its impact on an ##esthesia practice and the infection control guidelines adopted to manage patients in the operating room ( or ) and to provide emergency int ##uba ##tion outside the or . clinical features : the sar ##s outbreak in toronto was the result of a single index patient . the ca ##usa ##tive virus , sar ##s - co ##v , is moderately con ##tag ##ious , and is spread by droplets and contact . the virus gains access to host through the mu ##cos ##a of the respiratory tract and the eyes . it can affect both healthy and compromised patients . the use of several pre ##ca ##ution ##ary measures such as go ##ggles , gloves , gown ##s and face ##mas ##ks and the application of various infection control strategies designed to minimize the spread of the virus are discussed . conclusion : in containing the spread of sar ##s , vi ##gil ##ance and strict infection control are important . this results in the red ##is ##co ##very of standards of infection control measures in daily an ##esthesia practice .  
the newly emerging human pathogen , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , contains a macro domain in the highly conserved n - terminal region of non - structural protein 3 . intense research has shown that macro domains bind ad ##p - rib ##ose and other derivatives , but it still remains int ##ang ##ible about their exact function . in this study we report the preliminary structural analysis through solution nm ##r spectroscopy of the mer ##s - co ##v macro domain . the near complete nm ##r assignments of mer ##s - co ##v macro domain provide the basis for subsequent structural and bio ##chemical investigation in the context of protein function .  
the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays an essential role in the extensive pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the viral poly ##pro ##tein ##s ( pp ##1 ##a and pp ##1 ##ab ) , and it is an important target for anti - sar ##s drug development . sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) is composed of a catalytic n - terminal domain and an α - he ##lica ##l c - terminal domain linked by a long loop . even though the n - terminal domain of sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) adopt ##s a similar ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like fold as that of pic ##ona ##virus 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se , the extra c - terminal domain is required for sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) to be en ##zy ##matic ##ally active . here , we reported the nm ##r assignments of the sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) n - terminal domain alone , which are essential for its solution structure determination .  
in order to establish the eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cell lines for ind ##ucible control of sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene expression . the rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d of pt ##re - tight - sar ##s - n was constructed by using the pl ##as ##mi ##d p ##8 ##s as the pc ##r template which contains a cd ##na clone covering the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene of sar ##s - co ##v hk ##u - 39 ##44 ##9 . restriction enzymes digest ##ion and sequence analysis indicated the rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d of pt ##re - tight - sar ##s - n contained the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene with the opt ##imi ##zed nu ##cle ##otide sequence which will improve the translation efficiency . positive cell clones were selected by cot ##ran ##sf ##ect ##ing pt ##re - tight - sar ##s - n with the linear marker pp ##ur to b ##h ##k - 21 te ##t - on cells in the presence of pu ##rom ##y ##cin . a set of double - stable eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cell lines ( b ##h ##k - te ##t - sar ##s - n ) with ind ##ucible control of the sar ##s - co ##v ne ##uc ##le ##oca ##ps ##id gene expression was identified by using sd ##s - page and western - b ##lot analysis . the expression of sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein was tightly regulated by the varying concentration of do ##x ##cy ##cl ##ine in the constructed double - stable cell line . the constructed b ##h ##k - te ##t - sar ##s - n cell strains will facilitate the rescue of sar ##s - co ##v in vitro and the further reverse genetic research of sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes eight accessory proteins , the functions of which are not yet fully understood . sar ##s - co ##v protein 6 ( p ##6 ) is one of the previously studied accessory proteins that have been documented to enhance viral replication and suppress host inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) signaling pathways . through yeast two - hybrid screening , we identified eight potential cellular p ##6 - interacting proteins from a human sp ##leen cd ##na library . for further investigation , we targeted the if ##n signaling pathway - media ##ting protein , n - my ##c ( and stat ) interact ##or ( nmi ) . its interaction with p ##6 was confirmed within cells . the results showed that p ##6 can promote the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - dependent pro ##te ##osomal degradation of nmi . this study revealed a new mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v p ##6 in limiting the if ##n signaling to promote sar ##s - co ##v survival in host cells .  
background : the sar ##s outbreak served to test both local and international outbreak management and risk communication practices . purpose : the study compares sar ##s knowledge , perceptions , behaviors , and information between finn ##s and the dutch during the sar ##s outbreak in 2003 . method : the participants of the study , who used a modified sar ##s psycho ##so ##cial research consortium survey , were drawn from internet panels in finland ( n = 308 ) and the netherlands ( n = 37 ##3 ) in june 2003 . multiple log ##istic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios ( with 95 % confidence intervals ) to compare finn ##s with the dutch for various levels of perceptions and behaviors . results : adjusted for age , education , and income , finn ##s were more likely to be knowledge ##able and worried about sar ##s as well as to have low perceived comparative sar ##s risk and poor personal efficacy beliefs about preventing sar ##s . finn ##s were also more likely than the dutch to have high confidence in physicians on sar ##s issues but less likely to have received information from the internet and have confidence in internet information . conclusions : the study shed light on how two european populations differed substantially regarding lay responses to sar ##s . understanding these differences is needed in formula ##ting and executing communication and outbreak management .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe - to - fatal pneumonia especially in patients with pre - existing conditions , such as smoking and chronic ob ##st ##ru ##ctive pulmonary disease ( cop ##d ) . mer ##s - co ##v transmission continues to be reported in the saudi arabian peninsula since its discovery in 2012 . however , it has rarely been epidemic outside the area except one large outbreak in south korea in may 2015 . the genome of the epidemic mer ##s - co ##v isolated from a korean patient revealed its homo ##logy to previously reported strains . mer ##s - co ##v en ##codes 5 accessory proteins and generally , they do not participate in the genome transcription and replication but rather are involved in viral eva ##sion of the host innate immune responses . here we report that or ##f ##8 ##b , an accessory protein of mer ##s - co ##v , strongly inhibit ##s both md ##a ##5 - and rig - i - mediated activation of inter ##fer ##on beta promoter activity while downstream signaling molecules were left largely unaffected . of note , md ##a ##5 protein levels were significantly down - regulated by or ##f ##8 ##b and co - expression of or ##f ##4 ##a and or ##f ##4 ##b . these novel findings will facilitate el ##uc ##ida ##tion of mechanisms of virus - encoded eva ##sion strategies , thus helping design rational ##e anti ##vira ##l counter ##me ##as ##ures against deadly mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a deadly infectious disease caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . inactivated sar ##s - co ##v has been explored as a vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v . however , safe and potent ad ##ju ##vant ##s , especially with more efficient and economical needle - free va ##cci ##nation are always needed more urgently in a pan ##de ##mic . the development of a safe and effective mu ##cos ##al ad ##ju ##vant and vaccine for prevention of emerge ##nt infectious diseases such as sar ##s will be an important advancement . pi ##ka , a stabilized derivative of poly ( i : c ) , was previously reported to be safe and potent as ad ##ju ##vant in mouse models . in the present study , we demonstrated that the intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l and intra ##nas ##al co - administration of inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine together with this improved poly ( i : c ) derivative induced strong anti - sar ##s - co ##v mu ##cos ##al and systemic humor ##al immune responses with neutral ##izing activity against pseudo ##type ##d virus . although intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l im ##mun ##ization of inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutral ##izing activity in serum as well as in mu ##cos ##al sites , co - administration of inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine with pi ##ka as ad ##ju ##vant could induce a much higher neutral ##izing activity . when intra ##nas ##al im ##mun ##ization was used , pi ##ka was ob ##liga ##tori ##ly for inducing neutral ##izing activity in serum as well as in mu ##cos ##al sites and was correlated with both mu ##cos ##al i ##ga and mu ##cos ##al i ##gg response . overall , pi ##ka could be a good mu ##cos ##al ad ##ju ##vant candidate for inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine for use in possible future pan ##de ##mic .  
the health profession faces a new challenge with the emergence of a novel viral disease severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a form of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia caused by a corona ##virus termed sar ##s - co ##v . this highly infectious disease has spread through 32 countries , in ##fect ##ing more than 8 , 400 patients with over 79 ##0 deaths in just over 6 months . over one quarter of those infected were un ##sus ##pe ##cting healthcare workers . the major transmission mode of sar ##s - corona ##virus appears to be through drop ##let spread with other minor subsidiary modes of transmission such as close contact and f ##omi ##tes although air borne transmission has not been ruled out . there is as yet no definitive treatment protocol . although the peak period of the outbreak is likely to have passed and the risk of sar ##s in the uk is therefore assessed to be low , the world health organisation has asked all countries to remain vi ##gil ##ant lest sar ##s re - emerges . recent laboratory acquired cases of sar ##s reported from taiwan and beijing , china are a testimony to this risk . until reliable diagnostic tests , vaccine and medications are available , control of sar ##s outbreak ##s depends on close surveillance , early identification of index cases , quick isolation of carriers and effective infection control and public health measures .  
sar ##s - co ##v ( the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ) was reported as a novel virus member in the corona ##virus family , which was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome . corona ##virus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing leader sequence in the transcript ##s when initiating transcription from the genome . therefore , we clone ##d the leader sequence from sar ##s - co ##v ( b ##j ##01 ) , which is identical to that identified from sar ##s - co ##v ( hk ##u - 39 ##8 ##49 ) , and constructed specific sir ##na targeting the leader sequence . using e ##gf ##p and rf ##p reporter genes fused with the clone ##d sar ##s - co ##v leader sequence , we demonstrated that the sir ##na targeting the leader sequence decreased the mrna abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293 ##t cells . by stab ##ly expressing the sir ##na in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , we provided data that the sir ##na could effectively and specifically decrease the mrna abundance of sar ##s - co ##v genes as analyzed by rt - pc ##r and northern b ##lot . our data indicated that the sir ##na targeting the leader sequence inhibit ##ed the replication of sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro e ##6 cells by si ##len ##cing gene expression . we further demonstrated , via transient trans ##fect ##ion experiments , that the sir ##na targeting the leader sequence had a much stronger inhibitor ##y effect on sar ##s - co ##v replication than the sir ##nas targeting the spike gene or the anti ##sen ##se ol ##igo ##de ##ox ##yn ##uc ##le ##otide ##s did . this report provides evidence that targeting leader sequence using sir ##na could be a powerful tool in inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
many new infectious diseases in humans have been derived from animal sources in the past 20 years . some are highly con ##tag ##ious and fatal . va ##cci ##nation may not be available and anti ##vira ##l drugs are not effective enough . infectious control is important in clinical medicine and in op ##ht ##hal ##mology . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , as an example , is a highly con ##tag ##ious respiratory disease that has recently been reported in asia , north america , and europe . within a matter of weeks , the outbreak has evolved to become a global health threat and more than 30 countries have been af ##flict ##ed with a novel corona ##virus strain ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that is the ae ##ti ##olo ##gic agent of sar ##s . the primary route of transmission of sar ##s appears involving close person - to - person contact through droplets . op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logists may be particularly susceptible to the infection as routine op ##ht ##hal ##mic examinations like direct op ##ht ##hal ##mos ##co ##py and slit - lamp examination are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor – patient contact . being the op ##ht ##hal ##mology department of the only hospital in the world that has just gone through the largest outbreak of sar ##s , we would like to share our strategy , measures , and experiences of preventing contracting or spreading of sar ##s infection as an infection control model . sar ##s is one of the many viruses against which personnel will need protecting in an op ##ht ##hal ##mic setting . the experiences attained and the measures established might also apply to other infectious conditions spreading by droplets such as the av ##ian influenza with h ##5 ##n ##1 .  
the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a major vi ##rion structural protein . in this study , two ep ##ito ##pes ( n ##1 and n ##2 ) of the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v were predicted by bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis . after im ##mun ##ization with two peptide ##s , the peptide ##s - specific antibodies were isolated from the im ##mun ##ized rabbits . the further experiments demonstrated that n ##1 peptide - induced poly ##cl ##onal antibodies had a high affinity to bind to e . coli expressed n protein of sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , it was confirmed that n ##1 peptide - specific i ##gg antibodies were detect ##able in the sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) patients . the results indicated that an ep ##ito ##pe of the n protein has been identified and n protein specific abs were produced by peptide im ##mun ##ization , which will be useful for the study of sar ##s - co ##v .  
a novel human corona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has caused outbreak ##s of a sar ##s - like illness with high case fatal ##ity rate . the reports of its person - to - person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pan ##de ##mic potential . here we character ##ize the six - helix bundle fusion core structure of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein s ##2 subunit by x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy and bio ##physical analysis . we find that two peptide ##s , hr ##1 ##p and hr ##2 ##p , spanning residues 99 ##8 – 103 ##9 in hr ##1 and 125 ##1 – 128 ##6 in hr ##2 domains , respectively , can form a stable six - helix bundle fusion core structure , suggesting that mer ##s - co ##v enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism . hr ##2 ##p can effectively inhibit mer ##s - co ##v replication and its spike protein - mediated cell – cell fusion . introduction of hydro ##phi ##lic residues into hr ##2 ##p results in significant improvement of its stability , sol ##ub ##ility and anti ##vira ##l activity . therefore , the hr ##2 ##p analogue ##s have good potential to be further developed into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating mer ##s - co ##v infection . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nc ##om ##ms ##40 ##6 ##7 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
aim : the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is still a threat because the ca ##usa ##tive agent remaining in animal reservoirs is not fully understood , and sporadic cases continue to be reported . developing high ti ##ters of anti - sar ##s hyper ##im ##mun ##e g ##lo ##bu ##lin to provide an alternative pathway for emerge ##nt future prevention and treatment of sar ##s . methods : sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) f ##6 ##9 ( a ##y ##31 ##39 ##0 ##6 ) and z ##2 - y ##3 ( a ##y ##39 ##49 ##8 ##9 ) were isolated and identified from 2 different cantonese onset sar ##s patients . im ##mun ##ogen was prepared from sar ##s - co ##v f ##6 ##9 strain . six health horses were im ##mun ##ized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific i ##gg and neutral ##izing antibodies using indirect enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay and a micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization test . sera were collected in large amounts at the peak , where i ##gg was pre ##ci ##pit ##ated using am ##monium sul ##phate and subsequently digest ##ed with pepsi ##n . the product was then pu ##rified using an ##ion - exchange ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy to obtain f ( ab ′ ) ( 2 ) fragments . results : the specific i ##gg and neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters peaked at approximately week 7 after the first im ##mun ##ization , with a maximum value of 1 : 142 ##10 . the sera collected at the peak were then pu ##rified . fragment of approximately 15 g f ( ab ′ ) ( 2 ) was obtained from 1 litre anti ##ser ##um and the purity was above 90 % with the ti ##ter of 1 : 512 ##0 , which could neutral ##ize the other strain ( sar ##s - co ##v z ##2 - y ##3 ) as well . conclusion : this research provides a viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of sar ##s corona ##virus infection with e ##quin ##e hyper ##im ##mun ##e g ##lo ##bu ##lin , with the purpose of combat ##ing any resurgence of sar ##s .  
spike protein is one of the major structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus . it is essential for the interaction of the vi ##rons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral en ##vel ##op with host cell membrane to allow infection . some spike proteins of corona ##virus , such as m ##h ##v , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , ai ##b ##v and bc ##ov , are pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally cl ##ea ##ved into two subunit ##s , s ##1 and s ##2 . in contrast , t ##g ##v , fi ##p ##v and hc ##ov - 229 ##e are not . many studies have shown that the cleavage of spike protein seriously affects its function . in order to investigate the mat ##uration and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the s protein of sar ##s co ##v , we generated s ##1 and s ##2 subunit specific antibodies ( abs ) as well as n , e and 3 ##cl protein - specific abs . our results showed that the antibodies could efficiently and specifically bind to their corresponding proteins from e . coli expressed or l ##ys ##ate of sar ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro - e ##6 cells by western b ##lot analysis . furthermore , the anti - s ##1 and s ##2 abs were proved to be capable of binding to sar ##s co ##v under electron microscope observation . when s ##2 ab was used to perform immune precipitation with l ##ys ##ate of sar ##s - co ##v infected cells , a cl ##ea ##ved s ##2 fragment was detected with s ##2 - specific mab by western b ##lot analysis . the data demonstrated that the cleavage of s protein was observed in the l ##ys ##ate , indicating that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of s protein is present in host cells .  
while severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was initially thought to enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane , more recent evidence suggests that virus entry may also involve end ##oc ##yt ##osis . we have found that sar ##s - co ##v enters cells via ph - and receptor - dependent end ##oc ##yt ##osis . treatment of cells with either sar ##s - co ##v spike protein or spike - bearing pseudo ##virus ##es resulted in the trans ##lo ##cation of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the functional receptor of sar ##s - co ##v , from the cell surface to end ##oso ##mes . in addition , the spike - bearing pseudo ##virus ##es and early end ##oso ##me antigen 1 were found to col ##oca ##li ##ze in end ##oso ##mes . further analyses using specific end ##oc ##ytic pathway inhibitors and dominant - negative eps ##15 as well as cave ##olin - 1 col ##oca ##lization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a cl ##ath ##rin - and cave ##ola ##e - independent mechanism . moreover , cho ##les ##terol - and sp ##hing ##oli ##pid - rich lip ##id raft micro ##dom ##ains in the plasma membrane , which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways , were shown to be involved in virus entry . end ##oc ##ytic entry of sar ##s - co ##v may expand the cellular range of sar ##s - co ##v infection , and our findings here contribute to the understanding of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , providing new information for anti - viral drug research . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / cr . 2008 . 15 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
aim : to character ##ize en ##zy ##matic activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) and its four site - directed mutants . methods : based on the flu ##orescence resonance energy transfer ( fr ##et ) principle using 5 - [ ( 2 ′ - amino ##eth ##yl ) - amino ] nap ##ht ##hel ##enes ##ulf ##onic acid ( ed ##ans ) and 4 - [ [ 4 - ( dime ##thy ##lam ##ino ) ph ##en ##yl ] az ##o ] benz ##oic acid ( da ##bc ##yl ) as the energy transfer pair , one flu ##oro ##genic substrate was designed for the evaluation of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity . results : the kinetic parameters of the flu ##oro ##genic substrate have been determined as k ( m ) = 404 μ ##mo ##l · l ( − ##1 ) , k ( cat ) = 1 . 08 min ( − ##1 ) , and k ( cat ) / k ( m ) = 2 . 7 mm ##ol ( − ##1 ) · l · min ( − ##1 ) . sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) showed substantial ph and temperature - triggered activity switches , and site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is analysis of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) revealed that substitution ##s of his ( 41 ) , cy ##s ( 145 ) , and his ( 163 ) resulted in complete loss of en ##zy ##matic activity , while replacement of met ( 162 ) with ala caused strongly increased activity . conclusion : this present work has provided valuable information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . this fr ##et - based ass ##ay might supply an ideal approach for the exploration sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) put ##ative inhibitors .  
background : corona ##virus can cross the species barrier and in ##fect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in china . in this study , a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non - human - origin corona ##virus for early warning . methods : the spike protein sequences of 266 ##6 corona ##virus ##es were collected from 2019 novel corona ##virus resource ( 2019 ##nco ##vr ) database of china national gen ##omics data center on jan 29 , 2020 . a total of 50 ##7 human - origin viruses were regarded as positive samples , whereas 215 ##9 non - human - origin viruses were regarded as negative . to capture the key information of the spike protein , three feature encoding algorithms ( amino acid composition , aa ##c ; parallel correlation - based pseudo - amino - acid composition , pc - ps ##ea ##ac and g - gap dip ##ept ##ide composition , g ##ga ##p ) were used to train 41 random forest models . the optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multi ##dim ##ens ##ional scaling method , which was used to explore the pattern of human corona ##virus . results : the 10 - fold cross - validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the g ##ga ##p ( g = 3 ) feature . the predict ##ive model achieved the maximum acc of 98 . 18 % coupled with the matthews correlation coefficient ( mcc ) of 0 . 96 ##38 . seven clusters for human corona ##virus ##es ( 229 ##e , nl ##6 ##3 , o ##c ##43 , hk ##u ##1 , mer ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) were found . the cluster for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was very close to that for sar ##s - co ##v , which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor ( ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ii ) . the big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously . the smooth distance curve for sar ##s - co ##v suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual . conclusions : the optimal feature ( g ##ga ##p , g = 3 ) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple , fast and large - scale manner . the study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of corona ##virus in the field .  
spike ( s ) proteins of corona ##virus ##es , including the corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , associate with cellular receptors to media ##te infection of their target cells ( 1 , 2 ) . here we identify a metal ##lo ##pe ##pt ##ida ##se , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) ( 3 , 4 ) , isolated from sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) - per ##missive ve ##ro e ##6 cells , that efficiently binds the s ##1 domain of the sar ##s - co ##v s protein . we found that a soluble form of ace ##2 , but not of the related enzyme ace ##1 , blocked association of the s ##1 domain with ve ##ro e ##6 cells . 293 ##t cells trans ##fect ##ed with ace ##2 , but not those trans ##fect ##ed with human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus - 1 receptors , formed multi ##nu ##cle ##ated sync ##yt ##ia with cells expressing s protein . furthermore , sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##d efficiently on ace ##2 - trans ##fect ##ed but not mock - trans ##fect ##ed 293 ##t cells . finally , anti - ace ##2 but not anti - ace ##1 antibody blocked viral replication on ve ##ro e ##6 cells . together our data indicate that ace ##2 is a functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nature ##0 ##21 ##45 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
a novel corona ##virus has been recently identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak that has accounted for more than 800 ##0 infected people worldwide . this review will discuss current knowledge on corona ##virus replication , pathogen ##esis , evolution , and vaccine strategies , as well as the most recent findings on sar ##s corona ##virus .  
the newly emerge ##nt middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) can cause severe pulmonary disease in humans ( 1 , 2 ) , representing the second example of a highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus , the first being sar ##s - co ##v ( 3 ) . cd ##26 ( also known as dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 , d ##pp ##4 ) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for mer ##s - co ##v ( 4 ) . the engagement of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein with cd ##26 media ##tes viral attachment to host cells and virus – cell fusion , thereby initiating infection . here we del ##ine ##ate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and its complex with cd ##26 . furthermore , binding between the rb ##d and cd ##26 is measured using real - time surface pl ##as ##mon resonance with a di ##sso ##ciation constant of 16 . 7 nm . the viral rb ##d is composed of a core sub ##dom ##ain homo ##log ##ous to that of the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein , and a unique strand - dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades iv and v of the cd ##26 β - propeller . the atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein – protein contact mediated mainly by hydro ##phi ##lic residues . sequence alignment indicates , among beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , a possible structural conservation for the region homo ##log ##ous to the mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d core , but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus - specific pathogen ##esis such as receptor recognition . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nature ##12 ##32 ##8 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has recently emerged as a new human disease , resulting globally in 435 deaths from 6 , 234 probable cases ( as of 3 may 2003 ) . here we provide proof from experimental infection of cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca fa ##sc ##icular ##is ) that the newly discovered sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sc ##v ) is the ae ##ti ##ological agent of this disease . our understanding of the ae ##ti ##ology of sar ##s will ex ##ped ##ite the development of diagnostic tests , anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies and vaccines , and may allow a more con ##cise case definition for this emerging disease . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / 42 ##32 ##40 ##a ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreak ##s of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , but concerns remain over the possibility of future rec ##ur ##rence ##s . finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority . here , we show that a dna vaccine encoding the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of the sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s t cell and neutral ##izing antibody responses , as well as protective immunity , in a mouse model . alternative forms of s were anal ##yse ##d by dna im ##mun ##ization . these expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by cd ##4 and cd ##8 cells , as well as significant antibody ti ##tres , measured by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . moreover , antibody responses in mice va ##cci ##nated with an expression vector encoding a form of s that includes its trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain eli ##cite ##d neutral ##izing antibodies . viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice va ##cci ##nated with these s pl ##as ##mi ##d dna expression vectors , and protection was mediated by a humor ##al but not a t - cell - dependent immune mechanism . gene - based va ##cci ##nation for the sar ##s - co ##v eli ##cit ##s effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nature ##0 ##24 ##6 ##3 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
during several months of 2003 , a newly identified illness termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) spread rapidly through the world ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was identified as the sar ##s pathogen ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) , which triggered severe pneumonia and acute , often lethal , lung failure ( 8 ) . moreover , among infected individuals influenza such as the spanish flu ( 9 , 10 ) and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses ( 11 , 12 ) have caused high lethal ##ity resulting from acute lung failure ( 13 ) . in cell lines , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been identified as a potential sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( 14 ) . the high lethal ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v infections , its enormous economic and social impact , fears of renewed outbreak ##s as well as the potential mis ##use of such viruses as bio ##logic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v . here we provide the first genetic proof that ace ##2 is a crucial sar ##s - co ##v receptor in vivo . sar ##s - co ##v infections and the spike protein of the sar ##s - co ##v reduce ace ##2 expression . notably , injection of sar ##s - co ##v spike into mice worse ##ns acute lung failure in vivo that can be at ##ten ##uated by blocking the ren ##in - ang ##iot ##ens ##in pathway . these results provide a molecular explanation why sar ##s - co ##v infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for sar ##s and possibly other respiratory disease viruses . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nm ##12 ##6 ##7 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
passive ser ##oth ##era ##py can con ##fer immediate protection against micro ##bial infection , but methods to rapidly generate human neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies are not yet available . we have developed an improved method for epstein - barr virus transformation of human b cells . we used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection and to isolate mono ##cl ##onal antibodies specific for different viral proteins , including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutral ##izing activity ranging from 10 ( − ##8 ) m to 10 ( − ##11 ) m . one such antibody con ##fers protection in vivo in a mouse model of sar ##s - co ##v infection . these results show that it is possible to inter ##rogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutral ##izing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nm ##10 ##80 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .

severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was caused by a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed animal corona ##virus that exploited opportunities provided by ' wet markets ' in southern china to adapt to become a virus readily trans ##missible between humans . hospitals and international travel proved to be ' amplifiers ' that permitted a local outbreak to achieve global dimensions . in this review we will discuss the substantial scientific progress that has been made towards understanding the virus — sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) — and the disease . we will also highlight the progress that has been made towards developing vaccines and the ##ra ##pies the concert ##ed and coordinated response that contained sar ##s is a triumph for global public health and provides a new paradigm for the detection and control of future emerging infectious disease threats .  
data concerning the transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in pau ##cis ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic patients are lacking . we report an italian pau ##cis ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case of corona ##virus disease 2019 with multiple biological samples positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . this case was detected using the world health organization protocol on cases and contact investigation . current discharge criteria and the impact of extra - pulmonary sar ##s - co ##v - 2 samples are discussed .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by infection of a previously und ##es ##cr ##ibe ##d corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . l - sign , encoded by cl ##ec ##4 ##m ( also known as cd ##20 ##9 ##l ) , is a sar ##s - co ##v binding receptor that has poly ##morphism in its extra ##cellular neck region encoded by the tandem repeat domain in ex ##on 4 . our genetic risk association study shows that individuals homo ##zy ##go ##us for cl ##ec ##4 ##m tandem repeats are less susceptible to sar ##s infection . l - sign is expressed in both non - sar ##s and sar ##s - co ##v – infected lung . compared with cells het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us for l - sign , cells homo ##zy ##go ##us for l - sign show higher binding capacity for sar ##s - co ##v , higher pro ##tea ##some - dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection . thus , homo ##zy ##gos ##ity for l - sign plays a protective role during sar ##s infection . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / ng ##16 ##9 ##8 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
in humans , infections with the human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) strains hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 usually result in mild , self - limiting upper respiratory tract infections , such as the common cold . by contrast , the co ##vs responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , which were discovered in hong kong , china , in 2003 , and in saudi arabia in 2012 , respectively , have received global attention over the past 12 years owing to their ability to cause community and health - care - associated outbreak ##s of severe infections in human populations . these two viruses pose major challenges to clinical management because there are no specific anti ##vira ##l drugs available . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , vi ##rol ##ogy , clinical features and current treatment strategies of sar ##s and mer ##s , and discuss the discovery and development of new virus - based and host - based therapeutic options for co ##v infections . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nr ##d . 2015 . 37 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
at the end of 2002 , the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) were reported , and in the following year , sar ##s resulted in considerable mortality and mor ##bid ##ity worldwide . sar ##s is caused by a novel species of corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and is the most severe corona ##virus - mediated human disease that has been described so far . on the basis of similarities with other corona ##virus infections , sar ##s might , in part , be immune mediated . as discussed in this review , studies of animals that are infected with other corona ##virus ##es indicate that excessive and sometimes d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated responses by macro ##pha ##ges and other pro - inflammatory cells might be particularly important in the pathogen ##esis of disease that is caused by infection with these viruses . it is hoped that lessons from such studies will help us to understand more about the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s in humans and to prevent or control outbreak ##s of sar ##s in the future .  
the 114 - day epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) swept 29 countries , affected a reported 8 , 09 ##8 people , left 77 ##4 patients dead and almost para ##ly ##sed the asian economy . aggressive qu ##aran ##tine measures , possibly aided by rising summer temperatures , successfully terminated the first eruption of sar ##s and provided at least a temporal break , which allows us to consolidate what we have learned so far and plan for the future . here , we review the gen ##omics of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , its ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , antigen ##ic structure , immune response and potential therapeutic interventions should the sar ##s epidemic flare up again .  
in 2012 a new viral emerge ##nt human disease appeared in the middle east . this entity was named mer ##s for ’ middle east respiratory syndrome ’ . by january 9 , 2014 , the disease had already struck 178 persons of whom 75 died from respiratory failure and dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . as the new disease was very similar to the deadly sar ##s ( 2002 – 2003 ) and since it was provoked by a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , chi ##rop ##tera were first suspected to be at the origin of this infection . more ##ver , recent studies performed in saudi arabia showed that one individual of the bat tap ##ho ##zo ##us per ##for ##atus harbor ##ed a short nu ##cle ##otide segment identical to the homo ##log ##ous segment present in the viral strain isolated from the index - case of the epidemic . in addition , many strains of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus more or less related to those responsible for the mer ##s disease in man have been isolated from bats in africa , asia and europe . however , another hypothesis was simultaneously proposed inc ##rim ##inating dr ##ome ##dar ##y ( camel ##us dr ##ome ##dar ##ius l . ) as a likely actor in the transmission to human beings of the disease . we then reviewed data relative to other viral zoo ##nosis in which dr ##ome ##dar ##y was possibly implicated . this led to the provisional conclusion that this large mammal might play a role in the dissemination of the mer ##s - co ##v , the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of the disease . this is based on ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data and results of several ser ##ological surveys in animals .  
the emergence in 2003 of a new corona ##virus ( co ##v ) responsible for the at ##yp ##ical pneumonia termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was a stark reminder that hit ##her ##to unknown viruses have the potential to cross species barriers to become new human pathogen ##s . here we describe the sar ##s - co ##v ' spike ' structure determined by single - particle cry ##o - em , along with the docked atomic structures of the receptor - binding domain and pre ##fusion core . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / ns ##mb ##11 ##23 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes sporadic zoo ##not ##ic disease and healthcare - associated outbreak ##s in human . mer ##s is often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and multi - organ failure ( 1 , 2 ) . the high incidence of renal failure in mer ##s is a unique clinical feature not often found in other human corona ##virus infections ( 3 , 4 ) . whether mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##s the kidney and how it triggers renal failure are not understood ( 5 , 6 ) . here , we demonstrated renal infection and ap ##op ##to ##tic induction by mer ##s - co ##v in human ex vivo organ culture and a non ##hum ##an primate model . high - through ##put analysis revealed that the cellular genes most significantly per ##tur ##bed by mer ##s - co ##v have previously been implicated in renal diseases . furthermore , mer ##s - co ##v induced ap ##op ##tosis through up ##re ##gul ##ation of sm ##ad ##7 and fi ##bro ##bla ##st growth factor 2 ( f ##gf ##2 ) expression in both kidney and lung cells . conversely , knock ##down of sm ##ad ##7 effectively inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v replication and protected cells from virus - induced cy ##top ##athic effects . we further demonstrated that hyper ##ex ##press ##ion of sm ##ad ##7 or f ##gf ##2 induced a strong ap ##op ##to ##tic response in kidney cells . common mar ##mos ##ets infected by mer ##s - co ##v developed ar ##ds and di ##sse ##minated infection in kidney ##s and other organs . sm ##ad ##7 and f ##gf ##2 expression were elevated in the lungs and kidney ##s of the infected animals . our results provide insights into the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v and host targets for treatment . supplementary information : the online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 103 ##8 / nmi ##cr ##ob ##iol . 2016 . 4 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness in humans , and no vaccines or specific treatments are available . infections are initiated via binding of the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to si ##alo ##side ##s and dip ##ept ##id ##yl - pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( the attachment and entry receptors , respectively ) . to understand mer ##s - co ##v engagement of si ##aly ##lated receptors , we determined the cry ##o - em structures of s in complex with 5 - n - ace ##ty ##l ne ##uram ##ini ##c acid , 5 - n - g ##ly ##col ##yl ne ##uram ##ini ##c acid , si ##aly ##l - lewis ( x ) , α ##2 , 3 - si ##aly ##l - n - ace ##ty ##l - lac ##tos ##amine and α ##2 , 6 - si ##aly ##l - n - ace ##ty ##l - lac ##tos ##amine at 2 . 7 – 3 . 0 a resolution . we show that recognition occurs via a conserved groove that is essential for mer ##s - co ##v s - mediated attachment to si ##alo ##side ##s and entry into human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . our data ill ##umi ##nate mer ##s - co ##v s si ##alo ##side specific ##ity and suggest that select ##ivity for α ##2 , 3 - linked over α ##2 , 6 - linked receptors results from enhanced interactions with the former class of ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des . this study provides a structural framework explaining mer ##s - co ##v attachment to si ##alo ##side receptors and identifies a site of potential vulnerability to inhibitors of viral entry .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerged infection that is caused by a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed virus – a novel corona ##virus designated as sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . from november 2002 to july 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was > 800 ##0 , with a mortality rate of close to 10 % . the mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co - mor ##bid ##ities . sar ##s has been defined using clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological criteria and cases are considered laboratory - confirmed if sar ##s corona ##virus is isolated , if antibody to sar ##s corona ##virus is detected , or a polymer ##ase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive . at the time of writing ( 24 may 2004 ) , no specific therapy has been recommended . a variety of treatments have been attempted , but there are no controlled data . most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad - spectrum anti ##mic ##ro ##bial ##s , supplemental oxygen , intra ##ven ##ous fluids , and other supportive measures . transmission of sar ##s is facilitated by close contact with patients with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic infection . the majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of sar ##s patients . since sar ##s - co ##v is con ##tag ##ious , measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure , and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts . this includes standard precautions ( hand hygiene ) , contact precautions ( gown ##s , go ##ggles , gloves ) and airborne precautions ( negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks ) . in light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003 – 4 in china , it seems possible that sar ##s will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future , and the screening of out ##patient ##s at risk for sar ##s may become part of the pneumonia evaluation .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) not only para ##ly ##sed economic activities in sar ##s - affected cities , it also affected sporting activities . sar ##s was identified in hong kong in late february 2003 and the who issued a global alert on 12 march , 2003 . the inc ##uba ##tion period of sar ##s is usually 4 – 6 days and patients commonly present with high fever ( temperature > 38 ##° ##c ) , dry cough , chill ##s and rig ##or , d ##ys ##p ##no ##ea and dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . although a specific anti ##vira ##l agent and vaccines for sar ##s are not available at the time of writing , a standard treatment protocol for sar ##s has been developed . the average mortality rate is about 16 % in hong kong . the corona ##virus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for sar ##s . transmission methods may , therefore , be similar for both these infections . transmission is possible when aero ##sol ##ised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host ’ s mu ##cous membrane , most commonly the nose , but also the mouth and eyes . with appropriate prevent ##ive measures to avoid contact with virus , the probability of infection is minimal . isolation of those who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected sar ##s patients and / or who have persistent fever will be the most effective and practical method of avoiding contact . maintaining personal hygiene and frequent hand washing can also reduce the risk of infection . using dil ##uted b ##lea ##ch ( 1 part b ##lea ##ch in 99 parts water ) to clean ##se training areas and equipment is also recommended . with proper event planning to conform with qu ##aran ##tine measures , special travel arrangements , facility ste ##ril ##isation and use of venues with good ventilation and filtering systems , sport competition can still proceed .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v , produced a scare when it appeared in 2003 in china and later quickly spread to other countries around the world . although it has since disappeared , its threat to human health remains . therefore , studies on the prevention and treatment of sar ##s are important for dealing with epidemic ##s of this and other infectious diseases . the most promising newly developed technology for intervention in sar ##s may be rna interference , an end ##ogen ##ous cellular process for the inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence - specific double - stranded rna ##s . numerous studies have reported the therapeutic potential of rna interference for the treatment of various human diseases ranging from cancers to infectious diseases such as hiv and hepatitis . to date , most studies on inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v replication using small interfering rna ##s ( sir ##nas ) have been conducted in cell lines in vitro . one study using sir ##nas to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v infection in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues demonstrated that sir ##nas were effective both prop ##hyl ##actic ##ally and therapeutic ##ally with no adverse effects in the animals . challenges remaining for the application of sir ##na in vivo for sar ##s prevention and treatment include the specific ##ity of the sir ##nas and the efficiency of delivery . however , with improvements in sir ##na design and delivery methods , rna interference has the potential to become another major weapon for combat ##ing dangerous infections due to viruses such as sar ##s - co ##v .  
aim : sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been confirmed as the pathogen for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the aim of our study was to construct a sensitive and specific real - time quantitative fluorescent ( q ##f ) reverse transcript ##ase ( rt ) - pc ##r method for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v rna . methods : stored blood specimens from 44 patients with confirmed sar ##s were used along with blood samples from two sets of controls , 30 healthy volunteers who had no contact with sar ##s patients , and 30 healthy doctors and nurses who had contact with sar ##s patients but were without symptoms of sar ##s . two pairs of prime ##rs were synthesized by the shanghai sang ##on company according to sar ##s - co ##v b ##j ##01 strain sequence ( a ##y ##27 ##8 ##48 ##8 ) , and then a pair of prime ##rs were designed and compared with a pair of prime ##rs published by who . results : using serial dil ##ution ##s of sar ##s - co ##v , the 44 blood samples from sar ##s patients specimens were tested . using a 0 . 01 % dil ##ution of sar ##s - co ##v , all 44 clinical samples tested positive in our ass ##ay . in comparison , using a 0 . 1 % dil ##ution of sar ##s - co ##v , 26 of the 44 samples tested positive using the who prime ##rs . in the q ##f - rt - pc ##r ass ##ay , there was a linear amp ##li ##fication from 100 copies to 10 ( 8 ) copies of the control rna per rt - pc ##r and at least 10 copies , and sometimes even 1 copy , of target rna tested positive in our ass ##ay . conclusion : the prime ##r we developed is sufficiently sensitive and specific to dia ##gno ##se sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v infections and for monitoring virus load .  
developing countries are at risk of import ##ing middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) from the middle east . hospitals in the middle east currently reporting the disease are staffed by immigrants . in the current hot spots for mer ##s co ##v a size ##able portion of the population is from other countries , but many of these countries have yet to detect any import ##ation of mer ##s co ##v . to assess the disease transmission in these countries , supplemental surveillance strategies are urgently needed beyond the currently recommended measures . a few strategies to address the situation are : ( i ) improving prepared ##ness with enhanced surveillance in particular regions ; ( ii ) targeting certain sentinel groups for surveillance in hot spots ; and ( iii ) limited use of ser ##os ##ur ##ve ##illa ##nce . recovered , immune patients can be employed to give patient care during outbreak ##s .  
since 2002 , beta corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) have caused three zoo ##not ##ic outbreak ##s , sar ##s - co ##v in 2002 – 2003 , mer ##s - co ##v in 2012 , and the newly emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in late 2019 . however , little is currently known about the biology of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein pseudo ##virus system , we confirm that human ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) is the receptor for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , find that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enters 293 / ha ##ce ##2 cells mainly through end ##oc ##yt ##osis , that pi ##k ##fy ##ve , t ##pc ##2 , and cat ##he ##ps ##in l are critical for entry , and that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein is less stable than sar ##s - co ##v s . poly ##cl ##onal anti - sar ##s s ##1 antibodies t ##6 ##2 inhibit entry of sar ##s - co ##v s but not sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s pseudo ##vir ##ions . further studies using recovered sar ##s and co ##vid - 19 patients ’ sera show limited cross - neutral ##ization , suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other . our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerging infectious disease that haunted the world from november 2002 to july 2003 . little is known about the biology and path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of the novel corona ##virus that causes sar ##s . the tissue and cellular distributions of corona ##vira ##l hypothetical and structural proteins in sar ##s were investigated . antibodies against the hypothetical ( sar ##s 3a , 3 ##b , 6 , 7 ##a and 9 ##b ) and structural proteins ( envelope , membrane , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike ) of the corona ##virus were generated from predicted antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes of each protein . the presence of these proteins were first verified in corona ##virus - infected ve ##ro e ##6 tissue culture model . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical studies on different human tissues , including a co ##hort of nine auto ##ps ##ies , two liver bio ##ps ##ies and int ##estinal bio ##ps ##ies of sar ##s patients , further confirmed the existence of corona ##vira ##l hypothetical and structural proteins in the cy ##top ##las ##m of p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and small int ##estinal surface enter ##ocytes in sar ##s patients . with this vast array of antibodies , no signal was observed in other cell types including those organs in which reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reactions were reported to be positive . structural proteins and the functional ##ly und ##efined hypothetical proteins were expressed in corona ##virus - infected cells with distinct expression pattern in different organs in sar ##s patients . these anti ##pe ##pt ##ide antibodies can be useful for the diagnosis of sar ##s at the tissue level .  
an early and accurate diagnostic ass ##ay for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is crucial for infection control . however , most of the diagnostic methods available today , such as real - time reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , require a second detection method for confirmation because they detect a single sequence region of the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . for sensitive and accurate early diagnosis , we report a novel ass ##ay system combining multiple ##x rt - pc ##r and a diagnostic gene chip to detect multiple virus - specific gen ##omic sequences of sar ##s - co ##v . with 53 clinical specimens , we successfully demonstrate that this technique offers not only a high - accuracy diagnosis for early sar ##s infection but also a semi ##qua ##nti ##tative ass ##ay .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sc ##v ) . the disease appeared in the gu ##ando ##ng province of southern china in 2002 . the epidemic affected > 84 ##22 patients and caused 90 ##8 deaths in 29 countries on 5 continents . several treatment mod ##ali ##ties were tried with limited success to treat sar ##s and a variety of experimental drugs are under development . type i inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns - α / β ) were suggested as potential candidates to treat sar ##s . several animal and human corona ##virus ##es , including sc ##v , were shown to be sensitive to if ##ns both in vitro and in vivo . a pilot clinical report showed effectiveness of if ##n - α for the treatment of sar ##s patients . this review sum ##mar ##ises anti ##vira ##l activities of if ##ns with special regard to sar ##s , and reviews the published clinical and experimental data describing the use of if ##ns for sar ##s .  
the novel corona ##virus infection ( co ##vid - 19 or corona ##virus disease 2019 ) that emerged from wu ##han , hub ##ei province of china has spread to many countries worldwide . efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections such as mer ##s and sar ##s in the past decades . however , to date , no licensed anti ##vira ##l treatment or vaccine exists for mer ##s and sar ##s . most of the efforts for developing co ##v vaccines and drugs target the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein or s protein , the major induce ##r of neutral ##izing antibodies . although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies , not many have progressed to random ##ized animal or human trials , hence may have limited use to counter co ##vid - 19 infection . this article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutic ##s to counter co ##vid - 19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier sar ##s - and mer ##s - co ##vs , which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection .  
introduction : the highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are lethal zoo ##not ##ic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years . these corona ##virus ##es are associated with novel respiratory syndrome ##s that spread from person - to - person via close contact , resulting in high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality caused by the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) . areas covered : the risks of re - emergence of sar ##s - co ##v from bat reservoir hosts , the persistence of mer ##s - co ##v circulation , and the potential for future emergence of novel corona ##virus ##es indicate anti ##vira ##l drug discovery will require activity against multiple corona ##virus ##es . in this review , approaches that ant ##ago ##ni ##ze viral non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins , neutral ##ize structural proteins , or mod ##ulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus disease are discussed . expert opinion : treatment of sar ##s and mer ##s in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutic ##s with general anti ##vira ##l activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular , rode ##nt , or non ##hum ##an primate models of highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus infection . based on lessons learned from sar ##s and mer ##s outbreak ##s , lack of drugs capable of pan - corona ##virus anti ##vira ##l activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus pan ##de ##mic .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 has since resulted in sporadic cases , intra - fa ##mi ##lia ##l transmission and major outbreak ##s in healthcare settings . the clinical picture of mer ##s - co ##v includes as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections , mild or moderately sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases and fatal disease . transmissions of mer ##s - co ##v within healthcare settings are facilitated by over ##crow ##ding , poor compliance with basic infection control measures , un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed infections , the super ##sp ##rea ##ders phenomenon and poor tri ##age systems . the actual contributing factors to the spread of mer ##s - co ##v are yet to be systematically studied , but data to date suggest viral , host and environmental factors play a major role . here , we sum ##mar ##ize the known factors for the diverse transmission of mer ##s - co ##v .  
until the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in early 2003 , corona ##virus infection was not considered to be serious enough to be controlled by either va ##cci ##nation or specific anti ##vira ##l therapy . it is now believed that the availability of anti ##vira ##l drugs effective against sar ##s - co ##v will be crucial for the control of future sar ##s outbreak ##s . recently , rna interference has been successfully used as a more specific and efficient method for gene si ##len ##cing . rna interference induced by small interfering rna can inhibit the expression of viral antigen ##s and so provides a new approach to the therapy of pathogen ##ic viruses . this review provides an overview of current information on corona ##virus and the application of small interfering rna in viral therapeutic ##s , with particular reference to sar ##s - co ##v .  
introduction : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an important emerging respiratory pathogen . mer ##s - co ##v resulted in multiple hospital outbreak ##s within and outside the arabian peninsula . the disease has a high case fatal ##ity rate , with the need for a therapeutic option . areas covered : in this review , we provide an overview of the progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for mer ##s . we searched pub ##med , em ##base , cochrane , sc ##opus , and google scholar , using the following terms : ‘ mer ##s ’ , ‘ mer ##s - co ##v ’ , ‘ middle east respiratory syndrome ’ in combination with ‘ treatment ’ or ‘ therapy ’ . expert commentary : there are multiple agents tried in vitro and in vivo . none of these agents were used in large clinical studies . available clinical studies are limited to the use of the combination of inter ##fer ##on and other agents . these clinical studies are based solely on case reports and case series . there are no prospective or random ##ized trials . there is a need to have prospective and random ##ized clinical trials for the therapy of mer ##s - co ##v . however , this strategy might be hampered by the sporadic cases outside the large hospital outbreak ##s .  
world health organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) a public health emergency of international concern . the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses . human infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestation ##s ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , mild , moderate to severe . the severe cases present with pneumonia , which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome . the outbreak provides an opportunity for real - time tracking of an animal corona ##virus that has just crossed species barrier to in ##fect humans . the outcome of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is largely determined by virus - host interaction . here , we review the discovery , zoo ##not ##ic origin , animal hosts , trans ##mis ##sibility and pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in relation to its inter ##play with host anti ##vira ##l defense . a comparison with sar ##s - co ##v , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , community - acquired human corona ##virus ##es and other pathogen ##ic viruses including human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency viruses is made . we sum ##mar ##ize current understanding of the induction of a pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ine storm by other highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es , their adaptation to humans and their us ##ur ##pati ##on of the cell death programmes . important questions concerning the interaction between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and host anti ##vira ##l defence , including as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and pre ##sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic virus shed ##ding , are also discussed .  
i have been researching corona ##virus ##es for more than forty years . this viewpoint sum ##mar ##izes some of the major findings in corona ##virus research made before the sar ##s epidemic and how they inform current research on the newly emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
there are a number of anti ##vira ##ls as well as anti ##vira ##l strategies that could be en ##vis ##aged to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ( or similar ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections . targets for the prop ##hyl ##actic or therapeutic interventions include interaction of the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ##1 domain ) with the host cell receptor , fusion of the s ##2 domain with the host cell membrane , processing of the replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s by the virus - encoded pro ##tea ##ses ( 3 ##c - like cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se [ 3 ##cl ##pro ] and papa ##in - like cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se ) and other virus - encoded enzymes such as the nt ##pas ##e / he ##lica ##se and rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase . human mono ##cl ##onal antibody blocking s ##1 may play an important role in the im ##mun ##op ##rop ##hyl ##ax ##is of sar ##s . fusion inhibitors reminiscent of en ##fu ##vir ##ti ##de in the case of hiv may also be developed for sar ##s - co ##v . various pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic and non ##pe ##pt ##idi ##c inhibitors of 3 ##cl ##pro have been described , the best ones inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v replication with a select ##ivity index greater than 1000 . human inter ##fer ##ons , in particular α - and β - inter ##fer ##on , as well as short interfering rna ##s could further be pursued for the control of sar ##s . various other compounds , often with an ill - defined mode of action but select ##ivity index ##es up to 100 , have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against sar ##s - co ##v : val ##ino ##my ##cin , g ##ly ##cope ##pt ##ide antibiotics , plant le ##ct ##ins , he ##sper ##eti ##n , g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin , au ##rin ##tric ##ar ##box ##yl ##ic acid , ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , nic ##los ##ami ##de , ne ##lf ##ina ##vir and cal ##pa ##in inhibitors .  
in this review , the current state of vaccine development against human severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus , focusing on recently published data is assessed . we discuss which strategies have been assessed im ##mun ##ological ##ly and which have been evaluated in sar ##s corona ##virus challenge models . we discuss inactivated vaccines , viral ##ly and bacterial ##ly vector ##ed vaccines , rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein and dna vaccines , as well as the use of at ##ten ##uated vaccines . data regarding the co ##rre ##lates of protection , animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of sar ##s disease are discussed . while there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against sar ##s are safe and im ##mun ##ogenic , va ##cci ##nated animals still display significant disease upon challenge . current data suggest that intra ##nas ##al va ##cci ##nation may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against sar ##s in humans .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) identified in 2003 has infected [UNK] people worldwide , killing nearly 10 % of them . the infection of target cells by the sar ##s co ##v is mediated through the interaction of the viral spike ( s ) protein ( 125 ##5 amino acids ) and its cellular receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the sar ##s co ##v receptor - binding domain ( amino acids n ##31 ##8 – t ##50 ##9 of s protein ) harbor ##s an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ace ##2 and is designated the receptor - binding motif ( rb ##m , amino acids s ##43 ##2 – t ##48 ##6 ) . in addition , the rb ##m is a major antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt , able to eli ##cit production of neutral ##izing antibodies . hence , the role of the rb ##m is a bi - functional bio ##active surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutral ##izing human anti - sar ##s mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) 80 ##r which targets the rb ##m and competes with the ace ##2 receptor for binding . here , we employ ph ##age - display peptide - libraries to rec ##ons ##ti ##tute a functional rb ##m . this is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate rb ##m peptide ##s that present a diversity of conform ##ations . screening such ‘ conform ##er libraries ’ with corresponding ligand ##s has produced short rb ##m construct ##s ( ca . 40 amino acids ) that can bind both the ace ##2 receptor and the neutral ##izing mab 80 ##r .  
background . there is still no effective method to prevent or treat severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , which is caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . in the present study , we evaluated the efficacy of a fully human mono ##cl ##onal antibody capable of neutral ##izing sar ##s - co ##v in vitro in a r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model of sar ##s . methods . the antibody 5 ##h ##10 was obtained by va ##cci ##nation of km mice bearing human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin genes with es ##cher ##ichi ##aco ##li – producing rec ##om ##bina ##nt peptide containing the dominant ep ##ito ##pe of the viral spike protein found in con ##vale ##scent serum samples from patients with sar ##s . results . 5 ##h ##10 , which recognized the same ep ##ito ##pe that is also a cleavage site critical for the entry of sar ##s - co ##v into host cells , inhibit ##ed propagation of the virus and path ##ological changes found in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues infected with the virus through the nasal route . in addition , we analyzed the mode of action of 5 ##h ##10 , and the results suggested that 5 ##h ##10 inhibit ##ed fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane . 5 ##h ##10 has potential for use in prevention and treatment of sar ##s if it re ##eme ##rge ##s . conclusions . this study represents a platform to produce fully human antibodies against emerging infectious diseases in a timely and safe manner .  
we present a retrospective analysis of the available articles on severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) published since the outbreak of the disease . sar ##s is a new infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus . originating in guangdong , southern china , at the end of 2002 , it has spread to regions all over the world , affecting more than 800 ##0 people . with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , sar ##s is an important respiratory disease which may be encountered world - wide . the ca ##usa ##tive virus was identified by a who - led network of laboratories , which identified the genome sequence and developed the first molecular ass ##ays for diagnosis . for the respiratory physician , detecting sar ##s in its earliest stages , identifying pathways of transmission , and implementing prevent ##ive and therapeutic strategies are all important . the who and the cdc have published helpful definitions of ‘ suspected ’ and ‘ probable ’ cases . however , the symptoms of the disease may change , and laboratory tests and definitions are still limited . even in a situation of no new cases of infection , sar ##s remains a major respiratory health hazard . as with influenza virus outbreak ##s , new epidemic ##s may arise at the end of each year .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection is associated with a high case - fatal ##ity rate , and the potential pan ##de ##mic spread of the virus is a public health concern . the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v ( mer ##s - s ) facilitates viral entry into host cells , which depends on activation of mer ##s - s by cellular pro ##tea ##ses . pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activation of mer ##s - s during viral up ##take into target cells has been demonstrated . however , it is unclear whether mer ##s - s is also cl ##ea ##ved during s protein synthesis in infected cells and whether cleavage is required for mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##ivity . here , we show that mer ##s - s is processed by prop ##rot ##ein convert ##ase ##s in mer ##s - s – trans ##fect ##ed and mer ##s - co ##v – infected cells and that several r ##xx ##r motifs located at the border between the surface and trans ##me ##mb ##rane subunit of mer ##s - s are required for efficient pro ##te ##ol ##ysis . however , blockade of prop ##rot ##ein convert ##ase ##s did not impact mer ##s - s – dependent trans ##duction of target cells expressing high amounts of the viral receptor , d ##pp ##4 , and did not mod ##ulate mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##ivity . these results show that mer ##s - s is a substrate for prop ##rot ##ein convert ##ase ##s and demonstrate that processing by these enzymes is di ##sp ##ens ##able for s protein activation . efforts to inhibit mer ##s - co ##v infection by targeting host cell pro ##tea ##ses should therefore focus on enzymes that process mer ##s - s during viral up ##take into target cells .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is associated with a mortality rate of > 35 % . we previously showed that mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) could in ##fect human macro ##pha ##ges and den ##dr ##itic cells and induce cy ##tok ##ine d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation . here , we further investigated the inter ##play between human primary t cells and mer ##s - co ##v in disease pathogen ##esis . importantly , our results suggested that mer ##s - co ##v efficiently infected t cells from the peripheral blood and from human l ##ym ##ph ##oid organs , including the sp ##leen and the tons ##il . we further demonstrated that mer ##s - co ##v infection induced ap ##op ##tosis in t cells , which involved the activation of both the ex ##tri ##ns ##ic and intrinsic ap ##op ##tosis pathways . remarkably , im ##mun ##osta ##ining of sp ##leen sections from mer ##s - co ##v – infected common mar ##mos ##ets demonstrated the presence of viral nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein in their cd ##3 ( + ) t cells . overall , our results suggested that the unusual capacity of mer ##s - co ##v to in ##fect t cells and induce ap ##op ##tosis might partly contribute to the high pathogen ##ici ##ty of the virus .  
in 2012 , a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) associated with severe respiratory disease , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ; previously known as human corona ##virus – erasmus medical center or hc ##ov - em ##c ) , emerged in the arabian peninsula . to date , 114 human cases of mer ##s - co ##v have been reported , with 54 fatalities . animal models for mer ##s - co ##v infection of humans are needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te mer ##s pathogen ##esis and to develop vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls . in this study , we developed r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues as a model for mer ##s - co ##v using intra ##tra ##che ##al in ##oc ##ulation . the infected monkeys showed clinical signs of disease , virus replication , his ##to ##logical lesions , and neutral ##izing antibody production , indicating that this monkey model is suitable for studies of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection caused severe pneumonia and multi ##org ##an dysfunction and had a higher crude fatal ##ity rate ( around 50 % vs 10 % ) than sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . to understand the pathogen ##esis , we studied viral replication , cy ##tok ##ine / che ##mo ##kin ##e response , and antigen presentation in mer ##s - co ##v – infected human mono ##cy ##te – derived macro ##pha ##ges ( md ##ms ) versus sar ##s - co ##v – infected md ##ms . only mer ##s - co ##v can replicate in md ##ms . both viruses were unable to significantly stimulate the expression of anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ines ( inter ##fer ##on α [ if ##n - α ] and if ##n - β ) but induced comparable levels of tumor nec ##rosis factor α and inter ##le ##uki ##n 6 . notably , mer ##s - co ##v induced significantly higher expression levels of inter ##le ##uki ##n 12 , if ##n - γ , and che ##mo ##kin ##es ( ip - 10 / c ##x ##cl - 10 , mc ##p - 1 / cc ##l - 2 , mi ##p - 1 ##α / cc ##l - 3 , ran ##tes / cc ##l - 5 , and inter ##le ##uki ##n 8 ) than sar ##s - co ##v . the expression of major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex class i and cost ##im ##ulator ##y molecules were significantly higher in mer ##s - co ##v – infected md ##ms than in sar ##s - co ##v – infected cells . mer ##s - co ##v replication was valid ##ated by im ##mun ##osta ##ining of infected md ##ms and ex vivo lung tissue . we con ##clusive ##ly showed that mer ##s - co ##v can establish a productive infection in human macro ##pha ##ges . the abe ##rran ##t induction of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es could be important in the disease pathogen ##esis .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel , potentially zoo ##not ##ic human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) . we investigated mer ##s - co ##v antibodies using a staged approach involving an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) , a differential rec ##om ##bina ##nt if ##a , and a plaque - reduction serum neutral ##ization ass ##ay . in 130 blood donors sampled during 2012 in jed ##dah and 226 slaughter ##house workers sampled in october 2012 in jed ##dah and ma ##kka ##h , saudi arabia , 8 reactive sera were seen in if ##a but were resolved to be specific for established hc ##ov ##s by disc ##rim ##ina ##tive testing . there is no evidence that mer ##s - co ##v circulated widely in the study region in fall 2012 , matching an apparent absence of exported disease during the 2012 ha ##j ##j .  
the transmission routes and risk factors for zoo ##not ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections are still unknown . we used the world health organization question ##naire for mer ##s - co ##v case - control studies to assess risk factors for human mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity at a farm complex in qatar . nine camel workers with mer ##s - co ##v antibodies and 43 workers without antibodies were included . some camel - related activities may pose a higher risk of mer ##s - co ##v infection , as may cross - border movements of camel ##s , poor hand hygiene , and overnight hospital stays with respiratory complaints . the risk factors identified in this study can be used to develop infection prevention and control measures for human mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
background . annually , saudi arabia is the host of the ha ##j ##j mass gathering . we aimed to determine the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) nasal carriage rate among pilgrims performing the 2013 ha ##j ##j and to describe the compliance with the saudi ministry of health vaccine recommendations . method . nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al samples were collected from 52 ##35 adult pilgrims from 22 countries and screened for mer ##s - co ##v using reverse transcript ##ase – polymer ##ase chain reaction . information regarding the participants ' age , gender , country of origin , medical conditions , and va ##cci ##nation history were obtained . results . the mean age of the screened population was 51 . 8 years ( range , 18 – 93 years ) with a male / female ratio of 1 . 17 : 1 . mer ##s - co ##v was not detected in any of the samples tested ( 321 ##0 pre - ha ##j ##j and 202 ##5 post - ha ##j ##j screening ) . according to the va ##cci ##nation documents , all participants had received men ##ing ##oco ##cca ##l va ##cci ##nation and the majority of those from at - risk countries were va ##cci ##nated against yellow fever and pol ##io . only 22 % of the pilgrims ( 17 . 5 % of those ≥ ##65 years and 36 . 3 % of dia ##bet ##ics ) had flu va ##cci ##nation , and 4 . 4 % had p ##ne ##um ##oco ##cca ##l va ##cci ##nation . conclusion . there was no evidence of mer ##s - co ##v nasal carriage among ha ##j ##j pilgrims . while rates of compulsory va ##cci ##nation ##s up ##take were high , up ##take of p ##ne ##um ##oco ##cca ##l and flu seasonal va ##cci ##nation ##s were low , including among the high - risk population .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in humans is highly lethal , with a fatal ##ity rate of 35 % . new prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are urgently needed . we isolated a fully human neutral ##izing antibody , mca ##1 , from a human survivor . the antibody recognizes the receptor - binding domain of mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and interfere ##s with the interaction between viral s and the human cellular receptor human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . to our knowledge , this study is the first to report a human neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody that completely inhibit ##s mer ##s - co ##v replication in common mar ##mos ##ets . mono ##therapy with mca ##1 represents a potential alternative treatment for human infections with mer ##s - co ##v worthy of evaluation in clinical settings .  
background . analysis of clinical samples from patients with new viral infections is critical to confirm the diagnosis , to specify the viral load , and to sequence data necessary for character ##izing the viral kinetic ##s , transmission , and evolution . we analyzed samples from 112 patients infected with the recently discovered middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . methods . respiratory tract samples from cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection confirmed by polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) were investigated to determine the mer ##s - co ##v load and fraction of the mer ##s - co ##v genome . these values were analyzed to determine associations with clinical sample type . results . samples from 112 individuals in which mer ##s - co ##v was detected by pc ##r were analyzed , of which 13 were sp ##ut ##um samples , 64 were nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens , 30 were tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates , and 3 were bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge specimens ; 2 samples were of unknown origin . tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates yielded significantly higher mer ##s - co ##v loads , compared with nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens ( p = . 00 ##5 ) and sp ##ut ##um specimens ( p = . 000 ##1 ) . tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates had viral loads similar to those in bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge samples ( p = . 307 ##9 ) . bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge samples and tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates had significantly higher genome fraction than nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens ( p = . 00 ##9 ##5 and p = . 000 ##2 , respectively ) and sp ##ut ##um samples ( p = . 000 ##9 and p = . 000 ##1 , respectively ) . the genome yield from tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rates and bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge samples were similar ( p = . 117 ##4 ) . conclusions . lower respiratory tract samples yield significantly higher mer ##s - co ##v loads and genome fraction ##s than upper respiratory tract samples .  
several lineage b beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) – like co ##vs ( sl - co ##vs ) were identified from rhino ##lo ##phus bats in china . these viruses are characterized by a set of unique accessory open reading frames ( or ##fs ) that are located between the m and n genes . among unique accessory or ##fs , or ##f ##8 is most hyper ##var ##iable . in this study , the or ##f ##8 ##s of all sl - co ##vs were classified into 3 types , and , for the first time , it was found that very few sl - co ##vs from rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus have or ##f ##8 ##s that are identical to that of human sar ##s - co ##v . this finding provides new genetic evidence for chinese horseshoe bats as the source of human sar ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe disease in human with an overall case - fatal ##ity rate of > 35 % . effective anti ##vira ##ls are crucial for improving the clinical outcome of mer ##s . although a number of rep ##ur ##posed drugs , con ##vale ##scent - phase plasma , anti ##vira ##l peptide ##s , and neutral ##izing antibodies exhibit anti - mer ##s - co ##v activity in vitro , most are not readily available or have not been evaluated in non ##hum ##an primate ##s . we assessed 3 rep ##ur ##posed drugs with potent in vitro anti - mer ##s - co ##v activity ( my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late mo ##fe ##ti ##l [ mm ##f ] , lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r , and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b ) in common mar ##mos ##ets with severe disease resembling mer ##s in humans . the lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r - treated and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b - treated animals had better outcome than the un ##tre ##ated animals , with improved clinical ( mean clinical scores ↓ ##50 . 9 % – 95 . 0 % and ↓ ##weight loss than the un ##tre ##ated animals ) , radio ##logical ( minimal pulmonary infiltrate ##s ) , and path ##ological ( mild bro ##nch ##oint ##ers ##ti ##tial pneumonia ) findings , and lower mean viral loads in nec ##rop ##sie ##d lung ( ↓ ##0 . 59 – 1 . 06 log ( 10 ) copies / g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##de 3 - phosphate de ##hy ##dro ##genase [ gap ##dh ] ; p < . 050 ) and extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry ( ↓ ##0 . 11 – 1 . 29 log ( 10 ) copies / gap ##dh ; p < . 050 in kidney ) tissues . in contrast , all mm ##f - treated animals developed severe and / or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads ( ↑ ##0 . 15 – 0 . 54 log ( 10 ) copies / gap ##dh ) than the un ##tre ##ated animals . the mortality rate at 36 hours post ##ino ##cula ##tion was 67 % ( un ##tre ##ated and mm ##f - treated ) versus 0 – 33 % ( lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r - treated and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b - treated ) . lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clinical trials . mm ##f alone may worse ##n mer ##s and should not be used .  
although bats are known to harbor middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) - related viruses , the role of bats in the evolutionary origin and pathway remains obscure . we identified a novel mer ##s - co ##v - related beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , hp - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##25 , from chinese pip ##ist ##rell ##e bats . although it is closely related to mer ##s - co ##v in most genome regions , its spike protein occupies a phylogenetic position between that of ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 and pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 . because ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 but not pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 can use the mer ##s - co ##v receptor human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) for cell entry , we tested the ability of hp - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##25 to bind and use hd ##pp ##4 . the hk ##u ##25 - receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) can bind to hd ##pp ##4 protein and hd ##pp ##4 - expressing cells , but it does so with lower efficiency than that of mer ##s - rb ##d . pseudo ##virus ass ##ays showed that hk ##u ##25 - spike can use hd ##pp ##4 for entry to hd ##pp ##4 - expressing cells , although with lower efficiency than that of mer ##s - spike and hk ##u ##4 - spike . our findings support a bat origin of mer ##s - co ##v and suggest that bat co ##v spike proteins may have evolved in a step ##wise manner for binding to hd ##pp ##4 .  
background : the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory infection with a high ( ~ 35 % ) mortality rate . neutral ##izing antibodies targeting the spike of mer ##s - co ##v have been shown to be a therapeutic option for treatment of lethal disease . methods : we describe the ge ##rm ##line diversity and neutral ##izing activity of 13 potent human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) that target the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein . biological functions were assessed by live mer ##s - co ##v , pseudo ##type particle and its variants , and structural basis was also determined by crystal ##log ##raphic analysis . results : of the 13 mab ##s displaying strong neutral ##izing activity against mer ##s - co ##v , two with the im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin heavy - chain variable region ( i ##gh ##v ) 1 - 69 - derived heavy chain ( named mer ##s - g ##d ##27 and mer ##s - g ##d ##33 ) showed the most potent neutral ##izing activity against pseudo ##type ##d and live mer ##s - co ##v in vitro . mu ##tage ##nes ##is analysis suggested that mer ##s - g ##d ##27 and mer ##s - g ##d ##33 recognized distinct regions in s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , and the combination of 2 mab ##s demonstrated a syn ##er ##gist ##ic effect in neutral ##ization against pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v . the structural basis of mer ##s - g ##d ##27 neutral ##ization and recognition revealed that its ep ##ito ##pe almost completely overlap ##ped with the receptor - binding site . conclusions : our data provide new insights into the specific antibody repertoire ##s and the molecular deter ##mina ##nts of neutral ##ization during natural mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans . this finding supports additional efforts to design and develop novel the ##ra ##pies to combat mer ##s - co ##v infections in humans .  
background : human infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) poses an ongoing threat to public health worldwide . the studies of mer ##s patients with severe disease and experimental ##ly infected animals showed that robust viral replication and intensive pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response in lung tissues contribute to high pathogen ##ici ##ty of mer ##s - co ##v . we sought to identify pattern recognition receptor ( pr ##r ) signaling pathway ( s ) that media ##tes the inflammatory cascade in human macro ##pha ##ges upon mer ##s - co ##v infection . methods : the potential signaling pathways were manipulated individually by ph ##arm ##aco ##logical inhibition , small interfering rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( sir ##na ) de ##ple ##tion , and antibody blocking . the mer ##s - co ##v - induced pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of key cy ##tok ##ines and / or che ##mo ##kin ##es . reverse transcription - quantitative polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay , flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry analysis , and western b ##lot ##ting were applied to evaluate the activation of related pr ##rs and engagement of adapt ##ors . results : mer ##s - co ##v replication significantly up ##re ##gul ##ated c - type le ##ct ##in receptor ( cl ##r ) macro ##pha ##ge - ind ##ucible ca ( 2 + ) - dependent le ##ct ##in receptor ( min ##cle ) . the role of min ##cle for mer ##s - co ##v - triggered cy ##tok ##ine / che ##mo ##kin ##e induction was established based on the results of antibody block ##age , sir ##na de ##ple ##tion of min ##cle and its adapt ##or sp ##leen ty ##ros ##ine kinase ( sy ##k ) , and sy ##k ph ##arm ##aco ##logical inhibition . the cy ##tok ##ine and / or che ##mo ##kin ##e induction was significantly at ##ten ##uated by sir ##na de ##ple ##tion of re ##tino ##ic acid - ind ##ucible - i - like receptors ( r ##lr ) or adapt ##or , indicating that r ##lr signaling also contributed to mer ##s - co ##v - induced pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response . conclusions : the cl ##r and r ##lr pathways are activated and contribute to the pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response in mer ##s - co ##v - infected macro ##pha ##ges .  
background : infection control measures have played a major role in limiting human / camel - to - human transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ; however , development of effective and safe human or camel vaccines is warrant ##ed . methods : we extended and opt ##imi ##zed our previous rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus 5 ( ra ##d ##5 ) – based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and cd ##40 - mediated specific responses to generate mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 subunit - based vaccine . we generated ra ##d ##5 construct ##s expressing cd ##40 - targeted s ##1 fusion protein ( ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 / f / cd ##40 ##l ) , un ##tar ##get ##ed s ##1 ( ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 ) , and green fluorescent protein ( ra ##d ##5 - g ##fp ) , and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 t ##g ( + ) ) mice . results : im ##mun ##ization of hd ##pp ##4 t ##g ( + ) mice with a single dose of ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 / f / cd ##40 ##l eli ##cite ##d as robust and significant specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g and neutral ##izing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 . after mer ##s - co ##v challenge , both vaccines conferred complete protection against mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , as evidenced by significantly und ##ete ##ctable / reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group . however , ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 – but not ra ##d ##5 - s ##1 / f / cd ##40 ##l – im ##mun ##ized mice exhibited marked pulmonary per ##iva ##scu ##lar hem ##or ##rh ##age post – mer ##s - co ##v challenge despite the observed protection . conclusions : incorporation of cd ##40 ##l into ra ##d ##5 - based mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 vaccine targeting molecule and molecular ad ##ju ##vant ##s not only enhance ##s im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and efficacy but also prevents ina ##d ##vert ##ent pulmonary pathology after viral challenge , thereby offering a promising strategy to enhance safety and pot ##ency of vaccines .  
background : the import ##ation of sar ##s was responsible for the outbreak ##s in singapore , hong kong , vietnam and canada at a time when this new disease had not been identified . we report the incidence and impact of cases of sar ##s imported to singapore between 25 february and 31 may 2003 , and describe national measures to prevent further import ##ation . methods : information on imported cases of sar ##s and measures taken at entry points to singapore was retrieved from the ministry of health and the civil aviation authority of singapore . results : of the 6 imported cases , which all occurred before screening measures were implemented at the airport , only the first resulted in extensive secondary transmission . of 44 ##2 , 97 ##3 air passengers screened after measures were implemented , 136 were sent to a designated hospital for further sar ##s screening ; none was diagnosed as having sar ##s . conclusions : the sar ##s outbreak in singapore can be traced to the first imported case . the absence of transmission from the other imported cases was probably a result of relatively prompt identification and isolation of cases , together with a low potential for transmission . new imported sar ##s cases therefore need not lead to major outbreak ##s if systems are in place to identify and isolate them early . screening at entry points is costly , has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself , but may be justified in light of the major economic , social and international impact which even a single imported sar ##s case may have .  
through a prospective co ##hort study the relationship between travellers ’ awareness of mer ##s - co ##v , and compliance with prevent ##ive measures and exposure to camel ##s was evaluated among australian ha ##j ##j pilgrims who attended ha ##j ##j in 2015 . only 28 % of australian ha ##j ##j pilgrims were aware of mer ##s - co ##v in saudi arabia . those who were aware of mer ##s - co ##v were more likely to receive recommended vaccines [ odds ratio ( or ) 3 . 1 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 1 . 5 – 5 . 9 , p < 0 . 01 ] , but there was no significant difference in avoiding camel ##s or their raw products during ha ##j ##j between those who were aware of mer ##s - co ##v and those who were not ( or 1 . 2 , 95 % ci : 0 . 3 – 5 . 2 , p = 0 . 7 ) . ha ##j ##j pilgrims ’ awareness is reflected in some of their practices but not in all .  
progress has been made in ks ##a in reducing the number and size of healthcare facilities outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v by the application of wide scope case definition leading to excessive mer ##s - co ##v testing . critical case definition review and application of point of care testing with revision of hc ##ws fur ##lou ##gh are urgently needed .  
we evaluated the micro ##bio ##logical diagnosis in 14 patients with ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical suspicion of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) attended in a non - endemic area between june 2015 and january 2017 . while no mer ##s - co ##v was detected , other respiratory viruses were identified in 12 cases and my ##co ##pl ##as ##ma pneumonia ##e in 1 case .  
background . the primary modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) appear to be direct mu ##cus membrane contact with infectious droplets and through exposure to form ##ites . knowledge of the survival characteristics of the virus is essential for formula ##ting appropriate infection - control measures . methods . survival of sar ##s - co ##v strain g ##vu ##6 ##10 ##9 was studied in stool and respiratory specimens . survival of the virus on different environmental surfaces , including a laboratory request form , an imp ##er ##vious di ##sp ##osa ##ble gown , and a cotton non ##dis ##po ##sable gown , was investigated . the vi ##ru ##ci ##dal effects of sodium h ##yp ##och ##lor ##ite , house deter ##gent , and a per ##ox ##y ##gen compound ( vi ##rk ##on s ; ant ##ec international ) on the virus were also studied . results . sar ##s - co ##v g ##vu ##6 ##10 ##9 can survive for 4 days in dia ##rr ##hea ##l stool samples with an al ##kali ##ne ph , and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for > 7 days at room temperature . even at a relatively high concentration ( 10 ( 4 ) tissue culture in ##fect ##ive doses / ml ) , the virus could not be recovered after drying of a paper request form , and its in ##fect ##ivity was shown to last longer on the di ##sp ##osa ##ble gown than on the cotton gown . all di ##sin ##fect ##ants tested were shown to be able to reduce the virus load by > 3 log within 5 min . conclusions . fe ##cal and respiratory samples can remain infectious for a long period of time at room temperature . the risk of infection via contact with drop ##let - contaminated paper is small . absorb ##ent material , such as cotton , is preferred to non ##ab ##sor ##ptive material for personal protective clothing for routine patient care where risk of large spill ##age is unlikely . the virus is easily inactivated by commonly used di ##sin ##fect ##ants .  
we report a ser ##ological ##ly confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in a 27 - year - old health care worker . the patient reported no respiratory complaints , and the findings of serial chest radio ##graphs were normal . this case illustrates the wide spectrum of clinical illness caused by infection with sar ##s corona ##virus .  
the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred in china in november 2002 . the agent causing this illness has been identified as a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - corona ##virus . since its introduction < 1 year ago , this virus has infected 80 ##9 ##8 people in 26 countries , killing 77 ##4 of them . we present an overview of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical presentation , diagnosis , and treatment of sar ##s based on the current state of knowledge derived from published studies and our own personal experience .  
the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in co ##hort ##s of health care workers ( hc ##ws ) with sub ##cl ##ini ##cal infection in sar ##s and non - sar ##s medical wards was 2 . 3 % ( 3 of 131 hc ##ws ) and 0 % ( 0 of 192 hc ##ws ) , respectively . rates for clinical sar ##s - co ##v infection among 74 ##2 hc ##ws on these wards were highest among nurses ( 11 . 6 % ) and health care assistants ( 11 . 8 % ) , indicating that these occupations are associated with the highest risks for exposure .  
background . a high initial or peak severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) — associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) load in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al specimens was shown to be associated with a high mortality rate . because all infected individuals were devoid of pre ##ee ##xi ##sti ##ng protective immunity against sar ##s - co ##v , the biological basis for the variable virus burden ##s in different patients remains elusive . methods . the nationwide sar ##s database in taiwan was analyzed , and gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of 281 single - nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) of 65 genes was performed for 94 patients with sar ##s , to identify s ##np ##s for which distribution between patients with or without detect ##able nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v was biased . results . ti ##ters of sar ##s - co ##v shed in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al specimens varied widely , ranging from non ##de ##tec ##table to 10 ( 8 ) sar ##s - co ##v rna copies / ml , and they were correlated positively with a high mortality rate ( p < . 000 ##1 , by trend test ) and with early death ( i . e . , death occurring within 2 weeks of the onset of illness ) ( p = . 001 ##5 , by trend test ) . virus shed ##ding was found to be higher among male patients ( p = . 001 ##4 , by multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression ) and among older patients ( p = . 01 ##5 , by multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression ) . detect ##able nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v was associated with poly ##morphic all ##eles of inter ##le ##uki ##ns 18 ( p = . 01 ##4 ) and 1a ( p = . 03 ##1 ) and a member of n ##f ##κ ##b complex ( re ##tic ##ulo ##end ##oth ##eli ##osis viral on ##co ##gen ##e homo ##log b [ re ##lb ] ) ( p = . 03 ##4 ) , all of which are pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory in nature , as well as the pro ##co ##ag ##ulation molecule fi ##bri ##no ##gen - like protein 2 ( p = . 00 ##8 ) . conclusion . the sar ##s - co ##v load is a deter ##mina ##nt of clinical outcomes of sar ##s , and it is associated with poly ##morphism ##s of genes involved in innate immunity , which might be regulated in an age - and sex - dependent manner . the findings of the present study provided leads to genes involved in the host response to sar ##s - co ##v infection ; if sub ##stan ##tia ##ted with functional studies , these findings may be applicable to other
background . previous studies have shown that common human corona ##virus might be ne ##uro ##tro ##pic , although it was first isolated as a pathogen of the respiratory tract . we noticed that a few patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) experienced central nervous symptoms during the course of illness . in the present study , we isolated a sar ##s corona ##virus strain from a brain tissue specimen obtained from a patient with sar ##s with significant central nervous symptoms . methods . using transmission electronic microscopy and nest ##ed reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction , the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen was identified in cultures of a brain tissue specimen obtained from the patient with sar ##s . his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic examination of the brain tissue was performed using the methods of im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry analysis and double im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing . fifteen cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es were detected in the blood of the patient with sar ##s by means of a bea ##d - based multi ##ass ##ay system . results . a fragment specific for sar ##s human corona ##virus was amplified from cultures of the brain suspension , and transmission electronic microscopy revealed the presence of an enveloped virus morphological ##ly compatible with a corona ##virus isolated in the cultures . path ##olo ##gic examination of the brain tissue revealed nec ##rosis of ne ##uron cells and broad hyper ##pl ##asia of g ##lio ##cytes . im ##mun ##osta ##ining demonstrated that mono ##kin ##e induced by inter ##fer ##on - γ ( mig ) was expressed in g ##lio ##cytes with the in ##filtration of cd ##6 ##8 ( + ) mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges and cd ##3 ( + ) t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes in the brain me ##sen ##chy ##me . cy ##tok ##ine / che ##mo ##kin ##e ass ##ay revealed that levels of inter ##fer ##on - γ – ind ##ucible protein 10 and mig in the blood were highly elevated , although the levels of other cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es were close to normal . conclusions . this study provides direct evidence that sar ##s human corona ##virus is capable of in ##fect ##ing the central nervous system , and that mig might be involved in the brain im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology of sar ##s .  
an as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred early in 2004 , during a community outbreak of sar ##s in guangzhou , china . this was the first time that a case of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s was noted in an individual with antigen ##emia and ser ##oco ##n ##version . the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case patient and the second index case patient with sar ##s in the 2003 – 2004 outbreak both worked in the same restaurant , where they served palm ci ##vet ##s , which were found to carry sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ##es . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information and laboratory findings suggested that the findings for the patient with as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection , together with the findings from previously reported ser ##ological analyses of handler ##s of wild animals and the 4 index case patients from the 2004 community outbreak , reflected a likely intermediate phase of animal - to - human transmission of infection , rather than a case of human - to - human transmission . this intermediate phase may be a critical stage for virus evolution and disease prevention .  
background . although middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is characterized by a risk of nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission , the detailed mode of transmission and period of virus shed ##ding from infected patients are poorly understood . the aims of this study were to investigate the potential role of environmental contamination by mer ##s - co ##v in healthcare settings and to define the period of viable virus shed ##ding from mer ##s patients . methods . we investigated environmental contamination from 4 patients in mer ##s - co ##v units of 2 hospitals . mer ##s - co ##v was detected by reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) and viable virus was isolated by cultures . results . many environmental surfaces of mer ##s patient rooms , including points frequently touched by patients or healthcare workers , were contaminated by mer ##s - co ##v . viral rna was detected up to five days from environmental surfaces following the last positive pc ##r from patients ’ respiratory specimens . mer ##s - co ##v rna was detected in samples from ant ##ero ##oms , medical devices , and air - vent ##ila ##ting equipment . in addition , mer ##s - co ##v was isolated from environmental objects such as bed sheets , bed ##rail ##s , iv fluid hang ##ers , and x - ray devices . during the late clinical phase of mer ##s , viable virus could be isolated in 3 of the 4 enrolled patients on day 18 to day 25 after sy ##mpt ##om onset . conclusions . most of touch ##able surfaces in mer ##s units were contaminated by patients and health care workers and the viable virus could shed through respiratory secret ##ion from clinical ##ly fully recovered patients . these results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices , and sufficient isolation period based on laboratory results rather than solely on clinical symptoms .  
new emerging pathogen ##s can quickly become a global health threat in this era . a number of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak ##s have been linked to healthcare facilities . the healthcare - associated transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been attributed to over ##crow ##ding , delayed diagnosis , and the breakdown of infection control systems . strict infection control precautions and a well - prepared hospital system may have contributed to no nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission occurring during the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infections imported to thailand . the recent outbreak ##s of mer ##s and previous emerging infections provide valuable lessons to be learned . continuous vi ##gil ##ance and strengthening of infection control systems will shape the capacity to prevent and control mer ##s - co ##v or new emerging disease transmission .  
background . the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outside the middle east occurred in south korea in 2015 and resulted in 186 laboratory - confirmed infections , including 36 ( 19 % ) deaths . some hospitals were considered epic ##enter ##s of infection and voluntarily shut down most of their operations after nearly half of all transmissions occurred in hospital settings . however , the ways that mer ##s - co ##v is transmitted in healthcare settings are not well defined . methods . we explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital air and surfaces to mer ##s transmission by collecting air and sw ##ab ##bing environmental surfaces in 2 hospitals treating mer ##s - co ##v patients . the samples were tested by viral culture with reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) using mer ##s - co ##v spike antibody , and electron microscopy ( em ) . results . the presence of mer ##s - co ##v was confirmed by rt - pc ##r of viral cultures of 4 of 7 air samples from 2 patients ' rooms , 1 patient ' s restroom , and 1 common corridor . in addition , mer ##s - co ##v was detected in 15 of 68 surface sw ##ab ##s by viral cultures . if ##a on the cultures of the air and sw ##ab samples revealed the presence of mer ##s - co ##v . em images also revealed intact particles of mer ##s - co ##v in viral cultures of the air and sw ##ab samples . conclusions . these data provide experimental evidence for extensive viable mer ##s - co ##v contamination of the air and surrounding materials in mer ##s outbreak units . thus , our findings call for ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigation of the possible scenarios for contact and airborne transmission , and raise concern regarding the ad ##e ##qua ##cy of current infection control procedures .  
during the mer ##s outbreak in korea , one case of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild mer ##s - co ##v infection was noted . eighty - two persons were exposed to the case without protection . they were isolated and rt - pc ##r and ser ##ology for mer ##s were performed . there was no transmission through an as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s case in this study .  
background : the widespread threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) to human health has made urgent the development of fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis and a safe and efficient anti ##vira ##l vaccine for prevent ##ive use . for this purpose , we investigated the antigen ##ici ##ty of different regions of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein . methods : the cd ##na for full - length n protein and its various regions from the sar ##s - co ##v was clone ##d and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . after purification , all of the protein fragments were printed on glass slides to fabric ##ate a protein micro ##ar ##ray and then probe ##d with the sera from sar ##s patients to determine the react ##ivity of these protein fragments . results : the full - length protein and two other fragments reacted with all 52 sera tested . four important regions with possible ep ##ito ##pes were identified and named as ep ##1 ( amino acids 51 – 71 ) , ep ##2 ( 134 – 208 ) , ep ##3 ( 249 – 273 ) , and ep ##4 ( 34 ##9 – 422 ) , respectively . ep ##2 and ep ##4 possessed linear ep ##ito ##pes , whereas ep ##1 and ep ##2 were able to form conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes that could react with most ( > 80 % ) of the tested sera . ep ##3 and ep ##4 also formed conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes , and antibodies against these ep ##ito ##pes existed in all 52 of the sera tested . conclusion : the n protein is a highly im ##mun ##ogenic protein of the sar ##s - co ##v . conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes are important for this protein , and antigen ##ici ##ty of the co ##oh terminus is higher than that of the nh ( 2 ) terminus . the n protein is a potential diagnostic antigen and vaccine candidate for sar ##s - co ##v .  
background : a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) was recently identified as the agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . we compared the abilities of conventional and real - time reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays to detect sar ##s co ##v in clinical specimens . methods : rna samples isolated from nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate ( np ##a ; n = 170 ) and stool ( n = 44 ) were reverse - transcribed and tested by our in - house conventional rt - pc ##r ass ##ay . we selected 98 np ##a and 37 stool samples collected at different times after the onset of disease and tested them in a real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r specific for the open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1b region of sar ##s co ##v . detection rates for the conventional and real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r ass ##ays were compared . to investigate the nature of viral rna molecules in these clinical samples , we determined copy numbers of or ##f 1b and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) gene sequences of sar ##s co ##v . results : the quantitative real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay was more sensitive than the conventional rt - pc ##r ass ##ay for detecting sar ##s co ##v in samples collected early in the course of the disease . real - time ass ##ays targeted at the or ##f 1b region and the n gene revealed that copy numbers of or ##f 1b and n gene sequences in clinical samples were similar . conclusions : np ##a and stool samples can be used for early diagnosis of sar ##s . the real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r ass ##ay for sar ##s co ##v is potentially useful for early detection of sar ##s co ##v . our results suggest that gen ##omic rna is the predominant viral rna species in clinical samples .  
background : the s ( spike ) protein of the et ##iol ##og ##ic corona ##virus ( co ##v ) agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) plays a central role in media ##ting viral infection via receptor binding and membrane fusion between the vi ##rion and the host cell . we focused on using synthetic peptide ##s for developing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v , which aimed to block viral invasion by eli ##cit ##ing an immune response specific to the native sar ##s - co ##v s protein . methods : six peptide sequences corresponding to the surface regions of sar ##s - co ##v s protein were designed and investigated by use of combined bio ##in ##form ##atics and structural analysis . these synthetic peptide ##s were used to im ##mun ##ize both rabbits and monkeys . anti ##ser ##a collected 1 week after the second im ##mun ##ization were analyzed by elisa and tested for antibody specific ##ity against sar ##s - co ##v by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent con ##fo ##cal microscopy . results : four of our six synthetic peptide ##s ( s ##2 , s ##3 , s ##5 , and s ##6 ) eli ##cite ##d sar ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies , of which s ##5 ( residues 78 ##8 – 820 ) and s ##6 ( residues 100 ##2 – 103 ##0 ) exhibited im ##mun ##ogenic responses similar to those found in a parallel investigation using truncated rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein analog ##s of the sar ##s - co ##v s protein . this suggested that our s ##5 and s ##6 peptide ##s may represent two minimum biological ##ly active sequences of the im ##mun ##ogenic regions of the sar ##s - co ##v s protein . conclusions : synthetic peptide ##s can eli ##cit specific antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v . the study provides insights for the future development of sar ##s vaccine via the synthetic - peptide - based approach .  
background : the availability of an early diagnostic tool for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) would have major public health implications . we investigated whether the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) can be detected in serum and plasma samples during the early stages of sar ##s and studied the potential pro ##gno ##stic implications of such an approach . methods : we developed two real - time quantitative reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays , one for the polymer ##ase and the other for the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id region of the virus genome , for measuring the concentration of sar ##s - co ##v rna in serum / plasma samples from sar ##s patients . plasma samples were obtained from 12 confirmed sar ##s patients on the day of hospital admission , as well as on days 7 and 14 after fever onset . serum samples were also obtained from 23 confirmed sar ##s patients on the day of hospital admission , 11 of whom subsequently required intensive care . viral rna was extracted from the plasma / serum samples . the extracted rna was subjected to analysis by the rt - pc ##r ass ##ays . results : the rt - pc ##r system for the polymer ##ase region detected sar ##s - co ##v rna in 50 % of plasma and 78 % of serum samples from sar ##s patients during the first week of illness . the detection rates for plasma dropped to 25 % at day 14 after fever onset . the median serum sar ##s - co ##v concentrations in patients who required and did not require intensive care unit admission during the course of hospital ##ization were 580 ##0 and 140 copies / ml , respectively ( mann – whitney test , p < 0 . 00 ##5 ) . these data were confirmed by the rt - pc ##r system for the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id region , which showed an even higher detection rate of 87 % . the correlation between the results obtained by the two rt - pc ##r systems was high ( pearson correlation analysis , r = 0 . 99 ##8 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . conclusion : plasma / serum sar ##s - co ##v quan ##ti ##fication represents a potentially useful early diagnostic and pro ##gno ##stic tool for sar ##s .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a new corona ##virus strain , sar ##s - co ##v . specific pro ##te ##omic patterns might be present in serum in response to the infection and could be useful for early detection of the disease . methods : using surface - enhanced laser des ##or ##ption / ion ##ization ( se ##ld ##i ) protein ##chi ##p technology , we profile ##d and compared serum proteins of 39 patients with early - stage sar ##s infection and 39 non - sar ##s patients who were suspected cases during the sar ##s outbreak period . pro ##te ##omic patterns associated with sar ##s were identified by bio ##in ##form ##atic and bio ##sta ##tist ##ical analyses . features of interest were then pu ##rified and identified by tandem mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry . results : twenty pro ##te ##omic features were significantly different between the 2 groups . fifteen were increased in the sar ##s group , and 5 were decreased . their concentrations were correlated with 2 or more clinical and / or bio ##chemical variables . two were correlated with the sar ##s - co ##v viral load . hierarchical cluster ##ing analysis showed that a majority of the sar ##s patients ( 95 % ) had similar serum pro ##te ##omic profiles and identified 2 subgroup ##s with poor pro ##gno ##sis . roc curve analysis identified individual features as potential bio ##mark ##ers for sar ##s diagnosis ( areas under roc curves , 0 . 73 ##3 – 0 . 99 ##5 ) . roc curve areas were largest for an n - terminal fragment of complement c ##3 ##c α chain ( m / z 28 119 ) and an internal fragment of fi ##bri ##no ##gen α - e chain ( m / z 590 ##8 ) . im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin κ light chain ( m / z 24 505 ) positively correlated with viral load . conclusions : specific pro ##te ##omic fingerprints in the sera of adult sar ##s patients could be used to identify sar ##s cases early during onset with high specific ##ity and sensitivity .  
background : the widespread threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) to human life has spawned challenges to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis and to create a safe anti ##vira ##l vaccine for prevent ##ive use . consequently , we thoroughly investigated the im ##mun ##ore ##act ##iv ##ities with patient sera of a series of synthesized peptide ##s from sar ##s - corona ##virus structural proteins . methods : we synthesized 41 peptide ##s ranging in size from 16 to 25 amino acid residues of relatively high hydro ##phi ##lic ##ity . the im ##mun ##ore ##act ##iv ##ities of the peptide ##s with sar ##s patient sera were determined by elisa . results : four ep ##ito ##pic sites , s ##59 ##9 , m1 ##37 , n ##66 , and n ##37 ##1 - 404 , located in the sar ##s - corona ##virus s , m , and n proteins , respectively , were detected by screening synthesized peptide ##s . notably , n ##37 ##1 and n ##38 ##5 , located at the co ##oh terminus of the n protein , inhibit ##ed binding of antibodies to sar ##s - corona ##virus l ##ys ##ate and bound to antibodies in > 94 % of samples from sar ##s study patients . n ##38 ##5 had the highest affinity for forming peptide - antibody complexes with sar ##s serum . conclusions : five peptide ##s from sar ##s structural proteins , especially two from the co ##oh terminus of the n protein , appear to be highly im ##mun ##ogenic and may be useful for ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays . the identification of these antigen ##ic peptide ##s contributes to the understanding of the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and persistence of sar ##s corona ##virus .  
background : the epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) posed a worldwide threat to public health and economic stability . although the pan ##de ##mic has been contained , concerns over its rec ##ur ##rence remain . it is essential to identify specific diagnostic agents and anti ##vira ##l vaccine candidates to fight this highly con ##tag ##ious disease . methods : we generated 14 mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) specific to the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein and used these to thoroughly map the n protein antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts . we identified the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant antigen ##ic sites responsible for the antibodies in sera from sar ##s patients and anti ##ser ##a from small animals and differentiated the linear from the conform ##ation ##al antibody - combining sites comprising the natural ep ##ito ##pes by use of yeast surface display . results : we identified 5 conform ##ation ##al and 3 linear ep ##ito ##pes within the entire n protein ; 3 conform ##ation ##al and 3 linear ep ##ito ##pes were im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant . the antibody responses to the n protein fragments in mammalian sera revealed that 3 regions of the n protein are strong antigen ##ic domains . we expanded the specific ##ity of the n protein ep ##ito ##pe and identified 4 novel conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes ( amino acids 1 – 69 , 68 – 213 , 212 – 341 , and 337 – 422 ) . conclusion : the antigen ##ic structures identified for the sar ##s - co ##v n protein , the ep ##ito ##pe - specific mab ##s , and the serum antibody profile in sar ##s patients have potential use in the clinical diagnosis and understanding of the protective immunity to sar ##s - co ##v .  
background : although there is evidence of person - to - person transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in household and healthcare settings , more data are needed to describe and better understand the risk factors and transmission routes in both settings , as well as the extent to which disease severity affects transmission . methods : a ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological investigation was conducted among mer ##s - co ##v case patients ( cases ) and their household contacts to investigate transmission risk in abu dhabi , united arab emirates . cases diagnosed between 1 january 2013 and 9 may 2014 and their household contacts were approached for enrollment . demographic , clinical , and exposure history data were collected . sera were screened by mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , with results confirmed by micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ay . results : thirty - one of 34 ( 91 % ) case patients were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mildly sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic and did not require oxygen during hospital ##ization . mer ##s - co ##v antibodies were detected in 13 of 24 ( 54 % ) case patients with available sera , including 1 severely sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , 9 mildly sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , and 3 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic case patients . no ser ##olo ##gic evidence of mer ##s - co ##v transmission was found among 105 household contacts with available sera . conclusions : transmission of mer ##s - co ##v was not documented in this investigation of mostly as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mildly sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases and their household contacts . these results have implications for clinical management of cases and formulation of isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission .  
background : definitive early - stage diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is important despite the number of laboratory tests that have been developed to complement clinical features and ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic data in case definition . path ##olo ##gic changes in response to viral infection might be reflected in pro ##te ##omic patterns in sera of sar ##s patients . methods : we developed a mass spec ##trom ##et ##ric decision tree classification algorithm using surface - enhanced laser des ##or ##ption / ion ##ization time - of - flight mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry . serum samples were grouped into acute sar ##s ( n = 74 ; < 7 days after onset of fever ) and non - sar ##s [ n = 106 ##7 ; fever and influenza a ( n = 203 ) , pneumonia ( n = 176 ) ; lung cancer ( n = 29 ) ; and healthy controls ( n = 65 ##9 ) ] co ##hort ##s . dil ##uted samples were applied to wc ##x - 2 protein ##chi ##p arrays ( cipher ##gen ) , and the bound proteins were assessed on a protein ##chi ##p reader ( model pbs ii ) . bio ##in ##form ##atic calculations were performed with bio ##mark ##er wizard software 3 . 1 . 1 ( cipher ##gen ) . results : the disc ##rim ##inatory class ##ifier with a panel of four bio ##mark ##ers determined in the training set could precisely detect 36 of 37 ( sensitivity , 97 . 3 % ) acute sar ##s and 98 ##7 of 99 ##3 ( specific ##ity , 99 . 4 % ) non - sar ##s samples . more importantly , this class ##ifier accurately distinguished acute sar ##s from fever and influenza with 100 % specific ##ity ( 187 of 187 ) . conclusions : this method is suitable for preliminary assessment of sar ##s and could potentially serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis .  
the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) since 2012 has been largely characterized by rec ##urrent zoo ##not ##ic spill ##over from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s followed by limited human - to - human transmission , predominantly in health - care settings . the full extent of infection of mer ##s - co ##v is not clear , nor is the extent and / or role of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections in transmission . we conducted a review of molecular and ser ##ological investigations through pub ##med and em ##base from september 2012 to november 15 , 2018 , to measure sub ##cl ##ini ##cal or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s - co ##v infection within and outside of health - care settings . we performed retrospective analysis of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infections reported to the world health organization to november 27 , 2018 , to sum ##mar ##ize what is known about as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections identified through national surveillance systems . we identified 23 studies reporting evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection outside of health - care settings , mainly of camel workers , with ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce ranges of 0 % – 67 % depending on the study location . we identified 20 studies in health - care settings of health - care worker ( hc ##w ) and family contacts , of which 11 documented molecular evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection among as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic contacts . since 2012 , 298 laboratory - confirmed cases were reported as as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to the world health organization , 164 of whom were hc ##ws . the potential to transmit mer ##s - co ##v to others has been demonstrated in viral - shed ##ding studies of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s infections . our results highlight the possibility for onward transmission of mer ##s - co ##v from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals . screening of hc ##w contacts of patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v is currently recommended , but systematic screening of non - hc ##w contacts outside of health - care facilities should be encouraged .  
the study investigated the general population ' s perceived in ##fect ##ivity of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) patients and factors associated with avoidance and disc ##rim ##inatory attitudes , including demographic background , sar ##s - related perceptions and emotional response to the sar ##s epidemic . a population - based survey was conducted in hong kong during 3 december 2003 through 4 january 2004 ; 475 hong kong chinese adults participated in the survey . perceptions of the in ##fect ##ivity and health conditions of recovered sar ##s patients and avoidance and discrimination towards them were measured . of the respondents , 75 . 7 % and 16 . 2 % , respectively , believed that sar ##s could be transmitted via as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s patients and those patients who have recovered from sar ##s for 18 months ; 72 . 7 % of the respondents believed that the health of sar ##s patients would severely and permanently be damaged ; 16 . 6 % showed some tendency of avoiding recovered sar ##s patients and 35 . 7 % expressed some sort of job - related disc ##rim ##inatory attitudes . perceived in ##fect ##ivity of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and recovered sar ##s patients , health sequel ##ae and emotional distress from sar ##s were independently associated with avoidance and disc ##rim ##inatory attitudes . the study showed that mis ##con ##ception ##s about the in ##fect ##ivity of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and recovered sar ##s patients were common . recovered sar ##s patients may also be facing avoidance and discrimination .  
the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was caused by a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . it spread rapidly to many countries and developing a sar ##s vaccine is now urgently required . in order to study the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of uv - inactivated pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion as a vaccine candidate , we sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly im ##mun ##ized mice with uv - inactivated sar ##s - co ##v with or without an ad ##ju ##vant . we chose aluminum hydro ##xide gel ( al ##um ) as an ad ##ju ##vant , because of its long safety history for human use . we observed that the uv - inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion eli ##cite ##d a high level of humor ##al immunity , resulting in the generation of long - term antibody secret ##ing and memory b cells . with the addition of al ##um to the vaccine formula , serum i ##gg production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper - im ##mun ##ized mice , though it was still insufficient to eli ##cit serum i ##ga antibodies . notably , the sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion itself was able to induce long - term antibody production even without an ad ##ju ##vant . anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies eli ##cite ##d in mice recognized both the spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins of the virus and were able to neutral ##ize the virus . furthermore , the uv - inactivated vi ##rion induced regional l ##ym ##ph node t - cell proliferation and significant levels of cy ##tok ##ine production ( il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , if ##n - γ and tn ##f - α ) upon rest ##im ##ulation with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion in vitro . thus , a whole killed vi ##rion could serve as a candidate antigen for a sar ##s vaccine to eli ##cit both humor ##al and cellular immunity .  
system dynamics approach offers great potential for addressing how intervention policies can affect the spread of emerging infectious diseases in complex and highly network ##ed systems . here , we develop a model that explains the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) epidemic that occurred in hong kong in 2003 . the dynamic model developed with system dynamics methodology included 23 variables ( five states , four flows , eight auxiliary variables , six parameters ) , five differential equations and 12 algebraic equations . the parameters were opt ##imi ##zed following an it ##erative process of simulation to fit the real data from the epidemic ##s . un ##ivar ##iate and multi ##var ##iate sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the reliability of the model . in addition , we discuss how further testing using this model can inform community interventions to reduce the risk in current and future outbreak ##s , such as the recently middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) epidemic .  
current treatment schemes for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) include broad - spectrum antibiotics , g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids , and rib ##avi ##rin . we evaluated the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of the sar ##s - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) to rib ##avi ##rin and inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - α in vitro by use of cy ##top ##athic effect , plaque ass ##ay , and im ##mun ##ob ##lot analysis . rib ##avi ##rin did not inhibit viral growth at concentrations attain ##able in human serum . in contrast , if ##n - α showed an in vitro inhibitor ##y effect starting at concentrations of 1000 i ##u / ml . in conclusion , rib ##avi ##rin alone is unlikely to be beneficial in the prop ##hyl ##ax ##is or treatment of sar ##s co ##v infections . clinical trials with if ##n - α might be justified to determine a beneficial effect on the outcome of sar ##s .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the major ca ##usa ##tive agent for the worldwide outbreak of sar ##s in 2003 . the mechanism by which sar ##s - co ##v causes at ##yp ##ical pneumonia remains unclear . the nuclear factor kappa b ( n ##f - κ ##b ) is a key transcription factor that activate ##s numerous genes involved in cellular immune response and inflammation . many studies have shown that n ##f - κ ##b plays an important role in the pathogen ##esis of lung diseases . in this study , we investigated the possible regulatory interaction between the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein and n ##f - κ ##b by lucifer ##ase activity ass ##ay . our results showed that the sar ##s - co ##v n protein can significantly activate n ##f - κ ##b only in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , which are susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection , but not in ve ##ro or he ##la cells . this suggests that n ##f - κ ##b activation is cell - specific . furthermore , n ##f - κ ##b activation in ve ##ro e ##6 cells expressing the n protein is dose - dependent . further experiments showed that there is more than one function domain in the n protein responsible for n ##f - κ ##b activation . our data indicated the possible role of the n protein in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
background ##im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py with mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) offers safe interventions for the prevention of infection in patients after organ transplant ##ation and for the treatment of cancers and auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases . mab 201 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) – specific mab that prevents establishment of viral replication in vitro and prevents viral replication in vivo when administered prop ##hyl ##actic ##ally . the efficacy of mab 201 in the treatment of sar ##s was evaluated in golden syrian ham ##sters , an animal model that supports sar ##s - co ##v replication to high levels and displays severe path ##ological changes associated with infection , including p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis and pulmonary consolidation methods ##gold ##en syrian ham ##sters that were intra ##nas ##ally in ##oc ##ulated with sar ##s - co ##v were treated with various doses of mab 201 or an irrelevant mab 24 h after in ##oc ##ulation . two to 7 days after infection , the ham ##sters were killed , and their lungs were collected for evaluation of viral ti ##ters and path ##ological findings results ##post ##ex ##po ##sure treatment with mab 201 can alleviate the viral burden and associated path ##ological findings in a golden syrian ham ##ster model of sar ##s - co ##v infection . after a ham ##ster is treated with mab 201 , its viral burden is reduced by 10 ( 2 . 4 ) – 10 ( 3 . 9 ) 50 % tissue - culture infectious doses per gram of tissue , and the severity of associated path ##ological findings , including inter ##sti ##tial p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis and consolidation , is also remarkably reduced conclusions ##the demonstration of successful post ##ex ##po ##sure mab 201 therapy in an animal model that demonstrates viral replication and associated pulmonary path ##ological findings suggests that mab 201 may be useful in the arsenal of tools to combat sar ##s 
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been a focus of international attention since its identification in 2012 . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly it is characterized by sporadic community cases , which are amplified by hospital - based outbreak ##s . healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have experienced imported cases , with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in korea . the mortality internationally is 36 % and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed . most facilities and healthcare providers outside of the middle east receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical management of mer ##s . when a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical app ##rai ##sal of the literature and put ##ative ph ##arm ##aco ##logical options . we identified published literature on the management of both mer ##s - co ##v and the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) through searches of pub ##med and who and the us cdc websites up to 30 april 2016 . a total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical app ##rai ##sal . most published literature on therapeutic ##s for mer ##s are in vitro experiments , animal studies and case reports . current treatment options for mer ##s can be categorized as : im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py with virus - specific antibodies in con ##vale ##scent plasma ; poly ##cl ##onal and mono ##cl ##onal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically modified animals ; and anti ##vira ##l agents . the use of any therapeutic ##s in mer ##s - co ##v remains investigation ##al . the therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warrant ##ing further investigation include con ##vale ##scent plasma , inter ##fer ##on - β / rib ##avi ##rin combination therapy and lo ##pina ##vir . co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , rib ##avi ##rin mono ##therapy and my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid likely have toxic ##ities that exceed potential benefits .  
when severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) first came to world attention in march 2003 , it was immediately perceived to be a global threat with a pan ##de ##mic potential . to help coordinate international research efforts , the national institute of all ##ergy and infectious diseases convened a col ##lo ##qui ##um entitled sar ##s : developing a research response on 30 may 2003 . breakout sessions intended to identify un ##met research needs in 5 areas of sar ##s research — clinical research , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , diagnostic ##s , therapeutic ##s , and vaccines — are summarized here . since this meeting , however , the identified research needs have been only partially met . needs that have yet to be realized include reliable methods for early identification of individuals with sar ##s , a full description of sar ##s pathogen ##esis and immune response , and animal models that faithful ##ly mimic sar ##s respiratory symptoms . it is also of the utmost importance that the global scientific community enhance mechanisms for international cooperation and planning for sar ##s research , as well as for other emerging infectious disease threats that are certain to arise in the future .  
cross - react ##ivity between antibodies to different human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) has not been systematically studied . by use of western b ##lot analysis , indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) , and enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , antigen ##ic cross - react ##ivity between severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) — associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and 2 hc ##ov ##s ( 229 ##e and o ##c ##43 ) was demonstrated in im ##mun ##ized animals and human serum . in 5 of 11 and 10 of 11 patients with sar ##s , paired serum samples showed a [UNK] - fold increase in antibody ti ##ters against hc ##ov - 229 ##e and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , respectively , by if ##a . overall , serum samples from con ##vale ##scent patients who had sar ##s had a 1 - way cross - react ##ivity with the 2 known hc ##ov ##s . antigen ##s of sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 were more cross - reactive than were those of sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - 229 ##e .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has emerged as a highly con ##tag ##ious , sometimes fatal disease . to find disease - specific b cell ep ##ito ##pes , ph ##age - displayed random peptide libraries were pan ##ned on serum im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) g antibodies from patients with sar ##s . forty - nine im ##mun ##op ##osi ##tive ph ##age clones that bound specifically to serum from patients with sar ##s were selected . these ph ##age ##borne peptide ##s had 4 consensus motifs , of which 2 corresponded to amino acid sequences reported for sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##sco ##v ) . synthetic peptide binding and competitive - inhibition ass ##ays further confirmed that patients with sar ##s generated antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v . im ##mun ##op ##osi ##tive ph ##age clones and ep ##ito ##pe - based peptide antigen ##s demonstrated clinical diagnostic potential by reacting with serum from patients with sar ##s . antibody - response kinetic ##s were evaluated in 4 patients with sar ##s , and production of i ##gm , i ##gg , and i ##ga were documented as part of the immune response . in conclusion , b cell ep ##ito ##pes of sar ##s corresponded to novel corona ##virus . our ep ##ito ##pe - based ser ##olo ##gic test may be useful in laboratory detection of the virus and in further study of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
stepping acquired im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency syndrome ( aids ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) as another type of disease has been threatening mankind since late last year . many scientists worldwide are making great efforts to study the et ##iology of this disease with different approaches . 13 species of sar ##s virus have been sequence ##d . however , most people still largely rely on the traditional methods with some disadvantage ##s . in this work , we used wolf ##ram approach to study the relationship among sar ##s viruses and between sar ##s viruses and other types of viruses , the effect of variations on the whole genome and the advantages in the analysis of sar ##s based on this novel approach . as a result , the similarities between sar ##s viruses and other corona ##virus ##es are not really higher than those between sar ##s viruses and non - corona ##virus ##es .  
the human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) o ##c ##43 and 229 ##e are common causes of upper respiratory tract infections . severe diseases were rare , however , until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v in 2003 . since then , other novel co ##v ( nl ##6 ##3 and hk ##u ##1 ) have been described , and they have caused respiratory infections worldwide . potentially exposed laboratory workers or animal handler ##s with rapidly progressive pneumonia not responding to standard anti ##ba ##cter ##ial coverage must be isolated with contact and drop ##let , and for specific situations , airborne precautions , till rapid tests of respiratory and fae ##cal samples are negative for sar ##s - co ##v . generally , the viral loads collected at different anatomical sites co ##rre ##late with the severity of symptoms and mortality . shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v peaks at day 10 after the onset of symptoms , which theoretically allows ample time for anti ##vira ##l treatment . the disease is characterized by un ##con ##tro ##lled replication of the virus and a prominent pro - inflammatory response . no random ##ized controlled trials with a specific anti - corona ##virus agent have been conducted with respect to therapy or prop ##hyl ##ax ##is . reports using historical matched controls have suggested that treatment with inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con - 1 ( a synthetic inter ##fer ##on ) combined with ste ##roid , pro ##tea ##se inhibitors together with rib ##avi ##rin , or con ##vale ##scent plasma containing neutral ##izing antibody , could be useful . prop ##hyl ##ax ##is with inter ##fer ##on or hyper ##im ##mun ##e g ##lo ##bu ##lin may be considered for un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure . the role of im ##mun ##omo ##du ##lat ##ors to decrease excessive inflammation remains elusive . other non - sar ##s - co ##v infections are generally mild ##er in im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##ete ##nt hosts , and scientific data on anti ##vira ##l treatment of these viruses are scarce .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus has been known to damage multiple organs ; however , little is known about its impact on the reproductive system . in the present study , we analyzed the path ##ological changes of test ##es from six patients who died of sar ##s . results suggested that sar ##s caused or ##chi ##tis . all sar ##s test ##es displayed widespread ge ##rm cell destruction , few or no sperm ##ato ##zoo ##n in the semi ##ni ##fer ##ous tub ##ule , thick ##ened basement membrane , and le ##uk ##oc ##yte in ##filtration . the numbers of cd ##3 + t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and cd ##6 ##8 + macro ##pha ##ges increased significantly in the inter ##sti ##tial tissue compared with the control group ( p < 0 . 05 ) . sar ##s viral gen ##omic sequences were not detected in the test ##es by in situ hybrid ##ization . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry demonstrated abundant i ##gg precipitation in the semi ##ni ##fer ##ous ep ##ith ##eli ##um of sar ##s test ##es , indicating possible immune response as the cause for the damage . our findings indicated that or ##chi ##tis is a com ##plication of sar ##s . it further suggests that the reproductive functions should be followed and evaluated in recovered male sar ##s patients .  
the spike ( s ) protein , a main surface antigen of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design . in the present study , three fragments of the truncated s protein were expressed in e . coli , and analyzed with poole ##d sera of con ##vale ##sc ##ence phase of sar ##s patients . the full length s gene dna vaccine was constructed and used to im ##mun ##ize bal ##b / c mice . the mouse serum i ##gg antibody against sar ##s - co ##v was measured by elisa with e . coli expressed truncated s protein or sar ##s - co ##v l ##ys ##ate as diagnostic antigen . the results showed that all the three fragments of s protein expressed by e . coli was able to react with sera of sar ##s patients and the s gene dna candidate vaccine could induce the production of specific i ##gg antibody against sar ##s - co ##v efficiently in mice with ser ##oco ##n ##version ratio of 75 % after 3 times of im ##mun ##ization . these findings lay some foundations for further understanding the im ##mun ##ology of sar ##s - co ##v and developing sar ##s vaccines .  
fi ##bri ##n deposition was universal in the lungs of sar ##s patients and f ##gl ##2 pro ##th ##rom ##bina ##se gene , a novel pro ##co ##ag ##ula ##nt , was demonstrated to express highly in a clinical ##ly relevant sar ##s model . to investigate whether and which structural protein of sar ##s - co ##v induced transcription of h ##f ##gl ##2 pro ##th ##rom ##bina ##se gene , three eu ##kar ##yo ##tic expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds expressing nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) , membrane protein ( m ) and spike protein 2 ( s ##2 ) of sar ##s - co ##v were co - trans ##fect ##ed with h ##f ##gl ##2 promoter lucifer ##ase - reporter pl ##as ##mi ##ds and β - gala ##ct ##osi ##das ##e pl ##as ##mi ##d in cho cells , respectively . m , n and s ##2 protein of sar ##s - co ##v were detected by western b ##lot ##ting and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry analysis . further ass ##ays demonstrated that expression of h ##f ##gl ##2 gene was related with n protein , but not with m or s ##2 protein in th ##p - 1 cells and ve ##ro cells . n protein significantly induced functional pro ##co ##ag ##ula ##nt activity in comparison with control group . lucifer ##ase ass ##ay showed that n protein of sar ##s - co ##v could activate the transcription of h ##f ##gl ##2 promoter compared with the pc ##dna ##3 . 1 empty vector . site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is and ems ##a ass ##ay further demonstrated that transcription factor c / e ##b ##p alpha band with its co ##gna ##te cis - element in h ##f ##gl ##2 promoter . the results showed that n protein of sar ##s - co ##v induced h ##f ##gl ##2 gene transcription dependent on the transcription factor c / e ##b ##p alpha , which maybe contribute to the development of th ##rom ##bos ##is in sar ##s .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) was introduced to the united states through air travel . although the risk of sar ##s ‐ co ##v transmission within aircraft cabins has been addressed by several studies , the magnitude of the risk remains unclear . methods : we attempted to contact all persons with working us telephone numbers aboard seven us ‐ bound flights carrying sar ##s patients . consent ##ing participants responded to a question ##naire , and a serum sample was collected at least 38 days after the flight and tested for sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ associated antibodies . participants reporting an illness compatible with sar ##s , with onset during the 2 ‐ to 10 ‐ day inc ##uba ##tion period , were considered suspect cases ; positive ser ##ology was required for confirmed cases . results : among 1 , 76 ##6 passengers and crew , 339 ( 19 % ) persons were contacted . of these , 312 ( 92 % ) completed question ##naire ##s , and blood was collected from 127 ( 37 % ) . ser ##ology was negative for all 127 participants , including three of four who met the clinical case criteria for sar ##s , and the fourth had a mild illness that lasted only 5 days . conclusions : transmission of sar ##s ‐ associated co ##v was not observed , suggesting that the risk of transmission is not amplified aboard aircraft .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is reported to have del ##eti ##ons of various sizes . recently , the large 38 ##6 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on ( l ##38 ##6 ##del ) comprising nu ##cle ##otide positions 277 ##19 - 281 ##0 ##4 and spanning open reading frames 9 – 11 has been reported in the genome ##s of some human isolate ##s from hong kong . in this study , archived specimens from 71 patients with sar ##s who were admitted to the new territory east cluster hospitals in hong kong were analyzed to determine whether the l ##38 ##6 ##del variant of sar ##s - co ##v was present . there was no clear relationship between the presence of the l ##38 ##6 ##del variant and sar ##s clinical severity as defined either by the need for intensive - care therapy and / or ventilation or by death . one patient had evidence of both the l ##38 ##6 ##del variant and the wild - type variant in the same clinical specimen , supporting the idea that sar ##s - co ##v exists as a quasi ##sp ##ec ##ies in some patients , although the clinical significance of these quasi ##sp ##ec ##ies remains unclear 
although primary gen ##omic analysis has revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) is a new type of corona ##virus , the different protein trees published in previous reports have provided no con ##clusive evidence indicating the phylogenetic position of sar ##s co ##v . to clarify the phylogenetic relationship between sar ##s co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es , we compiled a large data set composed of 7 con ##cate ##nated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses , using the maximum - likelihood , bay ##esian - inference , and maximum - par ##si ##mony methods . all resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between sar ##s co ##v and group 2 co ##vs is mono ##phy ##let ##ic . relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is characterized by pulmonary compromise ; however , patients often have evidence of other organ dysfunction that may reflect extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry dissemination of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we report on the distribution and viral load of sar ##s - co ##v in multiple organ samples from patients who died of sar ##s during the toronto outbreak . sar ##s - co ##v was detected in lung ( 100 % ) , bow ##el ( 73 % ) , liver ( 41 % ) , and kidney ( 38 % ) in 19 patients who died of sar ##s , with the highest viral loads observed in lung ( 1 . 0 × 10 ( 10 ) copies / g ) and bow ##el ( 2 . 7 × 10 ( 9 ) copies / g ) . fatal sar ##s was associated with multi ##org ##an viral dissemination in a distribution that has implications for disease manifestation , viral shed ##ding , and transmission .  
previous reports have indicated that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) – associated corona ##virus infection could develop at ##yp ##ical pneumonia with fu ##lm ##ina ##nt pulmonary ed ##ema . however , the target cells of sar ##s viral infection have not been characterized in detail . we report the path ##olo ##gic findings of the lung in 3 cases of sar ##s . chest radio ##graphs at 2 to 3 weeks of infection revealed an at ##yp ##ical pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation , a clinical characteristic of sar ##s infection . the presence of the sar ##s virus was determined by nest ##ed reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , and the infected cells were identified by in situ hybrid ##ization in open - lung bio ##psy and post ##mo ##rte ##m nec ##rop ##sy specimens . expression of sar ##s virus – encoded rna was detected in all 3 cases by rt - pc ##r , and the sar ##s viral signal was localized in p ##ne ##um ##ocytes by using in situ hybrid ##ization .  
objectives : evaluation of a wide variety of p ##yr ##idi ##ne n - oxide derivatives on their inhibitor ##y activity against fe ##line corona ##virus ( fi ##p ##v strain ) and human sar ##s - co ##v ( frankfurt strain - 1 ) in cell culture . methods : fi ##p ##v and sar ##s - co ##v were exposed to con ##fl ##uen ##t cr ##and ##el fe ##line kidney ( cr ##fk ) and simi ##an kidney ( ve ##ro ) cell cultures in the presence of serial concentrations of the test compounds . the anti - cy ##top ##athic activity of the p ##yr ##idi ##ne n - oxide derivatives was monitored by spec ##tro ##ph ##oto ##metric analysis . results and conclusions : a wide variety of p ##yr ##idi ##ne n - oxide derivatives have been found to be inhibitor ##y against fe ##line corona ##virus ( fi ##p ##v strain ) and human sar ##s - co ##v ( frankfurt strain - 1 ) in cr ##fk and simi ##an kidney ( ve ##ro ) cell cultures , respectively . the oxide part on the p ##yr ##idi ##ne moi ##ety proved ind ##is ##pen ##sable for anti - corona ##virus activity . the pot ##ency and virus specific ##ity of the p ##yr ##idi ##ne n - oxide derivatives varied depending the nature and specific location of sub ##sti ##tu ##ents ( i . e . al ##ky ##l , halo ##gen ##o , ni ##tro , etc . ) on the different parts of the molecule . the most selective compounds were active in the higher micro ##gram per litre range , being non - toxic at 50 – 100 mg / l . there was a poor structure - anti ##vira ##l activity relationship ( sar ) for the p ##yr ##idi ##ne n - oxide derivatives against fe - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v . one of the most active and selective compounds was shown to inhibit fe - co ##v replication at the transcription ##al level .  
to identify the function of ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 in invasion of host cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , we analyzed the protein - protein interaction among ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 , cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a ( cy ##pa ) , and sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins by co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation and surface pl ##as ##mon resonance analysis . although none of the sar ##s - co ##v proteins was found to be directly bound to ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v was bound to cy ##pa , which interact ##ed with ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 . further research showed that ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 , a trans ##me ##mb ##rane molecule , was highly expressed on 293 cells and that cy ##pa was integrated with sar ##s - co ##v . ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 – antagonist ##ic peptide ( ap ) – 9 , an ap of ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 , had a high rate of binding to 293 cells and an inhibitor ##y effect on sar ##s - co ##v . these results show that ha ##b ##18 ##g / cd ##14 ##7 , mediated by cy ##pa bound to sar ##s - co ##v n protein , plays a functional role in facilitating invasion of host cells by sar ##s - co ##v . our findings provide some evidence for the cy ##to ##logic mechanism of invasion by sar ##s - co ##v and provide a molecular basis for screening anti - sar ##s drugs 
the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) provided an opportunity to study the antibody response of infected individuals to the ca ##usa ##tive virus , sar ##s corona ##virus . we examined serum samples obtained from 46 patients with sar ##s , 40 patients with non - sar ##s pneumonia , and 38 healthy individuals , by use of western b ##lot ##ting ( wb ) , enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y ( elisa ) , and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay , using both native and bacterial ##ly produced antigen ##s of the virus . we found a highly restricted , im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g - dominated antibody response in patients with sar ##s , directed most frequently ( 89 % by elisa ) and predominantly at the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id . almost all of the subjects without sar ##s had no anti ##nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antibodies . the spike protein was the next most frequently targeted , but only 63 % of the patients ( by elisa ) responded . other targets of the response identified by use of wb included antigen ##s of 80 and 60 k ##da . several non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins clone ##d were not antigen ##ic , and the culture - derived nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id appeared to be specifically degraded .  
the non - structural proteins ( ns ##p or replica ##se proteins ) of corona ##virus ##es are relatively conserved and can be effective targets for drugs . few studies have been conducted into the function of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ns ##p ##5 . in this study , bio ##in ##form ##atics methods were employed to predict the secondary structure and construct 3 - d models of the sar ##s - co ##v g ##d strain ns ##p ##5 . sequencing and sequential comparison was performed to analyze the mutation trend of the polymer ##ase ns ##p ##5 gene during the epidemic process using a nu ##cle ##otide - nu ##cle ##otide basic local alignment search tool ( blast ##n ) and a protein - protein basic local alignment search tool ( blast ##p ) . the results indicated that the ns ##p ##5 gene was steady during the epidemic process and the protein was homo ##log ##ous with other corona ##virus ns ##p ##5 proteins . the protein encoded by the ns ##p ##5 gene was expressed in co ##s - 7 cells and analyzed by sodium dod ##ec ##yl ##sul ##fat ##e - poly ##ac ##ryl ##ami ##de gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is ( sd ##s - page ) . this study provided the foundation for further exploration of the protein ' s biological function , and contributed to the search for anti - sar ##s - co ##v drugs .  
background . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) remains a significant public health concern after the epidemic in 2003 . human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) that neutral ##ize sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##sco ##v ) could provide protection for exposed individuals . methods . trans ##genic mice with human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin genes were im ##mun ##ized with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt major surface ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ec ##to ##dom ##ain of sar ##s - co ##v . ep ##ito ##pes of 2 neutral ##izing mab ##s derived from these mice were mapped and evaluated in a mu ##rine model of sar ##s - co ##v infection . results . both mab ##s bound to s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein expressed on trans ##fect ##ed cells but differed in their ability to block binding of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to ve ##ro e ##6 cells . im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation analysis revealed 2 antibody - binding ep ##ito ##pes : one mab ( 201 ) bound within the receptor - binding domain at aa 490 – 510 , and the other mab ( 68 ) bound externally to the domain at aa 130 – 150 . mice that received 40 mg / kg of either mab prior to challenge with sar ##s - co ##v were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs , and doses as low as 1 . 6 mg / kg offered significant protection . conclusions . two neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes were defined for mab ##s to sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . antibodies to both ep ##ito ##pes protected mice against sar ##s - co ##v challenge . clinical trials are planned to test mab 201 , a fully human mab specific for the ep ##ito ##pe within the receptor - binding region .  
objectives : to describe the im ##mun ##ological responses and clinical outcome of corona ##virus ( sar ##s ) infected healthcare workers ( hc ##w ) who had been administered with con ##vale ##scent plasma as a treatment . methods : con ##vale ##scent plasma ( 500 ml ) was obtained from each of three sar ##s patients and trans ##fus ##ed into the three infected hc ##w . donors were blood type o and ser ##one ##gative for hepatitis b and c , hiv , sy ##phi ##lis and human t - cell l ##ym ##ph ##ot ##rop ##ic virus types i and ii ( h ##tl ##v - i and - ii ) . serum antibody ( i ##gg ) ti ##tre was > 640 . ap ##har ##esis was performed with a cs 3000 plus cell sep ##arat ##or followed by the forming of the con ##vale ##scent phase plasma . as part of the routine check with donated plasma , the con ##vale ##scent plasma was confirmed free of residual sar ##s - co ##v by rt – pc ##r . serial serum samples obtained from the recipients of the con ##vale ##scent plasma were collected to undertake real - time quantitative rt – pc ##r for sar ##s - co ##v for direct measurement of viral concentration . specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin i ##gm and i ##gg concentrations were ti ##tra ##ted using an antigen micro ##ar ##ray developed in - house . results : viral load dropped from 495 × 10 ( 3 ) , 76 × 10 ( 3 ) or 650 × 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml to zero or 1 copy / ml one day after trans ##fusion . anti - sar ##s - co ##v i ##gm and i ##gg also increased in a time - dependent manner following trans ##fusion . all three patients survived . one hc ##w became pregnant subsequently , delivering 13 months after discharge . positive anti - sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg was detected in the newborn . passive transfer of anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibody from the mother was considered as a possibility . conclusions : all infected hc ##w whose condition had progressed severely and who had failed to respond to the available treatment , survived after trans ##fusion with con ##vale ##scent plasma .  
motivation : the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has necessitated an in - depth molecular understanding of the virus to identify new drug targets . the availability of complete genome sequence of several strains of sar ##s virus provides the possibility of identification of protein - coding genes and defining their functions . computational approach to identify protein - coding genes and their put ##ative functions will help in designing experimental protocols . results : in this paper , a novel analysis of sar ##s genome using gene prediction method gene ##de ##ci ##pher developed in our laboratory has been presented . each of the 18 newly sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s has been analyzed using gene ##de ##ci ##pher . in addition to poly ##pro ##tein 1a ##b ( 1 ) , poly ##pro ##tein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike ( s ) , small envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , six to eight additional proteins have been predicted depending upon the strain analyzed . their lengths range between 61 and 274 amino acids . our method also suggests that poly ##pro ##tein 1a ##b , poly ##pro ##tein 1a , s , m and n are proteins of viral origin and others are of pro ##kar ##yo ##tic . put ##ative functions of all predicted protein - coding genes have been suggested using conserved peptide ##s present in their open reading frames . availability : detailed results of gene ##de ##ci ##pher analysis of all the 18 strains of sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s are available at http : / / www . i ##gi ##b . res . in / sar ##san ##aly ##sis . html 
background . development of vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is limited by the lack of well - characterized animal models . previous vaccine reports have noted robust neutral ##izing antibody and inflammatory responses in fe ##rret ##s , resulting in enhanced hepatitis . methods . we evaluated the humor ##al immune response and path ##ological end points in fe ##rret ##s challenged with the urban ##i strain of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) after having received formal ##in - inactivated whole - virus vaccine or mock vaccine . results . humor ##al responses were observed in fe ##rret ##s that received an inactivated virus vaccine . his ##top ##ath ##ological findings in lungs showed that infection of fe ##rret ##s produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and va ##cci ##nated fe ##rret ##s . sar ##s - co ##v infection demonstrated bro ##nch ##ial and bro ##nch ##iol ##ar hyper ##pl ##asia and per ##iva ##scu ##lar cuff ##ing in fe ##rret lung tissue , as seen previously in infected mice . no evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the fe ##rret ##s . all of the fe ##rret ##s cleared the virus by day 14 , 1 week earlier if va ##cci ##nated . conclusions . the vaccine provided mild immune protection to the fe ##rret ##s after challenge ; however , there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole - virus vaccine . the fe ##rret may provide another useful model for evaluating sar ##s vaccine safety and efficacy .  
background . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel infectious disease . no information is currently available on host - specific immunity against the sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , and detailed characteristics of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of sar ##s co ##v infection have not been identified . methods . elisa was used to detect antibody to sar ##s co ##v . reverse - transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction was used to detect sar ##s co ##v rna . t cells in peripheral blood of patients were quan ##ti ##fied by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry . results . of 36 patients with probable sar ##s co ##v infection , 30 ( 83 . 3 % ) were positive for i ##gg antibody to sar ##s co ##v ; in contrast , only 3 of 48 patients with suspected sar ##s co ##v infection , 0 of 112 patients with fever but without sar ##s , and 0 of 96 healthy control individuals were positive for it . i ##gg antibody to sar ##s co ##v was first detected between day 5 and day 47 after onset of illness ( mean ± sd , 18 . 7 ##± ##10 . 4 ) . conclusion . detection of antibody to sar ##s co ##v is useful in the diagnosis of sar ##s ; however , at the inc ##uba ##tion and initial phases of the illness , ser ##ological ass ##ay is of little value , because of late ser ##oco ##n ##version in most patients .  
the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a previously unidentified corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v is a major viral protein recognized by acute and early con ##vale ##scent sera from sar ##s patients . to facilitate the studies on the function and structure of the n protein , this report describe the expression and purification of rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v n protein using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus expression system . rec ##om ##bina ##nt he ##xa - his ##ti ##dine - tagged n protein with a molecular mass of 47 k ##d was produced in insect cells . rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein was pu ##rified to near homo ##gen ##eit ##y by ni ( 2 + ) - nt ##a affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy . in addition , we examined the sub ##cellular local ##ization of the n protein by con ##fo ##cal microscopy in tri ##cho ##pl ##usia ni bt ##1 tn 5 ##b ##1 – 4 cells infected with rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus . the n protein was found localized in the cy ##top ##las ##m as well as in the nu ##cle ##ol ##us . the pu ##rified rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein can be used in further functional study of sar ##s - co ##v .  
three single chain antibodies ( sc ##f ##v ) against the proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were isolated by ph ##age display from an sc ##f ##v antibody library . bio - pan ##ning was carried out against im ##mo ##bil ##ized pu ##rified envelope ( e ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . their binding activity and specific ##ity to e or n protein of sar ##s - co ##v were characterized by ph ##age - elisa . two of them , b1 ##0 and c2 ##0 , could recognize non - overlapping ep ##ito ##pes of the e protein according to the two - site binding test result . clone a1 ##7 could recognize n protein . the sequence of the ep ##ito ##pe or overlapping ep ##ito ##pe of sc ##f ##v antibody a1 ##7 was pt ##ds ##t ##d ##nn ##q ##ng ##gr ##nga ##rp ##k ##q ##rr ##p ##q . the affinity ( equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant , k ( d ) ) of sar ##s - co ##v e protein was 5 . 7 ##× ##10 ( − ##8 ) m for b1 ##0 and 8 . 9 ##× ##10 ( − ##8 ) m for c2 ##0 . the affinity of a1 ##7 for n protein was 2 . 1 ##× ##10 ( − ##6 ) m . all three sc ##f ##v antibodies were pu ##rified with affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy and determined by western b ##lot .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strain . analyses of t cell repertoire ##s in health care workers who survived sar ##s - co ##v infection during the 2003 outbreak revealed that their effect ##or memory v ##γ ##9 ##v ##δ ##2 t cell populations were selective ##ly expanded [UNK] months after the onset of disease . no such expansion of their α ##β t cell pools was detected . the expansion of the v ##γ ##9 ##v ##δ ##2 t cell population was associated with higher anti – sar ##s - co ##v im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ti ##ters . in addition , in vitro experiments demonstrated that stimulated v ##γ ##9 ##v ##δ ##2 t cells display an inter ##fer ##on - γ – dependent anti – sar ##s - co ##v activity and are able to directly kill sar ##s - co ##v – infected target cells . these findings are compatible with the possibility that v ##γ ##9 ##v ##δ ##2 t cells play a protective role during sar ##s 
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important issue for the treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome . recently , sar ##s - co ##v has been demonstrated to induce cell ap ##op ##tosis in ve ##ro - e ##6 cells . the possible role of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) in virus - induced ap ##op ##tosis is characterized in this study . growth arrest and ap ##op ##tosis via cas ##pas ##e - 3 and cas ##pas ##e - 9 activities were demonstrated in sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) - expressing human promo ##no ##cy ##te cells . the flu ##orescence intensity of di ##hy ##dro ##rh ##oda ##mine 123 stain ##ing indicated that cellular reactive oxygen species were markedly increased in sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) - expressing cells . moreover , in vivo signalling pathway ass ##ay indicated that 3 ##cl ( pro ) increased the activation of the nuclear factor - kappa b - dependent reporter , but inhibit ##ed act ##iva ##tor protein - 1 - dependent transcription . this finding is likely to be responsible for virus - induced ap ##op ##to ##tic signalling .  
a mysterious new respiratory illness known as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has become the most per ##plex ##ing infectious disease to emerge in the 21st century . from march to may 2003 , it competed daily with the war in iraq as the most sensation ##al media event of the moment . u . s . personnel serving in the republic of korea represented the largest u . s . military population at risk for sar ##s . with tensions growing between p ##yon ##gy ##ang and washington , the united states / republic of korea alliance could not afford to be rendered combat ineffective by sar ##s . to remain mission ready , the u . s . forces korea ( us ##fk ) commander declared a “ war on sar ##s ” and directed his medical staff to develop a plan to prevent a sar ##s outbreak among us ##fk personnel . this article outlines the us ##fk campaign plan for the sar ##s epidemic and documents lessons learned for future outbreak ##s of highly infectious diseases .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . infection of ve ##ro e ##6 cells with sar ##s - co ##v inhibit ##s cell proliferation . our previous study indicated that ak ##t , which is poorly ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in con ##fl ##uen ##t cultures of ve ##ro e ##6 cells , is ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated and then de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated upon infection by sar ##s - co ##v . in the present study , we showed that a ser ##ine residue of ak ##t was ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in ve ##ro e ##6 cells in sub ##con ##fl ##uen ##t culture and that ak ##t was de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated rapidly after sar ##s - co ##v infection without up - regulation of its ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation . ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of g ##ly ##co ##gen synth ##ase kinase - 3 ##β , which is one of the downstream targets of ak ##t , was prevented in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . however , treatment with g ##ly ##co ##gen synth ##ase kinase - 3 ##β small interfering rna indicated that the g ##ly ##co ##gen synth ##ase kinase - 3 ##β signaling pathway was not related to inhibition of cell proliferation . treatment of ve ##ro e ##6 cells with the ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol 3 ′ - kinase / ak ##t inhibitor , l ##y ##29 ##400 ##2 , which induce ##s de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of ak ##t , inhibit ##ed cell proliferation . as shown in our previous studies , ap ##op ##tosis occurred in virus - infected cells within 18 h post ##in ##fect ##ion . cellular mrna transcription , which was reported to be up - regulated in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ca ##co - 2 cells , was not up - regulated in virus - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells , partially as a result of ap ##op ##tosis . these results suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation is regulated by both the ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol 3 ′ - kinase / ak ##t signaling pathway and by ap ##op ##tosis in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . this is the first study to analyze sar ##s - co ##v - induced cell growth inhibition .  
since the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , singapore has enhanced its national surveillance system to detect the potential import ##ation of this novel pathogen . using the guidelines from the singapore ministry of health , a suspect case was defined as a person with clinical signs and symptoms suggest ##ive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathless ##ness , and with an ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link to countries where mer ##s - co ##v cases had been reported within the preceding 14 days . this report describes a retrospective review of 85 ##1 suspected mer ##s - co ##v cases assessed at the adult tertiary - care hospital in singapore between september 2012 and december 2015 . in total , 262 patients ( 31 % ) were hospitalized . all had mer ##s - co ##v infection ruled out by rt – pc ##r or clinical assessment . two hundred and thirty ( 88 % ) of the hospitalized patients were also investigated for influenza virus by rt – pc ##r . of these , 62 ( 27 % ) tested positive for seasonal influenza . none of the patients with positive influenza results had been va ##cci ##nated in the year prior to hospital admission . ninety - three ( 36 % ) out of the 262 hospitalized patients had clinical and / or radio ##logical evidence of pneumonia . this study demonstrates the potential benefits of pre - travel va ##cci ##nation against influenza and p ##ne ##um ##oco ##cca ##l disease .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus discovered in 2012 . since then , 1806 cases , including 56 ##4 deaths , have been reported by the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) and affected countries as of 1 june 2016 . previous literature attributed increases in mer ##s - co ##v transmission to camel breeding season as camel ##s are likely the reservoir for the virus . however , this literature review and subsequent analysis indicate a lack of seasonal ##ity . a retrospective , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological cluster analysis was conducted to investigate increases in mer ##s - co ##v transmission and reports of household and nos ##oco ##mia ##l clusters . cases were verified and associations between cases were sub ##stan ##tia ##ted through an extensive literature review and the armed forces health surveillance branch ' s tier ##ed source classification system . a total of 51 clusters were identified , primarily nos ##oco ##mia ##l ( 80 · 4 % ) and most occurred in ks ##a ( 45 · 1 % ) . clusters corresponded temporal ##ly with the majority of periods of greatest incidence , suggesting a strong correlation between nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission and notable increases in cases .  
this study set out to identify and anal ##yse trends and seasonal variations of monthly global reported cases of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . it also made a prediction based on the reported and extra ##pol ##ated into the future by forecast ##ing the trend . finally , the study assessed contributions of various risk factors in the reported cases . the motivation for this study is that mer ##s - co ##v remains among the list of blue ##print priority and potential pan ##de ##mic diseases globally . yet , there is a pau ##city of empirical literature examining trends and seasonal ##ity as the available evidence is generally descriptive and an ##ec ##dot ##al . the study is a time series analysis using monthly global reported cases of mer ##s - co ##v by the world health organisation between january 2015 and january 2018 . we deco ##mp ##osed the series into seasonal , irregular and trend components and identified patterns , smooth ##ened series , generated predictions and employed forecast ##ing techniques based on linear regression . we assessed contributions of various risk factors in mer ##s - co ##v cases over time . successive months of the mer ##s - co ##v cases suggest a significant decreasing trend ( p = 0 . 02 ##6 for monthly series and p = 0 . 04 ##7 for quarterly series ) . the mer ##s - co ##v cases are forecast to wan ##e by end 2018 . seasonal ##ity component of the cases os ##ci ##lla ##ted below or above the baseline ( the centred moving average ) , but no association with the series over time was noted . the results revealed contributions of risk factors such as camel contact , male , old age and being from saudi arabia and middle east regions to the overall reported cases of mer ##s - co ##v . the trend component and several risk factors for global mer ##s - co ##v cases , including camel contact , male , age and geography / region significantly affected the series . our statistical models appear to suggest significant predict ##ive capacity and the findings may well inform healthcare practitioners and policy ##makers about the underlying dynamics that produced the globally reported mer ##s - co ##v cases .  
background : since the first isolation of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia in 2012 , sporadic cases , clusters , and sometimes large outbreak ##s have been reported . objective : to describe the recent ( 2015 ) mer ##s - co ##v outbreak at a large tertiary care hospital in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia . methods : we conducted an ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic outbreak investigation , including case finding and contact tracing and screening . mer ##s - co ##v cases were categorized as suspected , probable , and confirmed . a confirmed case was defined as positive reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction test for mer ##s - co ##v . results : of the 130 suspected cases , 81 ( 62 % ) were confirmed and 49 ( 38 % ) were probable . these included 87 patients ( 67 % ) and 43 healthcare workers ( 33 % ) . older age ( mean [ sd ] , 64 . 4 [ 18 . 3 ] vs 40 . 1 [ 11 . 3 ] years , p < . 001 ) , symptoms ( 97 % vs 58 % , p < . 001 ) , and como ##rb ##idi ##ty ( 99 % vs 42 % , p < . 001 ) were more common in patients than healthcare workers . almost all patients ( 97 % ) were hospitalized whereas most healthcare workers ( 72 % ) were home isolated . among 96 hospitalized cases , 63 ( 66 % ) required intensive care unit management and 60 ( 63 % ) required mechanical ventilation . among all 130 cases , 51 ( 39 % ) died ; all were patients ( 51 [ 59 % ] ) with no deaths among healthcare workers . more than half ( 54 % ) of infections were believed to be caught at the emergency department . strict infection control measures , including isolation and closure of the emergency department , were implemented to interrupt the chain of transmission and end the outbreak . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v remains a major healthcare threat . early recognition of cases and rapid implementation of infection control measures are necessary . in ##fect control ho ##sp ep ##ide ##mi ##ol 2016 ; 1 – 9 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) envelope spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is responsible for the fusion between the membranes of the virus and the target cell . in the case of the s ##2 domain of protein s , it has been found a highly hydro ##phobic and inter ##fa ##cial domain flanked by the he ##pta ##d repeat 1 and 2 regions ; significantly , different peptide ##s pertaining to this domain have shown a significant leak ##age effect and an important plaque formation inhibition , which , similarly to hiv - 1 gp ##41 , support the role of this region in the fusion process . therefore , we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 107 ##3 – 109 ##5 of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , peptide sar ##s ( l ) in the presence of different membrane model systems , as well as the structural changes taking place in both the lip ##id and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane . our results show that sar ##s ( l ) strongly partition ##s into ph ##os ##ph ##oli ##pid membranes and organizes differently in lip ##id environments , displaying membrane activity mod ##ulated by the lip ##id composition of the membrane . these data would support its role in sar ##s - co ##v mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the region where this peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes .  
the recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in wu ##han , china has posed a serious threat to global public health . to develop specific anti - corona ##virus therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s , the molecular mechanism that under ##lies viral infection must first be defined . therefore , we here ##in established a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike ( s ) protein - mediated cell – cell fusion ass ##ay and found that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of sar ##s - co ##v . we solved the x - ray crystal structure of six - he ##lica ##l bundle ( 6 - h ##b ) core of the hr ##1 and hr ##2 domains in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein s ##2 subunit , revealing that several mu ##tated amino acid residues in the hr ##1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the hr ##2 domain . we previously developed a pan - corona ##virus fusion inhibitor , ek ##1 , which targeted the hr ##1 domain and could inhibit infection by diver ##gent human corona ##virus ##es tested , including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . here we generated a series of lip ##ope ##pt ##ides derived from ek ##1 and found that ek ##1 ##c ##4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein - mediated membrane fusion and pseudo ##virus infection with ic ##50 ##s of 1 . 3 and 15 . 8 nm , about 241 - and 149 - fold more potent than the original ek ##1 peptide , respectively . ek ##1 ##c ##4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human corona ##virus pseudo ##virus ##es tested , including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , as well as sar ##sr - co ##vs , and potent ##ly inhibit ##ed the replication of 5 live human corona ##virus ##es examined , including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . intra ##nas ##al application of ek ##1 ##c ##4 before or after challenge with hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 protected mice from infection , suggesting that ek ##1 ##c ##4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other emerging sar ##sr - co ##vs .  
two new zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es causing disease in humans ( zu ##ml ##a et al . 2015 ##a ; hui and zu ##ml ##a 2015 ; pei ##ris et al . 2003 ; yu et al . 2014 ) have been the focus of international attention for the past 14 years due to their epidemic potential ; ( 1 ) the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ( pei ##ris et al . 2003 ) first discovered in china in 2001 caused a major global epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . ( 2 ) the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a new corona virus isolated for the first time in a patients who died of severe lower respiratory tract infection in jed ##dah ( saudi arabia ) in june 2012 ( za ##ki et al . 2012 ) . the disease has been named middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) and it has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of rec ##urrent nos ##oco ##mia ##l and community outbreak ##s , and its association with severe disease and high mortality rates ( ass ##iri et al . 2013 ##a ; al - abd ##alla ##t et al . 2014 ; me ##mis ##h et al . 2013 ##a ; ob ##oh ##o et al . 2015 ; the who mer ##s - co ##v research group 2013 ; cot ##ten et al . 2013 ##a ; ass ##iri et al . 2013 ##b ; me ##mis ##h et al . 2013 ##b ; az ##har et al . 2014 ; kim et al . 2015 ; wang et al . 2015 ; hui et al . 2015 ##a ) . cases of mer ##s have been reported from all continents and have been linked with travel to the middle east ( hui et al . 2015 ##a ; who 2015 ##c ) . the world health organization ( who ) have held nine meetings of the emergency committee ( ec ) convened by the director - general under the international health regulations ( i ##hr 2005 ) regarding mer ##s - co ##v ( who 2015 ##c ) . there is wish ##ful anticipation in the political and scientific communities that mer ##s - co ##v like sar ##s - co ##v will disappear with time . however it ’ s been nearly 4 years since the first discovery of mer ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s cases continue to be reported throughout the year from the middle east ( who 2015 ##c ) . there is a large mer ##s - co ##v camel reservoir , and there is no specific treatment or vaccine ( zu ##ml ##a et al . 2015 ##a ) . with 10 million people visiting saudi arabia every year for um ##rah and / or ha ##j ##j , the potential risk
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was the first pan ##de ##mic trans ##missible disease of previously unknown ae ##ti ##ology in the twenty - first century . early ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigations suggested an animal origin for sar ##s - co ##v . vi ##rol ##ogical and ser ##ological studies indicated that masked palm ci ##vet ##s ( pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta ) , together with two other wildlife animals , sampled from a live animal market were infected with sar ##s - co ##v or a closely related virus . recently , horseshoe bats in the genus rhino ##lo ##phus have been identified as natural reservoir of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es . here , we review studies by different groups demonstrating that sar ##s - co ##v succeeded in spill ##over from a wildlife reservoir ( probably bats ) to human population via an intermediate host ( s ) and that rapid virus evolution played a key role in the adaptation of sar ##s - co ##vs in at least two non ##res ##er ##vo ##ir species within a short period .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome is a novel human disease caused by a corona ##virus of animal origin . soon after the discovery sar ##s - co ##v , several molecular ass ##ays were described for the detection of this virus . of these , conventional and quantitative rt - pc ##r approaches were the primary tools for sar ##s - co ##v rna detection . in this chapter we describe a two - step conventional rt - pc ##r and a one - step quantitative rt - pc ##r that were used routinely in our laboratories during the sar ##s outbreak .  
im ##mun ##ological detection of viruses and their components by mono ##cl ##onal antibodies is a powerful method for studying the structure and function of viral molecules . here we describe detailed methods for establishing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . b cell hybrid ##oma ##s are generated from mice that are hyper ##im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s . the hybrid ##oma ##s produce mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that recognize viral component molecules , including the spike protein ( s ) and the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) , enabling the im ##mun ##ological detection of sar ##s - co ##v by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing , im ##mun ##ob ##lot , or an antigen - capture elisa system . in addition , several s protein - specific antibodies are shown to have in vitro neutral ##ization activity . thus the mono ##cl ##onal antibody approach provides useful tools for rapid and specific diagnosis of sar ##s , as well as for possible antibody - based treatment of the disease .  
the ba ##c - to - ba ##c ba ##cu ##lov ##irus expression system was used to generate a rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus capable of expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) 3a protein . using the same expression system , two structural proteins , membrane ( m ) and envelope ( e ) , were co - expressed to form sar ##s - co ##v virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) within an insect cell . expression of viral proteins was confirmed by western b ##lot analysis and the formation of v ##lp ##s was studied by transmission electron microscopy .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) contains a spike ( s ) protein that binds to a receptor molecule ( ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ; ace ##2 ) , induce ##s membrane fusion , and serves as a neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pe . to study the functions of the s protein , we describe here the generation of sar ##s - co ##v s protein - bearing ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) pseudo ##type using a vs ##v ##∆ ##g ##∗ / g ##fp system in which the g gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein ( g ##fp ) gene ( vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - st ##19 / g ##fp ) . partial del ##eti ##on of the cy ##top ##las ##mic domain of sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( sar ##s - co ##v - st ##19 ) allowed efficient incorporation into the vs ##v particle that enabled the generation of a high ti ##ter of pseudo ##type virus . neutral ##ization ass ##ay with anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibody revealed that vs ##v - sar ##s - st ##19 / g ##fp pseudo ##type infection is mediated by sar ##s - co ##v s protein . the vs ##v ##∆ ##g ##∗ / sea ##p system , which secret ##es al ##kali ##ne ph ##os ##pha ##tase instead of g ##fp , was also generated as a vs ##v pseudo ##type having sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - st ##19 / sea ##p ) . this system enabled high - through ##put analysis of sar ##s - co ##v s protein - mediated cell entry by measuring al ##kali ##ne ph ##os ##pha ##tase activity . thus , vs ##v pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v s protein is useful for developing a rapid detection system for neutral ##izing antibody specific for sar ##s - co ##v infection as well as studying the s - mediated cell entry of sar ##s - co ##v .  
the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a new type of corona ##virus , known as sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . although the sar ##s epidemic has subsided , many authorities , including the world health organization ( who ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , have warned of the possible re - emergence of this highly infectious disease . although antibody - based diagnosis of sar ##s has been demonstrated to be a reliable proof of sar ##s infection , it is not sensitive enough for detection during the early phase of the disease . to date , based on the publicly released full gen ##omic sequences of sar ##s - co ##v , various molecular detection methods based on reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) have been developed . although most of the ass ##ays have initially been focused on rna extracted from nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates , urine , and stool ##s , several of the more recently developed ass ##ays have been based on the analysis of rna extracted from plasma and serum . such ass ##ays allow the more standardized quantitative expression of viral loads and are potentially useful for early sar ##s diagnosis . in this chapter , two real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r systems for the quan ##ti ##fication of sar ##s - co ##v rna in serum are discussed . the two rt - pc ##r systems , one aimed toward the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id region and the other toward the polymer ##ase region of the virus genome , have a detection rate of up to 80 % during the first week of illness . these quantitative systems are potentially useful for the early diagnosis of sar ##s and can also provide viral load information that might assist clinic ##ians in making a pro ##gno ##stic evaluation of an infected individual .  
the construction of corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infectious clones had been hampered by the large size of the viral genome ( around 30 kb ) and the instability of pl ##as ##mi ##ds carrying co ##v replica ##se sequences in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . several approaches have been developed to overcome these problems . here we describe the engineering of co ##v full - length cd ##na clones using bacterial artificial chromosomes ( ba ##cs ) . in this system the viral rna is expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cy ##tom ##ega ##lov ##irus promoter and further amplified in the cy ##top ##las ##m by the viral replica ##se . the ba ##c - based strategy is an efficient system that allows easy manipulation of co ##v genome ##s to study fundamental viral processes and also to develop genetically defined vaccines . the procedure is illustrated by the cl ##oning of the genome of sar ##s corona ##virus , urban ##i strain .  
the aim of this study was to use ie ##db software to predict the suitable mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ito ##pe vaccine against the most known world population all ##eles through four selecting proteins such as s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and envelope protein and their modification sequences after the pan ##de ##mic spread of mer ##s - co ##v in 2012 . ie ##db services is one of the computational methods ; the output of this study showed that s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , envelope ( e ) protein , and s and e protein modified sequences of mer ##s - co ##v might be considered as a protective im ##mun ##ogenic with high con ##ser ##van ##cy because they can elect both neutral ##izing antibodies and t - cell responses when reacting with b - cell , t - help ##er cell , and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte . net ##ct ##l , net ##cho ##p , and m ##hc - np were used to confirm our results . population coverage analysis showed that the put ##ative help ##er t - cell ep ##ito ##pes and ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes could cover most of the world population in more than 60 geographical regions . according to all ##er ##hunter results , all those selected different protein showed non - all ##er ##gen ; this finding makes this computational vaccine study more desirable for vaccine synthesis .  
since its identification in the 1990s , the rna interference ( rna ##i ) pathway has proven extremely useful in el ##uc ##ida ##ting the function of proteins in the context of cells and even whole organisms . in particular , this sequence - specific and powerful loss - of - function approach has greatly simplified the study of the role of host cell factors implicated in the life cycle of viruses . here , we detail the rna ##i method we have developed and used to specifically knock down the expression of e ##z ##rin , an act ##in binding protein that was identified by yeast two - hybrid screening to interact with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) protein . this method was used to study the role of e ##z ##rin , specifically during the entry stage of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and its subsequent worldwide spread challenged the global public health community to confront a novel infectious disease . the infection is caused by a corona ##virus of animal origin . in this epidemic , molecular detection ##s of sar ##s corona ##virus rna were shown to be useful for the early diagnosis of sar ##s . although this pathogen was era ##dicated in humans , sar ##s or sar ##s - like viruses might re ##eme ##rge from animals or from laboratory incidents . in this chapter , we describe several polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) protocols for detecting sar ##s corona ##virus ##es . these ass ##ays were routinely used for clinical diagnosis during the sar ##s outbreak .  
the polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) , which can exponential ##ly replicate a target dna sequence , has formed the basis for the sensitive and direct examination of clinical samples for evidence of infection . during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 , pc ##r not only offered a rapid way to dia ##gno ##se sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection , but also made the molecular analysis of its gen ##omic sequence possible . sequence variations were observed in the sar - co ##v obtained from different patients in this epidemic . these unique viral genetic signatures can be applied as a powerful molecular tool in tracing the route of transmission and in studying the genome evolution of sar ##s - co ##v . to extract this wealth of information from the limited primary clinical specimens of sar ##s patients , we were presented with the challenge of efficiently amp ##li ##fying fragments of the sar ##s - co ##v genome for analysis . in this chapter , we will discuss how we managed to accomplish this task with our opt ##imi ##zed protocols on reverse ##tra ##ns ##cript ##ion , nest ##ed pc ##r amp ##li ##fication , and dna cycle sequencing . we will also discuss the sequence variations that ty ##pi ##fied some strains of sar ##s - co ##v in the different phases during this epidemic . pc ##r amp ##li ##fication of the viral sequence and gen ##omic sequencing of these critical sequence variations of re - emerging sar ##s - co ##v strains would give us quick insights into the virus .  
over the past two decades , several corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infectious clones have been engineered , allowing for the manipulation of their large viral genome ##s ( ~ 30 kb ) using unique reverse genetic systems . these reverse genetic systems include targeted rec ##om ##bina ##tion , in vitro liga ##tion , va ##cci ##nia virus vectors , and bacterial artificial chromosomes ( ba ##cs ) . quickly after the identification of middle east respiratory syndrome - co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , both in vitro liga ##tion and ba ##c - based reverse genetic technologies were engineered for mer ##s - co ##v to study its basic biological properties , develop live - at ##ten ##uated vaccines , and test anti ##vira ##l drugs . here , i will describe how lambda red rec ##om ##bina ##tion can be used with the mer ##s - co ##v ba ##c to quickly and efficiently introduce virtually any type of genetic modification ( point mutations , insertion ##s , del ##eti ##ons ) into the mer ##s - co ##v genome and recover rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus .  
the micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ( mn ) ass ##ay is a standard and important technique in vi ##rol ##ogy , im ##mun ##ology , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . it is a highly specific and sensitive ass ##ay for evaluating virus - specific neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) in human and animal sera . it provides the most precise answer to whether or not an individual or animal has antibodies that can neutral ##ize or inhibit the in ##fect ##ivity of a specific virus strain . however , using live virus - based mn ass ##ay might require working under high containment facilities especially when dealing with high - risk pathogen ##s such as the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . in this chapter , we describe the isolation , amp ##li ##fication , and ti ##tra ##tion of mer ##s - co ##v , as well as detailed mn ass ##ay to measure na ##b levels in sera from different mammalian species .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging zoo ##not ##ic pathogen with a broad host range . the extent of mer ##s - co ##v in nature can be traced to its adapt ##able cell entry steps . the virus can bind host - cell car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes as well as protein ##aceous receptors . following receptor interaction , the virus can utilize diverse host pro ##tea ##ses for cleavage activation of virus - host cell membrane fusion and subsequent genome delivery . the fusion and genome delivery steps can be completed at variable times and places , either at or near cell surfaces or deep within end ##oso ##mes . investigators focusing on the co ##vs have developed several method ##ologies that effectively distinguish these different cell entry pathways . here we describe these methods , highlighting virus - cell entry factors , entry inhibitors , and viral deter ##mina ##nts that specify the cell entry routes . while the specific methods described here ##in were utilized to reveal mer ##s - co ##v entry pathways , they are equally suited for other co ##vs , as well as other pro ##tea ##se - dependent viral species .  
first identified in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel virus that can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , multi ##org ##an failure , and death , with a case fatal ##ity rate of ~ 35 % . an animal model that supports mer ##s - co ##v infection and causes severe lung disease is useful to study pathogen ##esis and evaluate the ##ra ##pies and vaccines . the mu ##rine dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) protein is not a functional receptor for mer ##s - co ##v ; thus , mice are resistant to mer ##s - co ##v infection . we generated human d ##pp ##4 knock - in ( hd ##pp ##4 ki ) mice by replacing ex ##ons 10 – 12 at the mouse d ##pp ##4 locus with ex ##ons 10 – 12 from the human d ##pp ##4 gene . the resultant human d ##pp ##4 ki mice are per ##missive to mer ##s - co ##v ( hc ##ov - em ##c / 2012 strain ) infection but develop no disease . to generate a mouse model with associated mor ##bid ##ity and mortality from respiratory disease , we serial ##ly passage ##d hc ##ov - em ##c / 2012 strain in the lungs of young hd ##pp ##4 ki mice . after 30 in vivo passages , an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated mer ##s ( ma ) 6 . 1 . 2 . this virus clone produced significantly higher ti ##ters than the parental clone in the lungs of hd ##pp ##4 ki mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection . in this chapter , we will describe in detail the procedures used to mouse adapt mer ##s - co ##v by serial passage of the virus in lungs . we also describe the methods used to isolate virus clones and character ##ize virus infection .  
indirect enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) enables detection and quan ##ti ##fication of antigen - specific antibodies in biological samples such as human or animal sera . most current mer ##s - co ##v ser ##ological ass ##ays such as neutral ##ization , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , or protein micro ##ar ##ray rely on handling of live mer ##s - co ##v in high containment laboratories , highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and re ##age ##nts representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited . in this chapter , we describe a valid ##ated and opt ##imi ##zed indirect elisa protocol based on rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##1 subunit ( amino acids 1 – 72 ##5 ) of mer ##s - co ##v for qu ##ali ##tative and quantitative determination of mer ##s - co ##v - binding antibodies .  
in general , a whole vi ##rion serves as a simple vaccine antigen and often essential material for the analysis of immune responses against virus infection . however , to work with highly con ##tag ##ious pathogen ##s , it is necessary to take precautions against laboratory - acquired infection . we have learned many lessons from the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . in order to develop an effective vaccine and diagnostic tools , we prepared uv - inactivated sar ##s corona ##virus on a large scale under the strict bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 3 ( bs ##l ##3 ) regulation . our protocol for large - scale preparation of uv - inactivated sar ##s - co ##v including virus expansion , ti ##tra ##tion , ina ##ct ##ivation , and ultra ##cent ##ri ##fu ##gation is applicable to any newly emerging virus we might encounter in the future .  
since the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , more than 228 ##0 confirmed human infections and 800 associated deaths had been reported to the world health organization . mer ##s - co ##v is a single - stranded rna virus that belongs to the corona ##vir ##idae family . mer ##s - co ##v infection leads to a variety of clinical outcomes in humans ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mild infection to severe acute lung injury and multi - organ failure and death . to study the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v infection and development of medical counter ##me ##as ##ures ( mc ##ms ) for mer ##s , a number of genetically modified mouse models have been developed , including various versions of trans ##genic mice expressing the human d ##pp ##4 viral receptor . tracking and quan ##tify ##ing viral infection , among others , in per ##missive hosts is a key end ##point for studying mer ##s pathogen ##esis and evaluating the efficacy of selected mc ##ms developed for mer ##s . in addition to quan ##tify ##ing infectious pro ##geny virus which requires high - containment bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level ( bs ##l ) - 3 laboratory , here we outlined an established real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) - based procedure to une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly quan ##tify mer ##s - co ##v - specific rna ##s within the lungs of infected human d ##pp ##4 ( hd ##pp ##4 , trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 t ##g ) mice under a standard bs ##l - 2 laboratory .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) generate specialized membrane compartments , which consist of double membrane ve ##sic ##les connected to con ##vo ##lu ##ted membranes , the so - called replica ##tive structures , where viral rna synthesis takes place . these sites harbor the co ##v replication – transcription complexes ( rt ##cs ) : multi - protein complexes consisting of 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##ps ) , the co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) and presumably host proteins . to successfully establish functional membrane - bound rt ##cs all of the viral and host constituents need to be correctly spat ##iot ##em ##por ##ally organized during viral infection . few studies , however , have investigated the dynamic processes involved in the formation and functioning of the ( subunit ##s of ) co ##v rt ##cs and the replica ##tive structures in living cells . in this chapter we describe several protocols to perform time - laps ##e imaging of co ##v - infected cells and to study the kinetic ##s of ( subunit ##s of ) the co ##v replica ##tive structures . the approaches described are not limited to co ##v - infected cells ; they can also be applied to other virus - infected or non - infected cells .  
three - dimensional structures of the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein bound to cellular receptor and mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) have been determined by x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy , providing structural information about receptor recognition and neutral ##izing mechanisms of mab ##s at the atomic level . in this chapter , we describe the purification , crystal ##lization , and structure determination of the mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d .  
since 2012 , monthly cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continue to cause severe respiratory disease that is fatal in ~ 35 % of diagnosed individuals . the ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures have driven the development of animal models that can rep ##rod ##uc ##ibly replicate the pathology associated with mer ##s - co ##v in human infections . the inability of mer ##s - co ##v to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice , ham ##sters , and fe ##rret ##s st ##ym ##ied initial attempts to generate small animal models . identification of human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e iv ( hd ##pp ##4 ) as the receptor for mer ##s - co ##v infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice . precise molecular engineering of mouse d ##pp ##4 ( md ##pp ##4 ) with clustered regularly inter ##space ##d short pali ##nd ##rom ##ic repeats ( crisp ##r ) / cas ##9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles , and limited mer ##s - co ##v su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to tissues that naturally express md ##pp ##4 , notably the lower respiratory tract wherein mer ##s - co ##v eli ##cit ##s severe pulmonary pathology . here , we describe the generation of the 288 – 330 ( + / + ) mer ##s - co ##v mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v by modifying two amino acids on md ##pp ##4 ( a2 ##8 ##8 and t ##33 ##0 ) , and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s that cause fatal respiratory disease . the 288 – 330 ( + / + ) mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug , antibody , and vaccine therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures for mer ##s - co ##v . the chapter starts with a historical perspective on the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v and animal models evaluated for mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , and then outlines the development of the 288 – 330 ( + / + ) mouse model , ass ##ays for assessing a mer ##s - co ##v pulmonary infection in a mouse model , and describes some of the challenges associated with using genetically engineered mice .  
we analyzed genetic variations of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , considering that it might influence patients ' su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) or development of sar ##s as a functional receptor . by cl ##oning of the full ‐ length cd ##na of the ace ##2 gene in the lung , where replication occurs on sar ##s ‐ co ##v , it was shown that there are different sp ##lic ##ing sites . all ex ##ons including the new alternative ex ##on , ex ##on ‐ intro ##n boundaries , and the corresponding 5 ′ ‐ flanking region of the gene were investigated and 19 single nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) were found . out of these , 13 s ##np ##s including one non ‐ synonymous substitution and three 3 ′ ‐ ut ##r poly ##morphism ##s were newly identified . a case control study involving 44 sar ##s cases , 16 anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v antibody ‐ positive contacts , 87 antibody ‐ negative contacts , and 50 non ‐ contacts in vietnam , failed to obtain any evidence that the ace ##2 gene poly ##morphism ##s are involved in the disease process in the population . nevertheless , identification of new 5 ′ ‐ un ##tra ##ns ##lated ex ##on and new s ##np ##s is considered helpful in investigating regulation of ace ##2 gene expression in the future . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
given periodic outbreak ##s of fatal human infections caused by corona ##virus ##es , development of an optimal corona ##virus vaccine platform capable of rapid production is an ongoing priority . this chapter describes the use of an insect cell expression system for rapid production of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ) . detailed methods are presented for expression , purification , and release testing of sar ##s rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike protein antigen , followed by ad ##ju ##vant formulation and animal testing . the methods here ##in described for rapid development of a highly protective sar ##s vaccine are equally suited to rapid development of vaccines against other fatal human corona ##virus infections , e . g . , the mer ##s corona ##virus .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) comprise six sub ##type ##s of corona ##virus that are associated with a number of respiratory diseases such as common cold , pneumonia , and bro ##nch ##itis . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is one of these six hc ##ov sub ##type ##s . hc ##ov ##s can result in life - threatening respiratory diseases , such as pneumonia and bro ##nch ##iol ##itis , and may cause enter ##ic and ne ##uro ##logic diseases , especially in im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised patients . this narrative review aimed to en ##rich the knowledge of health care professional regarding mer ##s - co ##v infection ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , control , and management . this review discusses mer ##s - co ##v prevalence , clinical manifestation , modes of transmission , control measures , and management , which we identified in a search of various databases , related journals , and the published literature . it has been shown that mer ##s - co ##v infection is likely to be transmitted among countries . therefore , countries with a high rate of mer ##s - co ##v infection are urged to develop and implement guidelines to minimize the spread of infection . countries must give careful consideration to raising public awareness in regions that are affected by mer ##s - co ##v infection and the importance of reporting any disease signs and symptoms , to receive proper care .  
whole genome sequences of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 obtained from two patients , a chinese tourist visiting rome and an italian , were compared with sequences from europe and elsewhere . in a phylogenetic tree , the italian patient ’ s sequence clustered with sequences from germany while the tourist ’ s sequence clustered with other european sequences . some additional european sequences in the tree segregated outside the two clusters containing the patients ’ sequences . this suggests multiple sar ##s - co ##v - 2 introductions in europe or virus evolution during circulation .  
pseudo ##virus ##es are useful vi ##rol ##ogical tools because of their safety and versa ##tility , especially for emerging and re - emerging viruses . due to its high pathogen ##ici ##ty and in ##fect ##ivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutic ##s , live sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has to be handled under bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 3 conditions , which has hind ##ered the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s . based on a vs ##v pseudo ##virus production system , a pseudo ##virus - based neutral ##ization ass ##ay has been developed for evaluating neutral ##izing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 2 facilities . the key parameters for this ass ##ay were opt ##imi ##zed , including cell types , cell numbers , virus in ##oc ##ulum . when tested against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pseudo ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 con ##vale ##scent patient sera showed high neutral ##izing pot ##ency , which under ##sco ##re its potential as therapeutic ##s . the limit of detection for this ass ##ay was determined as 22 . 1 and 43 . 2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples . the cut ##off values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples , respectively . this ass ##ay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15 . 9 % and 16 . 2 % for the intra - and inter - ass ##ay analyses respectively . taken together , we established a robust pseudo ##virus - based neutral ##ization ass ##ay for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and are glad to share pseudo ##virus ##es and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutic ##s to fight against this lethal virus .  
[ image : see text ] co ##vid - 19 has spread globally since its discovery in hub ##ei province , china in december 2019 . a combination of computed tom ##ography imaging , whole genome sequencing , and electron microscopy were initially used to screen and identify sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the viral et ##iology of co ##vid - 19 . the aim of this review article is to inform the audience of diagnostic and surveillance technologies for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and their performance characteristics . we describe point - of - care diagnostic ##s that are on the horizon and encourage academics to advance their technologies beyond conception . developing plug - and - play diagnostic ##s to manage the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak would be useful in preventing future epidemic ##s .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside china with major outbreak ##s occurring in italy , south korea , and iran . phylogenetic analyses of whole - genome sequencing data identified a distinct sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clade linked to travellers returning from iran to australia and new zealand . this study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in iran , and under ##sco ##res the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases .  
with the first reports on corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the scientific community working in the field of type iii if ##ns ( if ##n - λ ) realized that this class of if ##ns could play an important role in this and other emerging viral infections . in this viewpoint , we present our opinion on the benefits and potential limitations of using if ##n - λ to prevent , limit , and treat these dangerous viral infections .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) can cause severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans and remains endemic in the middle east since first being identified in 2012 . there are currently no approved vaccines or the ##ra ##pies available for mer ##s - co ##v . in this study , we evaluated para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus 5 ( pi ##v ##5 ) - based vaccine expressing the mer ##s - co ##v envelope spike protein ( pi ##v ##5 / mer ##s - s ) in a human d ##pp ##4 knock ##in c ##57 ##bl / 6 cong ##eni ##c mouse model ( hd ##pp ##4 ki ) . following a single - dose intra ##nas ##al im ##mun ##ization , pi ##v ##5 - mer ##s - s induced neutral ##izing antibody and robust t cell responses in hd ##pp ##4 ki mice . a single intra ##nas ##al administration of 10 ( 4 ) p ##fu pi ##v ##5 - mer ##s - s provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v ( mer ##s ( ma ) 6 . 1 . 2 ) and improved virus clearance in the lung . in comparison , single - dose intra ##mus ##cular im ##mun ##ization with 10 ( 6 ) p ##fu uv - inactivated mer ##s ( ma ) 6 . 1 . 2 mixed with im ##ject al ##um provided protection to only 25 % of im ##mun ##ized mice . intriguing ##ly , an influx of e ##osi ##no ##phi ##ls was observed only in the lungs of mice im ##mun ##ized with inactivated mer ##s - co ##v , suggest ##ive of a hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity - type response . overall , our study indicated that pi ##v ##5 - mer ##s - s is a promising effective vaccine candidate against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
the last century has witnessed several assaults from rna viruses , resulting in millions of death throughout the world . the 21st century appears no longer an exception , with the trend continued with escalated fear of sar ##s corona ##virus in 2002 and further concern of influenza h ##5 ##n ##1 in 2003 . a novel influenza virus created the first pan ##de ##mic of the 21st century , the pan ##de ##mic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus , mer ##s - co ##v in 2012 . a novel corona ##virus “ sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ” ( and the disease co ##vid - 19 ) emerged suddenly , causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatal ##ity rate . this virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population , indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure . the big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out ? endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to in ##fect naive , as well as individual with pre - existing immunity . continuous monitoring is strongly ad ##vis ##able , not only to the newly infected individuals , but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as re - infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population .  
background : as part of the response plans for the current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow down transmission and reduce the infection rate . a solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals , reduce mis ##in ##form ##ation , and efficiently implement recommended measures . objective : the aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health ( m ##hea ##lth ) platform to di ##sse ##minate up - to - date and valid ##ated information about sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to all medical staff of the children ’ s hospital at the university hospitals of geneva . methods : three documents containing institutional information concerning screening , local containment procedures , and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the university of geneva , switzerland . using a third - party statistics tool , we anonymous ##ly monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in switzerland on february 25 , 2020 . results : from february 25 , 2020 , to march 13 , 2020 ( 18 days ) , information documents on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were viewed 85 ##9 times , which accounted for 35 . 6 % of the total content views ( total views = 332 ) . user activity increased significantly with 50 . 8 ( sd 14 . 4 ) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks ( mean 26 . 4 , sd 9 . 8 ; p < . 001 ) . in addition , session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period ( p < . 001 ) . in a survey , medical staff found the information easy to find within the app . on a 10 - point like ##rt scale , the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7 . 6 ( sd 2 . 1 ) , time - saving ability was rated as 8 . 5 ( sd 2 . 1 ) , and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5 . 9 ( sd 3 . 3 ) . conclusions : the use of an m ##hea ##lth solution to di ##sse ##minate novel corona ##virus – related information seemed to be an effective and time - saving communication channel within our institution during the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak . medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice . more research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of m ##hea ##lth solutions as a communication channel
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a human pathogen responsible for a severe respiratory illness that emerged in 2012 . structural information about the proteins that constitute the viral particle is scarce . in order to contribute to a better understanding of the nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ( n ) in charge of rna genome en ##cap ##si ##dation , the structure of the c ‐ terminal domain of n from mer ##s ‐ co ##v obtained using single ‐ crystal x ‐ ray di ##ff ##raction is reported here at 1 . 97 a resolution . the molecule is present as a dime ##r in the crystal structure and this ol ##igo ##mer ##ization state is confirmed in solution , as measured by additional methods including small ‐ angle x ‐ ray scattering measurements . comparisons with the structures of the c ‐ terminal domains of n from other corona ##virus ##es reveals a high degree of structural conservation despite low sequence conservation , and differences in electro ##static potential at the surface of the protein .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) infection has recently emerged as a cause of severe potentially fatal pneumonia . the clinical presentation ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection to severe pneumonia and acute renal failure . data on the clinical presentation in solid organ transplant recipients are lacking . we report two cases of mer ##s co ##v infections in two renal transplant recipients with variable clinical presentations and outcomes . the first patient presented with progressive respiratory symptoms , acute renal failure and died . while the second patient presented with respiratory tract symptoms , remained stable and had an excellent clinical recovery despite recent reception of thy ##mo ##gl ##ob ##ulin induction . this is a rare report of mer ##s co ##v infection in renal transplant recipients . further data are needed to gain better understanding of the impact of anti ‐ rejection im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive therapy on the clinical presentation , severity and outcome of mer ##s co ##v infections in solid organ transplant recipients .  
a go ‐ to solution : a simple graph ##ene oxide ( go ) ‐ based ass ##ay to screen for selective inhibitors of a hepatitis c virus ( hc ##v ) he ##lica ##se along with inhibitors of a severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) he ##lica ##se was tested ( see scheme ) . a single screen found five inhibitors highly selective for the hc ##v he ##lica ##se or ##th ##olo ##go ##us to the sar ##s co ##v he ##lica ##se . some of these hits were valid ##ated using the same go ‐ based ass ##ay .

healthcare workers ( hc ##w ) are potentially at increased risk of infection with corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) and may transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) to vulnerable patients . we present results from staff testing at sheffield teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust , united kingdom . between 16 and 29 march 2020 , 1 , 53 ##3 sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic hc ##w were tested , of whom 282 ( 18 % ) were positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . testing hc ##w is a crucial strategy to opt ##imi ##se staff ##ing levels during this outbreak .  
the world health organization has declared co ##vid - 19 caused by the newly discovered sar ##s - co ##v - 2 a pan ##de ##mic . due to growing demand for re ##age ##nts and / or kits to extract sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna for subsequent rt - q ##pc ##r diagnostic ##s , there is a worldwide risk of shortages . with a detection sensitivity of 97 . 4 % ( 95 % ci : 86 . 2 – 99 . 9 % ) , we describe a simple , fast , alternative work ##flow for molecular detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , where samples are simply heat - processed for 5 min at 98 °c before a commonly - used rt - q ##pc ##r procedure .  
the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus has very high in ##fect ##ivity , which allows it to spread rapidly around the world . attempts at slowing the pan ##de ##mic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed . we propose that the ol ##factory ep ##ith ##eli ##um from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus at the earliest stages , prior to onset of symptoms or even in as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic people , as compared to commonly used sp ##ut ##um or nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . here we emphasize that the nasal cavity ol ##factory ep ##ith ##eli ##um is the likely site of enhanced binding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . multiple non - ne ##uron ##al cell types present in the ol ##factory ep ##ith ##eli ##um express two host receptors , ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 pro ##tea ##ses , that facilitate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binding , replication , and accumulation . this may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with co ##vid - 19 . moreover , the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in ol ##factory neurons . in addition , we discuss the possibility that ol ##factory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease . we emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 actions in the nervous system , especially in the ol ##factory pathway .  
abstract : an effective severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) vaccine is likely to include components that can induce specific cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t ‐ l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ( ct ##l ) responses . the specific ##ities of such responses are governed by human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) ‐ restricted presentation of sar ##s ‐ derived peptide ep ##ito ##pes . exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigen ##s would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from gen ##omic / pro ##te ##omic sequence information ( lau ##em ##oll ##er et al . , rev im ##mun ##ogen ##et 2001 : 2 : 47 ##7 – 91 ) . the latter was recently established when a ca ##usa ##tive corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) was isolated and full ‐ length sequence ##d ( mar ##ra et al . , science 2003 : 300 : 139 ##9 – 404 ) . here , we have combined advanced bio ##in ##form ##atics and high ‐ through ##put im ##mun ##ology to perform an h ##la super ##type ‐ , genome ‐ wide scan for sar ##s ‐ specific ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes . the scan includes all nine human h ##la super ##type ##s in total covering > 99 % of all individuals of all major human populations ( set ##te & sidney , im ##mun ##ogen ##etic ##s 1999 : 50 : 201 – 12 ) . for each h ##la super ##type , we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in bio ##chemical binding ass ##ays . at this time ( approximately 6 months after the genome was established ) , we have tested the majority of the h ##la super ##type ##s and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates . these should be further valid ##ated in sar ##s survivors and used for vaccine formulation . we suggest that im ##mun ##ob ##io ##in ##form ##atics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design .  
the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by a previously unknown corona ##virus called sar ##s ‐ co ##v , had profound social and economic impacts worldwide . since then , structure – function studies of sar ##s ‐ co ##v proteins have provided a wealth of information that increases our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of sar ##s . while no effective therapy is currently available , considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . in this review , some of the notable achievements made by sar ##s structural biology projects worldwide are examined and strategies for therapeutic intervention are discussed based on available sar ##s ‐ co ##v protein structures . to date , 12 structures have been determined by x ‐ ray crystal ##log ##raphy or nm ##r from the 28 proteins encoded by sar ##s ‐ co ##v . one key protein , the sar ##s ‐ co ##v main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) , has been the focus of considerable structure ‐ based drug discovery efforts . this article highlights the importance of structural biology and shows that structures for drug design can be rapidly determined in the event of an emerging infectious disease .  
the ae ##ti ##ological agent of an emerge ##nt outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , is a positive ‐ stranded rna virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) belonging to the corona ##vir ##idae family with a genome that differs substantially from those of other known corona ##virus ##es . highly conserved he ##pta ##d ‐ repeat ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) regions in class i viral fusion proteins , including spike protein from sar ##s corona ##virus , interact with each other to form a six ‐ helix bundle , which is called a fusion core . the crystal structure of the fusion core is expected to greatly facilitate drug design . crystals of the fusion core of sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike protein have been grown at 291 k using peg 4000 as pre ##ci ##pit ##ant . the di ##ff ##raction pattern of the crystal extends to 2 . 8 a resolution at 100 k in ‐ house . the crystals have unit ‐ cell parameters a = 121 . 2 , b = 66 . 3 , c = 70 . 0 a , α = γ = 90 , β = 107 . 4 ##° and belong to space group c2 . assuming the presence of six molecules per as ##ym ##metric unit , the solvent content is estimated to be about 28 % .  
the ae ##ti ##olo ##gic agent of the recent epidemic ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a positive ‐ stranded rna virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) belonging to the corona ##vir ##idae family and its genome differs substantially from those of other known corona ##virus ##es . sar ##s ‐ co ##v is trans ##missible mainly by the respiratory route and to date there is no vaccine and no prop ##hyl ##actic or therapeutic treatments against this agent . a sar ##s ‐ co ##v whole ‐ genome approach has been developed aimed at determining the crystal structure of all of its proteins or domains . these studies are expected to greatly facilitate drug design . the genome ##s of corona ##virus ##es are between 27 and 31 . 5 kb ##p in length , the largest of the known rna viruses , and en ##code 20 – 30 mature proteins . the functions of many of these poly ##pe ##pt ##ides , including the ns ##p ##9 – ns ##p ##10 replica ##se ‐ cleavage products , are still unknown . here , the cl ##oning , es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli expression , purification and crystal ##lization of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ns ##p ##9 protein , the first sar ##s ‐ co ##v protein to be crystal ##lized , are reported . ns ##p ##9 crystals di ##ff ##rac ##t to 2 . 8 a resolution and belong to space group p ##6 ( 1 / 5 ) 22 , with unit ‐ cell parameters a = b = 89 . 7 , c = 136 . 7 a . with two molecules in the as ##ym ##metric unit , the solvent content is 60 % ( v ( m ) = 3 . 1 a ( 3 ) da ( − ##1 ) ) .  
the new type of pneumonia caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ) has been declared as a global public health concern by who . as of april 3 , 2020 , more than 1 , 000 , 000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world , which exhibited apparent person - to - person transmission characteristics of this virus . the capacity of vertical transmission in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 remains controversial recently . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is now confirmed as the receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission . in present study , we collected the online available single - cell rna sequencing ( sc ##rna - se ##q ) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ace ##2 in maternal - fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs . our results revealed that ace ##2 was highly expressed in maternal - fetal interface cells including st ##rom ##al cells and per ##iva ##scu ##lar cells of dec ##id ##ua , and cy ##to ##tro ##ph ##ob ##las ##t and sync ##yt ##iot ##rop ##ho ##bla ##st in place ##nta . meanwhile , ace ##2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart , liver and lung , but not in kidney . and in a study containing series fetal and post - natal mouse lung , we observed ace ##2 was dynamic ##ally changed over the time , and ace ##2 was extremely high in neon ##atal mice at post - natal day 1 ~ 3 . in summary , this study revealed that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal - fetal interface and fetal organs . and thus , both the vertical transmission and the place ##nta dysfunction / abortion caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice .  
the he ##lica ##se from severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) possesses nt ##pas ##e , du ##plex rna / dna ‐ un ##wind ##ing and rna ‐ cap ##ping activities that are essential for viral replication and proliferation . here , we have isolated dna apt ##ame ##rs against the sar ##s ‐ co ##v he ##lica ##se from a comb ##inator ##ial dna library . these apt ##ame ##rs show two distinct classes of secondary structure , g ‐ quad ##rup ##le ##x and non ‐ g ‐ quad ##rup ##le ##x , as shown by circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm and gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is . all of the apt ##ame ##rs that were selected stimulated atp ##ase activity of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v he ##lica ##se with low ‐ nano ##mo ##lar apparent k ( m ) values . intriguing ##ly , only the non ‐ g ‐ quad ##rup ##le ##x apt ##ame ##rs showed specific inhibition of he ##lica ##se activities , whereas the g ‐ quad ##rup ##le ##x apt ##ame ##rs did not inhibit he ##lica ##se activities . the non ‐ g ‐ quad ##rup ##le ##x apt ##ame ##r with the strongest inhibitor ##y pot ##ency was modified at the 3 ′ ‐ end with bio ##tin or inverted thy ##mi ##dine , and the modification increased its stability in serum , particularly for the inverted thy ##mi ##dine modification . structural diversity in selection coupled to post ‐ selection stab ##ilis ##ation has provided new insights into the apt ##ame ##rs that were selected for a he ##lica ##se target . these apt ##ame ##rs are being further developed to inhibit sar ##s ‐ co ##v replication .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ‐ corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic virus transmitted between animals and human beings . it causes mer ##s with high mortality rate . however , no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available . since anti ##vira ##l activity of some fl ##av ##ono ##ids is known , we applied a fl ##av ##ono ##id library to probe inhibitor ##y compounds against mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##c ‐ like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) . herb ##ace ##tin , iso ##ba ##vac ##hal ##con ##e , que ##rce ##tin 3 ‐ β ‐ d ‐ g ##lu ##cos ##ide and he ##lich ##rys ##eti ##n were found to block the en ##zy ##matic activity of mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . the binding of the four fl ##av ##ono ##ids was also confirmed independently using a try ##pt ##op ##han ‐ based flu ##orescence method . the systematic comparison of the binding affinity of fl ##av ##ono ##ids made it possible to in ##fer their sc ##af ##fold ##s and functional groups required to bind with mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . an induced ‐ fit docking analysis revealed that s ##1 and s ##2 sites play a role in interaction with fl ##av ##ono ##ids . the experimental and computational study showed that fl ##av ##ono ##l and cha ##lco ##ne are favourite sc ##af ##fold ##s to bind with the catalytic site of mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . it was also de ##duced that some fl ##av ##ono ##id derivatives with hydro ##phobic or car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te attached to their core structures have a good inhibitor ##y effect . therefore , we suggest that fl ##av ##ono ##ids with these characteristics can be used as template ##s to develop potent mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitors .  
atomic force microscopy has been used to probe the surface nano ##st ##ru ##cture ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . single crown ‐ like vi ##rion was directly visual ##ized and quantitative measurements of the dimensions for the structural proteins were provided . a corona of large , distinctive spikes in the envelope was measured after treatment with hydro ##xy ##oc ##tan ##oic acid . high ‐ resolution images revealed that the surface of each single sar ##s ‐ co ##v was surrounded with at least 15 spherical spikes having a diameter of 7 . 29 ± 0 . 73 nm , which is in close agreement with that of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s earlier predicted through the genome ##s of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . this study represents the first direct characterization of the surface ultra ##st ##ru ##cture ##s of sar ##s ‐ co ##v particles at the nano ##met ##re scale and offers new prospects for mapping viral surface properties .  
as with all viruses , the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) utilizes specific host cell factors during its infection cycle . some of these factors have been identified and are now increasingly sc ##rut ##ini ##zed as targets to intervene with infection . in this brief review , we describe the current understanding of how the sar ##s ‐ co ##v is able to use the cellular machinery for its replication .  
we have developed a new experimental system based on a micro ##fl ##uid ##ic chip to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . the system includes a laser ‐ induced flu ##orescence micro ##fl ##uid ##ic chip analyze ##r , a glass micro ##chi ##p for both polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) and cap ##illa ##ry electro ##ph ##ores ##is , a chip thermal cycle ##r based on dual pe ##lt ##ier the ##rm ##oe ##le ##ctric elements , a reverse transcription ‐ polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt ‐ pc ##r ) sar ##s diagnostic kit , and a dna electro ##ph ##ore ##tic si ##zing kit . the system allows efficient cd ##na amp ##li ##fication of sar ##s ‐ co ##v followed by electro ##ph ##ore ##tic si ##zing and detection on the same chip . to enhance the reliability of rt ‐ pc ##r on sar ##s ‐ co ##v detection , du ##plex pc ##r was developed on the micro ##chi ##p . the ass ##ay was carried out on a home ‐ made micro ##fl ##uid ##ic chip system . the positive and the negative control were cd ##na fragments of sar ##s ‐ co ##v and para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus , respectively . the test results showed that 17 positive samples were obtained among 18 samples of nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s from clinical ##ly diagnosed sar ##s patients . however , 12 positive results from the same 18 samples were obtained by the conventional rt ‐ pc ##r with ag ##aro ##se gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is detection . the sar ##s virus species can be analyzed with high positive rate and rapid ##ity on the micro ##fl ##uid ##ic chip system .  
background ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , a mono ##car ##box ##yla ##se that de ##grade ##s ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii to ang ##iot ##ens ##in 1 – 7 , is also the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) and is highly expressed in the lungs and heart . patients with sar ##s also suffered from cardiac disease including ar ##rh ##yt ##hmi ##as , sudden cardiac death , and sy ##sto ##lic and dia ##sto ##lic dysfunction . materials and methods we studied mice infected with the human strain of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v and en ##ce ##pha ##lom ##yo ##card ##itis virus and examined ace ##2 mrna and protein expression . autopsy heart samples from patients who succumbed to the sar ##s crisis in toronto ( canada ) were used to investigate the impact of sar ##s on my ##oca ##rdial structure , inflammation and ace ##2 protein expression . results pulmonary infection with the human sar ##s ‐ co ##v in mice led to an ace ##2 ‐ dependent my ##oca ##rdial infection with a marked decrease in ace ##2 expression confirming a critical role of ace ##2 in media ##ting sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection in the heart . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v viral rna was detected in 35 % ( 7 / 20 ) of auto ##ps ##ied human heart samples obtained from patients who succumbed to the sar ##s crisis during the toronto sar ##s outbreak . macro ##pha ##ge ‐ specific stain ##ing showed a marked increase in macro ##pha ##ge in ##filtration with evidence of my ##oca ##rdial damage in patients who had sar ##s ‐ co ##v in their hearts . the presence of sar ##s ‐ co ##v in the heart was also associated with marked reductions in ace ##2 protein expression . conclusions our data show that sar ##s ‐ co ##v can media ##te my ##oca ##rdial inflammation and damage associated with down ‐ regulation of my ##oca ##rdial ace ##2 system , which may be responsible for the my ##oca ##rdial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sar ##s .  
[ image : see text ] peptide inhibitors against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus , currently causing a worldwide pan ##de ##mic , are designed and simulated . the inhibitors are mostly formed by two sequential self - supporting α - he ##lices ( bundle ) extracted from the pro ##tea ##se domain ( pd ) of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which bind to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor binding domains . molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the α - he ##lica ##l peptide ##s maintain their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding ( blocking ) to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to provide a multi ##valent binding to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptors , many such peptide ##s could be attached to the surfaces of nano ##par ##tic ##le carriers . the proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutic ##s against the co ##vid - 19 disease .  
this review focuses on the important contributions that macro ##mo ##le ##cular crystal ##log ##raphy has made over the past 12 years to el ##uc ##ida ##ting structures and mechanisms of the essential pro ##tea ##ses of corona ##virus ##es , the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) and the papa ##in ‐ like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ( pro ) ) . the role of x ‐ ray crystal ##log ##raphy in structure ‐ assisted drug discovery against these targets is discussed . aspects dealt with in this review include the emergence of the sar ##s corona ##virus in 2002 – 2003 and of the mer ##s corona ##virus 10 years later and the origins of these viruses . the crystal structure of the free sar ##s corona ##virus m ( pro ) and its dependence on ph is discussed , as are efforts to design inhibitors on the basis of these structures . the mechanism of mat ##uration of the enzyme from the viral poly ##pro ##tein is still a matter of debate . the crystal structure of the sar ##s corona ##virus pl ( pro ) and its complex with u ##bi ##qui ##tin is also discussed , as is its or ##th ##olo ##gue from mer ##s corona ##virus . efforts at predict ##ive structure ‐ based inhibitor development for bat corona ##virus m ( pro ) s to increase the prepared ##ness against zoo ##not ##ic transmission to man are described as well . the paper closes with a brief discussion of structure ‐ based discovery of anti ##vira ##ls in an academic setting .  
in a previous study , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) was culture ##d in the presence of ban ##ani ##n , an effective adamant ##ane ‐ related molecule with anti ##vira ##l activity . in the present study , we show that all ban ##ani ##n ‐ resistant variants exhibit mutations in he ##lica ##se and membrane protein , although no evidence of ban ##ani ##n interference on their mutual interaction has been found . a structural analysis on protein sequence mutations found in sar ##s ‐ co ##v ban ##ani ##n ‐ resistant variants was performed . the s ##25 ##9 / l mutation of sar ##s ‐ co ##v he ##lica ##se is always found in all the identified ban ##ani ##n ‐ resistant variants , suggesting a primary role of this mutation site for ban ##ani ##n activity . from a structural analysis of sar ##s ‐ co ##v predicted he ##lica ##se structure , s ##25 ##9 is found in a hydro ##phi ##lic surface pocket , far from the enzyme active sites and outside the he ##lica ##se dime ##r interface . the s / l substitution causes a pocket volume reduction that weaken ##s the interaction between ban ##ani ##n and sar ##s ‐ co ##v mu ##tated he ##lica ##se , suggesting a possible mechanism for ban ##ani ##n anti ##vira ##l activity .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) causes the infectious disease co ##vid - 19 , which was first reported in wu ##han , china in december , 2019 . despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease , co ##vid - 19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pan ##de ##mic . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is thought to have originated in bats ; however , the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown . here , we investigated the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of fe ##rret ##s and animals in close contact with humans to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we found that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replicate ##s poorly in dogs , pigs , chickens , and ducks , but fe ##rret ##s and cats are per ##missive to infection . we found experimental ##ly that cats are susceptible to airborne infection . our study provides important insights into the animal models for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and animal management for co ##vid - 19 control .  
the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus has now become a pan ##de ##mic , but there is currently very little understanding of the antigen ##ici ##ty of the virus . we therefore determined the crystal structure of cr ##30 ##22 , a neutral ##izing antibody previously isolated from a con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patient , in complex with the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike ( s ) protein to 3 . 1 a . cr ##30 ##22 targets a highly conserved ep ##ito ##pe , distal from the receptor - binding site , that enables cross - reactive binding between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding ep ##ito ##pe can only be accessed by cr ##30 ##22 when at least two rb ##d on the trim ##eric s protein are in the “ up ” conform ##ation and slightly rotated . overall , this study provides molecular insights into antibody recognition of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreak ##s , most recently exemplified by the newly emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 . here ##in , we show that the rib ##on ##uc ##le ##osi ##de analog β - d - n ( 4 ) - hydro ##xy ##cy ##ti ##dine ( nh ##c , e ##id ##d - 1931 ) has broad spectrum anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , mer ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v , and related zoo ##not ##ic group 2 ##b or 2 ##c bat - co ##vs , as well as increased pot ##ency against a corona ##virus bearing resistance mutations to the nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog inhibitor re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir . in mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v , both prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic administration of e ##id ##d - 280 ##1 , an oral ##ly bio ##ava ##ila ##ble nh ##c - pro ##dr ##ug ( β - d - n ( 4 ) - hydro ##xy ##cy ##ti ##dine - 5 ′ - iso ##pro ##py ##l este ##r ) , improved pulmonary function , and reduced virus ti ##ter and body weight loss . decreased mer ##s - co ##v yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell rna , supporting a mechanism of lethal mu ##tage ##nes ##is in co ##v . the pot ##ency of nh ##c / e ##id ##d - 280 ##1 against multiple corona ##virus ##es and oral bio ##ava ##ila ##bility highlight its potential utility as an effective anti ##vira ##l against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other future zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es .  
it is urgent to understand the future of severe acute respiratory syndrome – corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) transmission . we used estimates of seasonal ##ity , immunity , and cross - immunity for beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es o ##c ##43 and hk ##u ##1 from time series data from the usa to inform a model of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission . we projected that rec ##urrent winter ##time outbreak ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 will probably occur after the initial , most severe pan ##de ##mic wave . absent other interventions , a key metric for the success of social di ##stan ##cing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded . to avoid this , prolonged or intermittent social di ##stan ##cing may be necessary into 202 ##2 . additional interventions , including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic , would improve the success of intermittent di ##stan ##cing and haste ##n the acquisition of herd immunity . longitudinal ser ##ological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . even in the event of apparent elimination , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in con ##tag ##ion could be possible as late as 202 ##4 .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a global health emergency . an attractive drug target among corona ##virus ##es is the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) , 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) , due to its essential role in processing the poly ##pro ##tein ##s that are translated from the viral rna . we report the x - ray structures of the un ##liga ##nded sar ##s - co ##v - 2 m ( pro ) and its complex with an α - ke ##to ##ami ##de inhibitor . this was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the p ##3 - p ##2 amid ##e bond incorporated into a p ##yr ##idon ##e ring to enhance the half - life of the compound in plasma . based on the structure , we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 m ( pro ) . the ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic characterization of the opt ##imi ##zed inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tr ##op ##ism and suit ##ability for administration by the in ##hala ##tive route .  
the current pan ##de ##mic corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory syndrome , co ##vid - 19 . to compare its pathogen ##esis with that of previously emerging corona ##virus ##es , we in ##oc ##ulated cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or mer ##s - co ##v and compared the pathology and vi ##rol ##ogy with historical reports of sar ##s - co ##v infections . in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected mac ##aq ##ues , virus was ex ##cre ##ted from nose and throat in the absence of clinical signs , and detected in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes in f ##oc ##i of diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage and in ci ##lia ##ted ep ##ith ##elial cells of nasal , bro ##nch ##ial , and bro ##nch ##iol ##ar mu ##cos ##ae . in sar ##s - co ##v - infection , lung lesions were typically more severe , while they were mild ##er in mer ##s - co ##v infection , where virus was detected mainly in type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . these data show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 causes co ##vid - 19 - like disease in mac ##aq ##ues , and provides a new model to test prevent ##ive and therapeutic strategies .  
aims : the pathogen ##esis , viral local ##ization and his ##top ##ath ##ological features of middle east respiratory syndrome – corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) in humans are not described sufficiently . the aims of this study were to explore and define the spectrum of his ##to ##logical and ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural path ##ological changes affecting various organs in a patient with mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection and represent a base of mer ##s ‐ co ##v his ##top ##ath ##ology . methods and results : we anal ##yse ##d the post ‐ mort ##em his ##top ##ath ##ological findings and investigated local ##isation of viral particles in the pulmonary and extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry tissue by transmission electron microscopic examination in a 33 ‐ year ‐ old male patient of t cell l ##ym ##ph ##oma , who acquired mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection . tissue needle bio ##ps ##ies were obtained from brain , heart , lung , liver , kidney and skeletal muscle . all samples were collected within 45 min from death to reduce tissue decomposition and arte ##fa ##ct . his ##top ##ath ##ological examination showed nec ##rot ##ising pneumonia , pulmonary diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , acute kidney injury , portal and lo ##bular hepatitis and my ##osi ##tis with muscle at ##rop ##hic changes . the brain and heart were his ##to ##logical ##ly un ##rem ##ark ##able . ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural ##ly , viral particles were local ##ised in the p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , pulmonary macro ##pha ##ges , renal pro ##xi ##mal tubular ep ##ith ##elial cells and macro ##pha ##ges in ##fi ##lt ##rating the skeletal muscles . conclusion : the results highlight the pulmonary and extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry path ##ological changes of mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection and provide the first evidence of the viral presence in human renal tissue , which suggests tissue tr ##op ##hism for mer ##s ‐ co ##v in kidney .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are implicated as reservoirs for the zoo ##not ##ic transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) with the respiratory route thought to be the main mode of transmission . knowledge and practices regarding mer ##s among herd ##ers , traders and slaughter ##house workers were assessed at at ##hi ‐ river slaughter ##house , kenya . question ##naire ##s were administered , and a check list was used to collect information on hygiene practices among slaughter ##house workers . of 22 persons , all washed hands after handling camel ##s , 82 % wore gum ##boot ##s , and 65 % wore overall ##s / dust ##coat ##s . none of the workers wore gloves or face ##mas ##ks during slaughter processes . fourteen percent reported drinking raw camel milk ; 90 % were aware of zoo ##not ##ic diseases with most reporting common ways of transmission as : eating improper ##ly cooked meat ( 90 % ) , drinking raw milk ( 68 % ) and slaughter processes ( 50 % ) . sixteen ( 73 % ) were unaware of mer ##s ‐ co ##v . use of personal protective clothing to prevent direct contact with discharge ##s and aero ##sol ##s was lacking . although few people working with camel ##s were interviewed , those met at this centralized slaughter ##house lacked knowledge about mer ##s ‐ co ##v but were aware of zoo ##not ##ic diseases and their transmission . these findings highlight need to di ##sse ##minate information about mer ##s ‐ co ##v and enhance hygiene and bio ##sa ##fe ##ty practices among camel slaughter ##house workers to reduce opportunities for potential virus transmission .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) cases without documented contact with another human mer ##s ‐ co ##v case make up 61 % ( 51 ##7 / 85 ##3 ) of all reported cases . these primary cases are of particular interest for understanding the source ( s ) and route ( s ) of transmission and for designing long ‐ term disease control measures . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for mer ##s ‐ co ##v and hence a potential source of human infections . however , only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camel ##s . other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food ‐ borne transmission through consumption of un ##pas ##te ##urized camel milk and raw meat , medicinal use of camel urine and zoo ##not ##ic transmission from other species . there are critical knowledge gaps around this new disease which can only be closed through traditional field ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease . since the 1960s , there has been a radical change in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel farming practices in the arabian peninsula with an int ##ens ##ification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities . it is possible that the recent int ##ens ##ification of camel herd ##ing in the arabian peninsula has increased the virus ' reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the ‘ urban ##ization ’ of camel herd ##ing increased the frequency of zoo ##not ##ic ‘ spill ##over ’ infections from camel ##s to humans . it is reasonable to assume , although difficult to measure , that the sensitivity of public health surveillance to detect previously unknown diseases is lower in east africa than in saudi arabia and that sporadic human cases may have gone und ##ete ##cted there .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by infection with a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) , was the first major novel infectious disease at the beginning of the 21st century , with china especially affected . sar ##s was characterized by high in ##fect ##ivity , mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , and the confined pattern of the disease spreading among the countries of south ‐ east and east asia suggested the existence of susceptible factor ( s ) in these populations . studies in the populations of hong kong and taiwan showed an association of human le ##uc ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) poly ##morphism ##s with the development and / or severity of sar ##s , respectively . the aim of the present study was to define the gen ##ot ##yp ##ic patterns of h ##la ‐ a , ‐ b and ‐ dr ##b ##1 lo ##ci in sar ##s patients and a co ‐ resident population of guangdong province , southern china , where the first sar ##s case was reported . the samples comprised 95 cases of recovered sar ##s patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls . h ##la ‐ a , ‐ b and ‐ dr ##b ##1 all ##eles were gen ##otype ##d using polymer ##ase chain reaction with sequence ‐ specific prime ##rs . the severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung in ##filtration , usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yt ##open ##ia . although the all ##eli ##c frequencies of a2 ##3 , a ##34 , b ##60 , dr ##b ##1 * 12 in the sar ##s group were slightly higher , and a ##33 , ‐ b ##58 and ‐ b ##6 ##1 were lower than in the controls , no statistical significance was found when the pc value was considered . similarly , no association of h ##la all ##eles with the severity of the disease was detected . thus , variations in the major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex are unlikely to have contributed significantly to either the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility or the severity of sar ##s in the population of guangdong .  
bats have been demonstrated to be natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) co ##v . fae ##cal samples from 248 individuals of 20 bat species were tested for partial rna ‐ dependent rna polymer ##ase gene of co ##v and 57 fae ##cal samples from eight bat species were tested positive . the highest detection rate of 44 % for sc ##oto ##phi ##lus ku ##hli ##i , followed by 30 % for rhino ##lo ##phus mono ##cer ##os . significantly higher detection rates of corona ##vira ##l rna were found in female bats and sc ##oto ##phi ##lus ku ##hli ##i ro ##ost ##ing in palm trees . phylogenetic analysis classified the positive samples into sar ##s ‐ related ( sar ##sr ) co ##v , sc ##oto ##phi ##lus bat co ##v 512 close to those from china and philippines , and mini ##op ##ter ##us bat co ##v 1a ‐ related lineage ##s . corona ##vira ##l rna was also detected in bat gu ##ano from sc ##oto ##phi ##lus ku ##hli ##i and my ##ot ##is form ##os ##us fl ##av ##us on the ground and had potential risk for human exposure . diverse bat co ##v with zoo ##not ##ic potential could be introduced by migratory bats and maintained in the endemic bat population in taiwan .  
bats are hosts of diverse corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) known to potentially cross the host – species barrier . for anal ##ys ##ing corona ##virus diversity in a bat species ‐ rich country , a total of 421 anal sw ##ab ##s / fae ##cal samples from costa rican bats were screened for co ##v rna ‐ dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) gene sequences by a pan ##cor ##ona ##virus pc ##r . six families , 24 genera and 41 species of bats were anal ##yse ##d . the detection rate for co ##v was 1 % . individuals ( n = 4 ) from four different species of fr ##ug ##ivo ##rous ( art ##ibe ##us jam ##ai ##cens ##is , carol ##lia per ##sp ##ici ##lla ##ta and carol ##lia cast ##ane ##a ) and nec ##tiv ##orous ( gloss ##op ##ha ##ga so ##ric ##ina ) bats were positive for corona ##virus ‐ derived nuclei ##c acids . analysis of 440 nt . rd ##rp sequences allocated all costa rican bat co ##vs to the α ‐ co ##v group . several co ##vs sequences clustered near previously described co ##vs from the same species of bat , but were phylogenetic ##ally distant from the human co ##v sequences identified to date , suggesting no recent spill ##over events . the gloss ##op ##ha ##ga so ##ric ##ina co ##v sequence is sufficiently di ##ssi ##mi ##lar ( 26 % homo ##logy to the closest known bat co ##vs ) to represent a unique corona ##virus not cluster ##ing near other co ##vs found in the same bat species so far , implying an even higher co ##v diversity than previously suspected .  
background : the association between weather and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) transmission in beijing and hong kong in the 2003 epidemic was studied to examine the effect of weather on sar ##s transmission . methods : pearson ’ s correlation analyses and negative bin ##omi ##al regression analyses were used to quan ##tify the correlation ##s between the daily newly reported number of sar ##s cases and weather variables , using daily disease notification data and meteorological data from the two locations . results : the results indicate that there were inverse association between the number of daily cases and maximum and / or minimum temperatures whereas air pressure was found to be positively associated with sar ##s transmission . conclusion : the study suggests that weather might be a contributor ##y factor in the 2003 sar ##s epidemic , in particular in the transmission among the community members .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is an emerging zoo ##not ##ic pathogen discovered in 2012 . the purpose of this sc ##oping review was to sum ##mar ##ize the empirical evidence for mer ##s ‐ co ##v in animals in order to map knowledge gaps and to extract data for modelling disease transmission in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . a review protocol was developed a prior ##i , and a systematic search , data extraction and summary were conducted using the ark ##sey and o ' malley framework . ninety ‐ nine publications were identified for full review out of 1 , 36 ##8 unique records . of these publications , 71 were articles in scientific journals . ninety of the studies were observation ##al and the remaining nine were experimental . we sum ##mar ##ize characteristics of animal studies including study design , study population and outcomes of interest for future transmission modelling in the reservoir population . the majority of field studies reported measures of prevalence , while experimental studies provided estimates of transmission parameters that per ##tain to the natural course of disease .  
introduction the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) infection can cause transmission clusters and high mortality in hem ##od ##ial ##ysis facilities . we attempted to develop a risk ‐ prediction model to assess the early risk of mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection in dial ##ysis patients . methods this two ‐ center retrospective co ##hort study included 104 dial ##ysis patients who were suspected of mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection and diagnosed with rr ##t ‐ pc ##r between september 2012 and june 2016 at king fa ##hd general hospital in jed ##dah and king abdul ##azi ##z medical city in ri ##yad ##h . we retrieved data on demographic , clinical , and radio ##logical findings , and laboratory indices of each patient . findings a risk ‐ prediction model to assess early risk for mer ##s ‐ co ##v in dial ##ysis patients has been developed . independent predict ##ors of mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection were identified , including chest pain ( or = 24 . 194 ; p = 0 . 01 ##1 ) , le ##uk ##open ##ia ( or = 6 . 08 ##0 ; p = 0 . 04 ##9 ) , and elevated as ##par ##tate amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( as ##t ) ( or = 11 . 179 ; p = 0 . 01 ##3 ) . the ad ##e ##qua ##cy of this prediction model was good ( p = 0 . 72 ##8 ) , with a high predict ##ive utility ( area under curve [ au ##c ] = 76 . 99 % ; 95 % ci : 67 . 05 % to 86 . 38 % ) . the prediction of the model had optimism ‐ corrected boots ##tra ##p res ##amp ##ling au ##c of 71 . 79 % . the you ##den index yielded a value of 0 . 43 ##9 or greater as the best cut ‐ off for high risk of mer ##s infection . discussion this risk ‐ prediction model in dial ##ysis patients appears to depend markedly on chest pain , le ##uk ##open ##ia , and elevated as ##t . the model accurately predict ##s the high risk of mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection in dial ##ysis patients . this could be clinical ##ly useful in applying timely intervention and control measures to prevent clusters of infections in dial ##ysis facilities or other health care settings . the predict ##ive utility of the model warrant ##s further validation in external samples and prospective studies .  
infections caused by the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) are a serious health issue due to their prevalence and associated mortality . however , the transmission routes of the virus remain unclear , and thus , the current recommended control strategies are not evidence based . in this study , we investigated the transmission routes of mer ##s ‐ co ##v during the first nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak in the republic of korea in may 2015 using a multi ‐ agent modeling framework . we identified seven h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized transmission modes based on the three main transmission routes ( long ‐ range airborne , close contact , and f ##omi ##te ) . the infection risks for each hypothesis were estimated using the multi ‐ agent modeling framework . least ‐ squares fitting was conducted to compare the distribution of the predicted infection risk in the various scenarios with that of the reported attack rates and to identify the h ##yp ##oth ##eses with the best fit . in the scenarios in which the index patient was a super ‐ spread ##er , our model simulations suggested that mer ##s ‐ co ##v probably spread via the long ‐ range airborne route . however , it is possible that the index patient shed an average viral load comparable to the loads reported in the literature , and that transmission occurred via a combined long ‐ range airborne and close contact route .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) can produce gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms . the int ##estinal tract is the only extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry site where viable viruses have been detected . this study examined seven established human int ##estinal cell lines , dl ##d ‐ 1 , hc ##t ‐ 116 , h ##t ‐ 29 , lo ##vo , l ##s ‐ 180 , sw ‐ 480 and sw ‐ 620 , for their per ##missive ##ness to sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . the results showed that only lo ##vo cells were per ##missive to sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection as evident by positive findings from indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing for intra ##cellular viral antigen ##s , in situ hybrid ##ization for intra ##cellular viral rna , and electron microscopy for intra ##cellular viral particles . in contrast to ve ##ro cells , sar ##s ‐ co ##v did not produce cy ##top ##athic effects on lo ##vo cells . however , lo ##vo cells were found to be highly per ##missive for productive infection with a high viral ti ##tre ( > 3 × 10 ( 7 ) viral copies / ml ) produced in culture super ##nat ##ant following a few days of inc ##uba ##tion . sar ##s ‐ co ##v established a stable persistent chronic infection that could be maintained after multiple passages . being a cell line of human origin , lo ##vo cells could be a useful in vitro model for studying the biology and persistent infection of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . our results on the expression of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , a recently identified cellular receptor for sar ##s ‐ co ##v , in these cell lines indicated that it might not be the sole deter ##mina ##nt for cells to be susceptible to sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . j . med . vi ##rol . 74 : 1 – 7 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease . its et ##iol ##ogical agent has been convincing ##ly identified as a new member of family corona ##vir ##idae ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . it causes serious damage to the respiratory system yet the mechanism is not clear . infection ‐ induced ap ##op ##tosis or nec ##rosis is suspected but no direct evidence for this yet exists . to date , ve ##ro e ##6 cells are the only cell line that could be used to replicate the virus with obvious cp ##e ( cy ##top ##athic effect ) in vitro . it is known for some viruses ( including members of family corona ##vir ##idae ) that cp ##e can be caused either by virus ‐ induced ap ##op ##tosis ( active death ) or cell nec ##rosis ( passive death ) . in this study , we examined the ap ##op ##tosis in the sar ##s ‐ co ##v infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . indeed , the results do show that the cp ##e was induced by ap ##op ##tosis rather than nec ##rosis , shown by typical dna fragmentation , through the existence of ap ##op ##to ##tic bodies and swollen mit ##och ##ond ##ria . this observation has some implications for the sar ##s ‐ co ##v pathogen ##ici ##ty : sar ##s ‐ co ##v does induce ap ##op ##tosis in cell cultures and might have the same effect in vivo , responsible for the severe damage of the respiratory system . j . med . vi ##rol . 73 : 323 – 331 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein fusion core consists of a six ‐ helix bundle with the three c ‐ terminal he ##pta ##d repeat ( hr ##2 ) he ##lices packed against a central coiled ‐ coil of the other three n ‐ terminal he ##pta ##d repeat ( hr ##1 ) he ##lices . each of the three peripheral hr ##2 he ##lices shows prominent contacts with the hydro ##phobic surface of the central hr ##1 coiled ‐ coil . the concert ##ed protein – protein interactions among the hr he ##lices are responsible for the fusion event that leads to the release of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id into the target host ‐ cell . in this investigation , we applied rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein and synthetic peptide ‐ based bio ##physical ass ##ays to character ##ize the biological activities of the hr he ##lices . in a parallel experiment , we employed a hiv ‐ luc / sar ##s pseudo ##type ##d virus entry inhibition ass ##ay to screen for potent inhibitor ##y activities on hr peptide ##s derived from the sar ##s ‐ co ##v s protein hr regions and a series of other small ‐ molecule drugs . three hr peptide ##s and five small ‐ molecule drugs were identified as potential inhibitors . ads ‐ j ##1 , which has been used to interfere with the fu ##so ##genesis of hiv ‐ 1 onto cd ##4 ( + ) cells , demonstrated the highest hiv ‐ luc / sar ##s pseudo ##type ##d virus ‐ entry inhibition activity among the other small ‐ molecule drugs . molecular modeling analysis suggested that ads ‐ j ##1 may bind to the deep pocket of the hydro ##phobic groove on the surface of the central coiled ‐ coil of sar ##s ‐ co ##v s hr protein and prevent the entrance of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v into the host cells . j . cell . bio ##che ##m . 104 : 233 ##5 – 234 ##7 , 2008 . © 2008 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
a high through ##put accurate ass ##ay for anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v i ##gg detection is needed for large ‐ scale ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies . the evaluation of a commercial rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ‐ based micro ##ti ##tre plate enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y , elisa ##rs ##™ is described . the results on 150 sera from sar ##s patients and 450 sera from non ‐ sar ##s controls showed that this ass ##ay had a high level of sensitivity ( 96 . 2 % for late serum samples ) and specific ##ity ( 97 . 8 % ) . the performance and setup of this ass ##ay fulfill ##s the requirement as a screening test for large ‐ scale studies . a vast majority of sar ##s patients developed antibodies against the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . in some patients ( 10 / 45 ) , a high level of anti ‐ nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antibody appeared very early in the course of the illness . in contrast , a minority ( 4 of 105 patients ) never developed these antibodies . the implication of differences in antibody response to the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein deserves further investigation . j . med . vi ##rol . 75 : 181 – 184 , 2005 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
background : the worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was caused by a novel corona ##virus called sar ##s ‐ co ##v . we report the use of dna ##zy ##me ( catalytic dna ) to target the 5 ′ ‐ un ##tra ##ns ##lated region ( 5 ′ ut ##r ) of a highly conserved fragment in the sar ##s genome as an approach to suppression of sar ##s ‐ co ##v replication . a mono ‐ dna enzyme ( d ##z ‐ 104 ) possessing the 10 – 23 catalytic motif was synthesized and tested both in vitro and in cell culture . materials and methods : sar ##s ‐ co ##v total rna was isolated , extracted from the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ w ##hu strain and converted into cd ##na . we designed a rna ‐ cl ##ea ##ving 10 – 23 dna ##zy ##me targeting at the loop region of the 5 ′ ut ##r of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the designed dna ##zy ##me , d ##z ‐ 104 , and its mutant version , d ##z ‐ 104 ( mu ##t ) , as a control consist of 9 + 9 arm sequences with a 10 – 23 catalytic core . in vitro cleavage was performed using an in vitro transcribed 5 ′ ut ##r rna substrate . a vector containing a fused 5 ′ ut ##r and enhanced green fluorescent protein ( e ##gf ##p ) was co ‐ trans ##fect ##ed with the dna ##zy ##me into e ##6 cells and the cells expressing e ##gf ##p were visual ##ized with flu ##orescence microscopy and analyzed by flu ##orescence ‐ activated cell sorting ( fa ##cs ) . results and conclusions : our results demonstrated that this dna ##zy ##me could efficiently cl ##ea ##ve the sar ##s ‐ co ##v rna substrate in vitro and inhibit the expression of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v 5 ′ ut ##r ‐ e ##gf ##p fusion rna in mammalian cells . this work presents a model system to rapidly screen effective dna ##zy ##mes targeting sar ##s and provides a basis for potential therapeutic use of dna enzymes to combat the sar ##s infection . copyright © 2007 john wiley & sons , ltd .  
few post ‐ mort ##em studies have been performed on patients who have died from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . no studies have examined how the sar ##s ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) loads in different organs with respect to time , post ‐ mort ##em . the aim of this study was to determine the quantitative temporal ‐ spatial distribution of sar ##s ‐ co ##v in the post ‐ mort ##em tissue samples of seven patients . quan ##ti ##tation of a house ‐ keeping gene , g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##de ‐ 3 ‐ phosphate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ( gap ##dh ) was undertaken to standard ##ize the amount of tissue tested . sar ##s ‐ co ##v viral load and sar ##s ‐ co ##v / gap ##dh rna ratio for each organ type were related to four time duration ##s : onset of illness to death , death to post ‐ mort ##em tissue sampling , and total duration ##s of treatment with rib ##avi ##rin and hydro ##cor ##tis ##one . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v / gap ##dh rna ratio remained relatively stable in most organ tissue types for all these time duration ##s . the ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bow ##el , whereas those for heart , liver , sp ##leen , and kidney were always less than one . it is concluded that sar ##s ‐ co ##v viral loads in these organs remain relatively stable , post ‐ mort ##em . this quantitative assessment further supports sar ##s ‐ co ##v has a specific tr ##op ##ism for the human respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tracts , which may be related to the density of sar ##s ‐ co ##v receptors . j . med . vi ##rol . 79 : 124 ##5 – 125 ##3 , 2007 . © wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) remains unclear . evidence based on bay ##esian scanning plots and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood ( ml ) and bay ##esian methods indicates that sar ##s ‐ co ##v , for the largest part of the genome ( [UNK] % ) , is more closely related to group ii corona ##virus ##es sequences , whereas in three regions in the or ##f ##1 ##ab gene it shows no apparent similarity to any of the previously characterized groups of corona ##virus ##es . there is disco ##rdan ##t phylogenetic cluster ##ing of sar ##s ‐ co ##v and corona ##virus ##es sequences , throughout the genome , compatible with either ancient rec ##om ##bina ##tion events or altered evolutionary rates in different lineage ##s , or a combination of both . j . med . vi ##rol . 74 : 36 ##9 – 37 ##2 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was caused by a newly identified corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) in 2003 . to detect early sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection , a one ‐ step , real ‐ time quantitative reverse transcription ‐ polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt ‐ pc ##r ) ass ##ay was developed that could simultaneously detect nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , membrane ( m ) , and spike ( s ) genes of sar ##s ‐ co ##v with the same pc ##r condition using either applied bio ##systems ( ab ##i ) prism 770 ##0 sequence detection system or roche light ##cycle ##r . the sensitivity of this ass ##ay was evaluated using cell culture ‐ derived viruses , in vitro transcribed viral rna , and clinical specimens . the sar ##s ‐ s , ‐ m , and ‐ n prime ##r / probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed s , m , and n rna per test using both the ab ##i and roche ass ##ay systems . the relative sen ##sit ##iv ##ities for detecting cell culture ‐ derived sar ##s ‐ co ##v were 0 . 01 , 0 . 01 , and 0 . 001 p ##fu / test , respectively . it showed that sar ##s ‐ n has comparable detection e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies to sar ##s ##2 and sar ##s ##3 which are prime ##rs sets designed by centers for disease control and prevention . in addition , sar ##s ‐ s and sar ##s ‐ m also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available real ##art hp ##a ‐ corona ##virus re ##age ##nts ( art ##us ) . the relative sensitivity of these prime ##r / probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed sar ##s patients . similar results as above were obtained . specific ##ity tests and sequence alignment showed that these prime ##r / probe sets anne ##ale ##d perfectly to 31 isolate ##s of sar ##s ‐ co ##v ; and there was no cross detection with other corona ##virus ##es and human respiratory tract ‐ associated viruses . therefore , not only is it compatible with the ab ##i and roche systems , this multiple ‐ gene detection ass ##ay also has the merit of being a rapid , safe , sensitive , and specific tool for accurate diagnosis of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . j . med . vi ##rol . 77 : 151 – 158 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by infection with the sar ##s ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) and characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation and fi ##bro ##sis . in this study , the development of auto ##ant ##ib ##odies against human ep ##ith ##elial cells and end ##oth ##elial cells in patients with sar ##s at different time periods ( the first week : phase i , 1 month after the disease onset : phase ii / phase iii ) were investigated . antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against : ( 1 ) a ##54 ##9 human pulmonary ep ##ith ##elial cell ‐ line , ( 2 ) human um ##bil ##ical ve ##nous end ##oth ##elial cells ( hu ##ve ##c ) , ( 3 ) primary human pulmonary end ##oth ##elial cells ( hp ##ec ) were detected by cell ‐ based elisa and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing . the results revealed that serum levels of i ##gg anti ‐ a ##54 ##9 cells antibodies , i ##gg anti ‐ hu ##ve ##c antibodies , and i ##gm anti ‐ hp ##ec antibodies were significantly higher in sar ##s patients at phase ii / phase iii than those in healthy controls . sera from sar ##s patients at phase ii / phase iii could media ##te complement dependent cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city against some a ##54 ##9 cells and hp ##ec . it is concluded that some auto ##ant ##ib ##odies against human ep ##ith ##elial cells and end ##oth ##elial cells would be developed after sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection and this phenomenon may indicate post ‐ infectious cellular injury and also induce sar ##s ‐ induced im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . j . med . vi ##rol . 77 : 1 – 7 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus which was responsible of the first case of human acute respiratory syndrome in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) , 2012 . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are considered as potential reservoirs for the virus and seem to be the only animal host which may transmit the infection to human . further studies are required to better understand the animal sources of zoo ##not ##ic transmission route and the risks of this infection . a primary ser ##o ‐ prevalence study of mer ##s ‐ co ##v pre ##ex ##ist ##ing neutral ##izing antibodies in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel serum was conducted in tab ##uk , western north region of ks ##a , in order to assess the seo ##po ##sit ##ivity of these animals and to explain their possible role in the transmission of the infection to human . one hundred seventy one ( 171 ) serum samples were collected from healthy dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s with different ages and gender ##s in tab ##uk city and tested for specific serum i ##gg by elisa using the receptor ‐ binding s ##1 subunit ##s of spike proteins of mer ##s ‐ co ##v . 144 ( 84 , 21 % ) of the total camel sera shown the presence of protein ‐ specific antibodies against mer ##s ‐ co ##v . these results may provide evidence that mer ##s ‐ co ##v has previously infected dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in tab ##uk and may support the possible role of camel ##s in the human infection .  
corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enter ##ic disease in humans and animals . in 2012 , a new human disease called middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) emerged in the middle east . mer ##s was caused by a virus that was originally called human corona ##virus ‐ erasmus medical center / 2012 but was later renamed as middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) . mer ##s ‐ co ##v causes high fever , cough , acute respiratory tract infection , and multi ##org ##an dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals . the exact origin of mer ##s ‐ co ##v remains unknown , but the transmission pattern and evidence from vi ##rol ##ogical studies suggest that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the major reservoir host , from which human infections may sporadic ##ally occur through the zoo ##not ##ic transmission . human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities . recent studies on middle eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus ‐ host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome . in this review , we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune eva ##sion strategies of mer ##s ‐ co ##v . we have demonstrated that m , 4a , 4 ##b proteins and pl ##pp ##ro of mer ##s ‐ co ##v inhibit the type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) and nuclear factor ‐ κ ##b signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune eva ##sion . in addition , non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 4a ( ns ##p ##4 ##a ) , ns ##p ##4 ##b , and ns ##p ##15 inhibit double ‐ stranded rna sensors . therefore , the mentioned proteins limit early induction of if ##n and cause rapid ap ##op ##tosis of macro ##pha ##ges . mer ##s ‐ co ##v strongly inhibit ##s the activation of t cells with down ##re ##gul ##ation of antigen presentation . in addition , un ##con ##tro ##lled secret ##ion of inter ##fer ##on ɣ ‐ induced protein 10 and mono ##cy ##te che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t protein ‐ 1 can suppress proliferation of human my ##elo ##id pro ##gen ##itor cells .  
bs ##t ##2 / te ##ther ##in , an inter ##fer ##on ‐ ind ##ucible anti ##vira ##l factor , can block the cellular release of various enveloped viruses . we previously reported that human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov ‐ 229 ##e ) infection can alleviate the bs ##t ##2 te ##ther ##ing of hiv ‐ 1 vi ##rion ##s by down ##re ##gul ##ating cell surface bs ##t ##2 , suggesting that corona ##virus ##es are capable of encoding anti ‐ bs ##t ##2 factors . here we report our new finding that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , similar to vp ##u , is capable of ant ##ago ##ni ##zing the bs ##t ##2 te ##ther ##ing of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , hc ##ov ‐ 229 ##e , and hiv ‐ 1 virus ‐ like particles via bs ##t ##2 down ##re ##gul ##ation . however , unlike vp ##u ( which down ##mo ##du ##lates bs ##t ##2 by means of pro ##tea ##som ##al and l ##ys ##osomal degradation pathways ) , bs ##t ##2 down ##re ##gul ##ation is apparently mediated by sar ##s ‐ co ##v s through the l ##ys ##osomal degradation pathway only . we found that sar ##s ‐ co ##v s col ##oca ##lized with both bs ##t ##2 and reduced cell surface bs ##t ##2 , suggesting an association between sar ##s ‐ co ##v s and bs ##t ##2 that targets the l ##ys ##osomal degradation pathway . according to one recent report , sar ##s ‐ co ##v or ##f ##7 ##a ant ##ago ##ni ##zes bs ##t ##2 by interfering with bs ##t ##2 g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion ( 1 ) . our data provide support for the proposal that sar ##s ‐ co ##v and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving supplementary anti ‐ bs ##t ##2 factors in a manner that requires virus replication . further experiments are required to determine whether the bs ##t ##2 ‐ mediated restriction of authentic sar ##s ‐ co ##v vi ##rion ##s is alleviate ##d by the sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike protein .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) leads to severe injury in the lungs with multiple factors , though the pathogen ##esis is still largely unclear . this paper describes the particular analyses of the transcript ##ome of human lung tissue that was infected by sar ##s ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . random prime ##rs were used to produce est ##s from total rna samples of the lung tissue . the result showed a high diversity of the transcript ##s , covering much of the human genome , including lo ##ci which do not contain protein coding sequences . 10 , 80 ##1 est ##s were generated and assembled into 267 con ##ti ##gs plus 7 , 65 ##9 singleton ##s . sequences matching to sar ##s ‐ co ##v rna ##s and other pneumonia ‐ related micro ##bes were found . the transcript ##s were well classified by functional ann ##ota ##tion . among the 7 , 87 ##2 assembled sequences that were identified as from human genome , 57 ##8 non ‐ coding genes were revealed by blast search . the transcript ##s were mapped to the human genome with the restriction of identity = 100 % , which found a candidate pool of 44 ##8 novel transcription ##al lo ##ci where est transcription ##al signal was never found before . among these , 13 lo ##ci were never reported to be transcription ##al by other detection methods such as gene chips , til ##ing arrays , and paired ‐ end di ##tag ##s ( pets ) . the result showed that random ‐ pri ##ming cd ##na library is valid for the investigation of transcript diversity in the virus ‐ infected tissue . the est data could be a useful supplemental source for sar ##s pathology researches . j . med . vi ##rol . 83 : 57 ##4 – 58 ##6 , 2011 . © 2011 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) is the ae ##ti ##ological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . because of the critical role played by ser ##ological ass ##ays for sar ##s diagnosis , an in ‐ house elisa based on sar ##s ‐ co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nt antigen ##s was developed . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) , three n fragments ( n ##1 , n ##2 , and n ##3 ) and the intra ##vira ##l domain of the membrane protein ( m2 ) were clone ##d and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli as his ##ti ##dine ‐ tagged proteins . six reference sera from sar ##s patients were used to detect virus ‐ specific i ##gg in an elisa using each rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein as coating antigen . high ‐ ti ##tre positive reactions were detected in all sar ##s positive sera . the specific ##ity of the ass ##ay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non ‐ sar ##s , low ‐ tract respiratory infections . specific hyper ‐ immune sera to sar ##s ‐ co ##v and the rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins , n , n ##1 , n ##2 , n ##3 , and m2 were also generated in mice and rabbits . the specific ##ity of these sera was confirmed by an im ##mun ##oc ##yt ##oche ##mic ##al ass ##ay on bio ##chi ##ps of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infected and un ##in ##fect ##ed cells . j . med . vi ##rol . 76 : 137 – 142 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) in ##fect ##s many organs , such as lung , liver , and immune organs and causes life ‐ threatening at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , sar ##s causes high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality rates . the molecular mechanism of sar ##s pathogen ##esis remains elusive . inflammatory stimuli can activate i ##κ ##b kinase ( ik ##k ) signals ##ome and subsequently the nuclear factor kappa b ( n ##f ‐ κ ##b ) , which influences gene expression of cy ##cl ##oo ##xy ##genase ‐ 2 ( cox ‐ 2 ) along with other transcription factors . in this work , we found that the membrane ( m ) protein of sar ##s ‐ co ##v physically interact ##ed with ik ##k ##β using a co ‐ im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay ( ipa ) . expression of m suppressed tumor nec ##rosis factor alpha ( tn ##f ‐ α ) induced n ##f ‐ κ ##b activation using a lucifer ##ase reporter ass ##ay . further investigation showed m protein suppressed cox ‐ 2 expression using a lucifer ##ase reporter gene ass ##ay , rt ‐ pc ##r and western b ##lot analysis . the car ##box ##yl terminal of m protein was sufficient for the m protein function . together , these results indicate that sar ##s ‐ co ##v m suppress ##es n ##f ‐ κ ##b activity probably through a direct interaction with ik ##k ##β , resulting in lower cox ‐ 2 expression . suppression of n ##f ‐ κ ##b activity and cox ‐ 2 expression may contribute to sar ##s pathogen ##esis . j . med . vi ##rol . 79 : 143 ##1 – 143 ##9 , 2007 . © wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the aim of the study was to establish the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) in host cells and determine the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s . ve ##ro e ##6 cells ( african green monkey kidney cells ) were in ##oc ##ulated with sar ##s corona ##virus for 3 , 7 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hr , respectively , and were observed under electron microscope . it was found that the sar ##s corona ##virus entered the cells through membrane fusion instead of end ##oc ##yt ##osis , and then the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##ids assembled in the re ##r and mature ##d by bud ##ding into the smooth ve ##sic ##les , which were derived from the go ##l ##gi apparatus . the smooth ve ##sic ##les fused with the cell membrane , and the mature particles were released . a special phenomenon was that some virus ‐ like particles appeared in the nucleus . we propose a scheme of the life cycle of sar ##s corona ##virus and discuss the mechanism of its replication in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . j . med . vi ##rol . 73 : 332 – 337 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
int ##eg ##rin ##s are critical for initiating t ‐ cell activation events . the int ##eg ##rin ‐ binding motif ar ##g ‐ g ##ly ‐ as ##p ( r ##g ##d ) was incorporated into the pc ##dna 3 . 1 mammalian expression vector expressing the cod ##on ‐ opt ##imi ##zed extra ##cellular domain of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) spike protein , and tested by im ##mun ##izing c ##57 ##bl / 6 mice . significant cell ‐ mediated immune responses were characterized by cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t ‐ l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ( 51 ) cr release ass ##ay and inter ##fer ##on ‐ gamma secret ##ion eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ay against rm ##a ‐ s target cells presenting predicted m ##hc class i h ##2 ‐ kb ep ##ito ##pes , including those spanning residues 88 ##4 – 89 ##1 and 111 ##6 – 112 ##3 within the s ##2 subunit of sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike protein . dna vaccines incorporating the spike ‐ r ##g ##d / his motif or the spike ‐ his construct generated robust cell ‐ mediated immune responses . moreover , the spike ‐ his dna vaccine construct generated a significant antibody response . im ##mun ##ization with these dna vaccine construct ##s eli ##cite ##d significant cellular and humor ##al immune responses . additional t ‐ cell ep ##ito ##pes within the sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike protein that may contribute to cell ‐ mediated immunity in vivo were also identified . j . med . vi ##rol . 81 : 113 ##1 – 113 ##9 , 2009 . © 2009 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is poorly understood and cy ##tok ##ine d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation has been suggested as one relevant mechanism to be explored . we compared the cy ##tok ##ine profile in ca ##co ##2 cells after infection of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) with other respiratory viruses including respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus ( rs ##v ) , influenza a virus ( flu ##av ) , and human para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus type 2 ( hp ##iv ##2 ) . inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) system ( production and response ) was not suppressed by sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . therefore , sar ##s ‐ co ##v replication was suppressed by pre ##tre ##at ##ment with if ##n . sar ##s ‐ co ##v and rs ##v induced high levels of il ‐ 6 and ran ##tes compared with flu ##av and hp ##iv ##2 . induction level of suppress ##or of cy ##tok ##ine signaling ‐ 3 ( soc ##s ##3 ) by sar ##s ‐ co ##v was significantly lower than that by rs ##v in spite of the significant production of il ‐ 6 . toll ‐ like receptors 4 and 9 , which co ##rre ##late with the induction of inflammatory response , were up ##re ##gul ##ated by sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . collectively , over ##ind ##uc ##tion of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine and d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of cy ##tok ##ine signaling may contribute to the im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology associated with “ severe ” inflammation in sar ##s . j . med . vi ##rol . 78 : 417 – 42 ##4 , 2006 . © 2006 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ‐ corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s . the s protein of sar ##s ‐ co ##v is a major target for neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) in infected patients . we developed a neutral ##ization ass ##ay using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) bearing sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ s protein ( vs ##v ‐ sar ##s ‐ st ##19 ) . a total of 56 serum samples collected from 22 healthcare workers in the hanoi french hospital during the sar ##s epidemic in 2003 were evaluated and compared to the conventional neutral ##izing ass ##ay using infectious sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the results of the neutral ##ization ass ##ay using vs ##v ‐ sar ##s ‐ st ##19 pseudo ##type showed good correlation ##s with those using infectious sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the newly developed neutral ##ization ass ##ay was more sensitive to low antibody ti ##ters in serum samples . thus , the vs ##v ‐ sar ##s ‐ st ##19 is a useful tool for detecting na ##bs against sar ##s ‐ co ##v . j . med . vi ##rol . 78 : 150 ##9 – 151 ##2 , 2006 . © 2006 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is an emerging virus that poses a major challenge to clinical management . the 3 ##c ‐ like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) is essential for viral replication and thus represents a potential target for anti ##vira ##l drug development . presently , very few data are available on mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibition by small molecules . we conducted extensive exploration of the ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##oric space of a recently identified set of pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitors of the bat hk ##u ##4 ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . hk ##u ##4 ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) shares high sequence identity ( 81 % ) with the mer ##s ‐ co ##v enzyme and thus represents a potential sur ##rogate model for anti ‐ mer ##s drug discovery . we used 2 well ‐ established methods : quantitative structure ‐ activity relationship ( q ##sar ) ‐ guided modeling and docking ‐ based comparative inter ##mo ##le ##cular contacts analysis . the established ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore models highlight structural features needed for ligand recognition and revealed important binding ‐ pocket regions involved in 3 ##cl ( pro ) ‐ ligand interactions . the best models were used as 3d que ##ries to screen the national cancer institute database for novel non ##pe ##pt ##ido ##mi ##met ##ic 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibitors . the identified hits were tested for hk ##u ##4 ‐ co ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibition . two hits , which share the ph ##en ##yl ##sul ##fo ##nami ##de fragment , showed moderate inhibitor ##y activity against the mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) and represent a potential starting point for the development of novel anti ‐ mer ##s agents . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore modeling study supported by in vitro validation on the mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . highlights : mer ##s ‐ co ##v is an emerging virus that is closely related to the bat hk ##u ##4 ‐ co ##v . 3 ##cl ( pro ) is a potential drug target for corona ##virus infection . hk ##u ##4 ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) is a useful sur ##rogate model for the identification of mer ##s ‐ co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) enzyme inhibitors . db ##cic ##a is a very robust modeling method for hit identification . the ph ##en ##yl ##sul ##fo ##nami ##de sc ##af ##fold represents a potential starting point for mer ##s corona ##virus 3 ##cl ( pro ) inhibitors development .  
most of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease . here , we characterized temporal changes in n protein ‐ specific and s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ‐ specific neutral ##izing antibody ( na ##b ) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both n protein ‐ specific and s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ‐ specific na ##b responses , suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected patients . j . med . vi ##rol . 78 : 1 – 8 , 2006 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
high through ##put ass ##ays for anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v i ##gg antibody detection are need for large ‐ scale ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic studies . the performance of a micro ##plate enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y , detect ‐ sar ##s ##™ , was evaluated for the detection of anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v i ##gg antibody . this ass ##ay is based on synthetic peptide ##s derived from the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike proteins . the results showed that the ass ##ay provided a high degree of sensitivity ( 95 . 9 % ) for con ##vale ##scent serum samples . the level of specific ##ity was close to 90 % , and did not show significant variation among different control groups . the high degree of sensitivity together with the high ‐ through ##put nature makes it advantage ##ous as a screening ass ##ay for studies where handling of a large number of specimens is required . j . med . vi ##rol . 74 : 51 ##7 – 520 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
the first reported case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) infection was identified in saudi arabia in september 2012 , since which time there have been over 2000 laboratory ‐ confirmed cases , including 750 deaths in 27 countries . nuclei ##c acid testing ( nat ) is the preferred method for the detection of mer ##s ‐ co ##v . a single round of a proficiency testing program ( pt ##p ) was used to assess the capability of laboratories globally to accurately detect the presence of mer ##s ‐ co ##v using nat . a panel of eleven l ##yo ##phi ##lized specimens containing different viral loads of mer ##s ‐ co ##v , common corona ##virus ##es , and in vitro rna transcript ##s was distributed to laboratories in all six world health organization regions . a total of 96 laboratories from 79 countries participating in the pt ##p , with 76 of 96 ( 79 . 2 % ) reporting correct mer ##s ‐ co ##v results for all nine scored specimens . a further 10 laboratories ( 10 . 4 % ) scored correctly in eight of nine specimens of the pt ##p . the majority of laboratories demonstrated satisfactory performance in detecting the presence of mer ##s ‐ co ##v using nat . however , some laboratories require improved ass ##ay sensitivity , reduced cross contamination of samples , and improved spec ##iation of corona ##virus sub ##type ##s for potentially complex clinical specimens . further pt ##p and enhanced links with expert laboratories globally may improve the laboratory performance .  
the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of the middle east respiratory corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) facilitates receptor binding and cell entry . during investigation of a multi ‐ facility outbreak of mer ##s ‐ co ##v in tai ##f , saudi arabia , we identified a mixed population of wild ‐ type and variant sequences with a large 530 nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on in the spike gene from the serum of one patient . the out of frame del ##eti ##on predicted loss of most of the s ##2 subunit of the spike protein leaving the s ##1 subunit with an intact receptor binding domain . this finding documents human infection with a novel genetic variant of mer ##s ‐ co ##v present as a quasi ##sp ##ec ##ies . j . med . vi ##rol . 89 : 54 ##2 – 54 ##5 , 2017 . © 2016 wiley periodicals , inc .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . it is an enveloped , single ‐ stranded , plus ‐ sense rna virus with a genome of [UNK] kb . the structural proteins e , m and n of sar ##s ‐ co ##v play important roles during host cell entry and viral mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis and release . therefore , we have studied whether expression of these structural proteins can be down ‐ regulated using an anti ##sen ##se technique . methods : ve ##ro e ##6 cells were trans ##fect ##ed with pl ##as ##mi ##d construct ##s containing ex ##ons of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v structural protein e , m or n genes or their ex ##ons in frame with the reporter protein e ##gf ##p . the trans ##fect ##ed cell cultures were treated with anti ##sen ##se ph ##os ##ph ##oro ##thi ##oat ##ed ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide ##s ( anti ##sen ##se ps ‐ o ##d ##n , 20 ##mer ) or a control ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide by addition to the culture medium . results : among a total of 26 anti ##sen ##se ps ‐ o ##d ##ns targeting e , m and n genes , we obtained six anti ##sen ##se ps ‐ o ##d ##ns which could sequence ‐ specifically reduce target genes expression by over 90 % at the concentration of 50 µ ##m in the cell culture medium tested by rt ‐ pc ##r . the anti ##sen ##se effect was further proved by down ‐ regulating the expression of the fusion proteins containing the structural proteins e , m or n in frame with the reporter protein e ##gf ##p . in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , the anti ##sen ##se effect was dependent on the concentrations of the anti ##sen ##se ps ‐ o ##d ##ns in a range of 0 – 10 µ ##m or 0 – 30 µ ##m . conclusions : the anti ##sen ##se ps ‐ o ##d ##ns are effective in down ##re ##gul ##ation of sar ##s . the findings indicate that anti ##sen ##se knock ##down of sar ##s could be a useful strategy for treatment of sar ##s , and could also be suitable for studies of the path ##ological function of sar ##s genes in a cellular model system . copyright © 2004 john wiley & sons , ltd .  
a number of human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) were reported in the last and present centuries . some outbreak ##s of which ( e ##g , sar ##s and mer ##s co ##vs ) caused the mortality of hundreds of people worldwide . the problem of finding a potent drug against hc ##ov strains lies in the inability of finding a drug that stops the viral replication through inhibit ##ing its important proteins . in spite of its limited efficacy and potential side effects , rib ##avi ##rin is extensively used as a first choice against hc ##ov ##s . therefore , scientists reverted towards the investigation of different drugs that can more specifically target proteins . in this study , four anti ‐ hc ##v drugs ( one approved by fda and others under clinical trials ) are tested against hc ##ov polymer ##ase ##s . quantitative structure ‐ activity relationship ( q ##sar ) and molecular docking are both used to compare the performance of the selected nu ##cle ##otide inhibitors to their parent nu ##cle ##otide ##s and rib ##avi ##rin . both q ##sar and molecular docking showed that id ##x ‐ 184 is superior compared to rib ##avi ##rin against mer ##s co ##v , a result that was also reported for hc ##v . mk ‐ 06 ##0 ##8 showed a performance that is comparable to rib ##avi ##rin . we strongly suggest an in vitro study on the pot ##ency of these two drugs against mer ##s co ##v .  
a ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##olo ##gic study was conducted in north china in 2003 to determine the neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) con ##vale ##scent sera . a total of 99 sar ##s con ##vale ##scent serum samples were collected from patients from the inner mongolia autonomous region , he ##bei province , and beijing 35 – 180 days after the onset of symptoms . the anti ‐ sar ##s antibodies were detected by enzyme ‐ linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , neutral ##ization ass ##ay , and western b ##lot . eighty ‐ seven serum samples were confirmed to be positive for sar ##s antibodies . the neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter of the 87 positive sera was analyzed quantitative ##ly by neutral ##ization ass ##ay . the geometric mean ti ##ter ( gm ##t ) of the 87 con ##vale ##scent sera was 1 : 61 . the ko ##lm ##ogo ##rov – sm ##ir ##nov test showed that the neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters conform to normal distribution , which suggests that the average anti ‐ sar ##s antibody level in this study was representative of the con ##vale ##scent antibody level of the sar ##s population . this result could be useful for the development and quality control of sar ##s vaccines . j . med . vi ##rol . 77 : 147 – 150 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) exhibits a high mortality rate and the potential for rapid epidemic spread . additionally , it has a poorly defined clinical presentation , and no known treatment or prevention methods . collectively , these factors under ##sco ##re the need for early diagnosis . molecular tests have been developed to detect sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) rna using real time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt ‐ pc ##r ) with varying levels of sensitivity . however , rna amp ##li ##fication methods have been demonstrated to be more sensitive for the detection of some rna viruses . we therefore developed a real ‐ time nuclei ##c acid sequence ‐ based amp ##li ##fication ( nas ##ba ) test for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . a number of prime ##r / beacon sets were designed to target different regions of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v genome , and were tested for sensitivity and specific ##ity . the performance of the ass ##ays was compared with rt ‐ pc ##r ass ##ays . a multi ‐ target real ‐ time nas ##ba application was developed for detection of sar ##s ‐ co ##v polymer ##ase ( pol ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) genes . the n targets were found to be consistently more sensitive than the pol targets , and the real ‐ time nas ##ba ass ##ay demonstrates equivalent sensitivity when compared to testing by real ‐ time rt ‐ pc ##r . a multi ‐ target real ‐ time nas ##ba ass ##ay has been successfully developed for the sensitive detection of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . j . med . vi ##rol . 77 : 60 ##2 – 60 ##8 , 2005 . © 2005 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
sar ##s ‐ co ##v is a newly identified corona ##virus ( co ##v ) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein is an important structural and functional protein . to identify cellular proteins that interact with the sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein and to el ##uc ##ida ##te the possible involvement of n protein in sar ##s ‐ co ##v pathogen ##esis , a human l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte cd ##na library was screened using a yeast two ‐ hybrid system ass ##ay . hub ##c ##9 , a u ##bi ##qui ##tin con ##ju ##gating enzyme of sumo ##yla ##tion system , was found to interact specifically with the n protein , implying the post ‐ translation ##al sumo ##yla ##tion of the n protein . mapping studies localized the critical n sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170 – 210 , which includes the sr ‐ rich motif . however , the consensus motif of sumo ##yla ##tion g ##k ( 62 ) ee in the n protein is not responsible for binding to hub ##c ##9 . mutations of hub ##c ##9 at the enzyme active site c ##9 ##3 ##a or c ##9 ##3 ##s severely imp ##air the interaction with the n protein . the two proteins were also shown to col ##oca ##li ##ze in the cy ##top ##las ##m of the trans ##fect ##ed 293 ##t cells . this is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hub ##c ##9 with a structural protein of plus ‐ strand rna viruses , indicating a new drug target for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . j . med . vi ##rol . 78 : 136 ##5 – 137 ##3 , 2006 . © 2006 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ‐ co ##v is a newly emerging virus that causes sar ##s with high mortality rate in infected people . to study the humor ##al responses against sar ##s ‐ co ##v , we evaluated nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and spike ( s ) proteins ‐ specific antibodies in patients ' sera by western b ##lot ##ting and enzyme ‐ linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . rec ##om ##bina ##nt n and s proteins of sar ##s ‐ co ##v were pu ##rified from transformed e . coli . serum specimens from 40 sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected patients in the con ##vale ##scent phase were analyzed by western b ##lot ##ting using the pu ##rified antigen ##s . serial serum specimens from 12 rt ‐ pc ##r ‐ confirmed sar ##s patients were ass ##ay ##ed by elisa using the rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein as coated antigen . by western b ##lot ##ting , 97 . 5 % of the sar ##s patients were positive for n protein ‐ specific antibodies whereas only 47 . 5 % of the samples were positive for s protein ‐ specific antibodies . using n protein ‐ based elisa , 10 out of the 12 patients were positive for n protein ‐ specific antibodies and 6 of them showed ser ##oco ##n ##version at mean of 16 days after onset of fever . im ##mun ##ob ##lot ##ting was useful for detecting the humor ##al immune response after sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . antibodies against sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein appear at the early stage of infection , therefore , n protein ‐ based elisa could serve as a simple , sensitive , and specific test for dia ##gno ##sing sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . j . med . vi ##rol . 73 : 338 – 34 ##6 , 2004 . © 2004 wiley ‐ li ##ss , inc .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a serious health threat and its early diagnosis is important for infection control and potential treatment of the disease . diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods , of which a capture elisa method may be useful . toward this goal , we have prepared and characterized soluble full ‐ length nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins ( n protein ) from sar ##s and 229 ##e human corona ##virus ##es . n proteins form ol ##igo ##mers , mostly as dime ##rs at low concentration . these two n proteins de ##grade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded n protein is the c ‐ terminal fragment of amino acid ( aa ) 169 – 422 . taken together with other data , we suggest that n protein is a two ‐ domain protein , with the n ‐ terminal aa 50 – 150 as the rna ‐ binding domain and the c ‐ terminal aa 169 – 422 as the dime ##rization domain . poly ##cl ##onal antibodies against the sar ##s n protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti ‐ nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1 – 20 , aa 150 – 170 and aa 390 – 410 . these sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from sar ##s patients . the sar ##s anti ‐ np antibody was able to clearly detect sar ##s virus grown in ve ##ro e ##6 cells and did not cross ‐ react with the np from the human corona ##virus 229 ##e . we have predicted several antigen ##ic sites ( 15 – 20 amino acids ) of s , m and n proteins and produced antibodies against those peptide ##s , some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from sar ##s patients . antibodies against the np peptide ##s could detect the co ##gna ##te n protein clearly . further ref ##ine ##ment of these antibodies , particularly large ‐ scale production of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies , could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with sar ##s and other human corona ##virus ##es .  
abstract : the previously unknown corona ##virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) affected more than 8 , 000 persons worldwide and was responsible for more than 700 deaths during the first outbreak in 2002 – 2003 . for reasons unknown , the sar ##s virus is less severe and the clinical progression a great deal mild ##er in children younger than 12 years of age . in contrast , the mortality rate can exceed 50 % for persons at or above the age of 60 . as part of the sino ‐ european project on sar ##s diagnostic ##s and anti ##vira ##ls ( sep ##sd ##a ) , an immune ph ##age ‐ display library is being created from con ##vale ##scent patients in a ph ##age ##mi ##d system for the selection of single ‐ chain fragment variables ( sc ##f ##v ) antibodies recognizing the sar ##s ‐ co ##v .  
the authors have previously shown that acute lung injury ( ali ) produces a wide spectrum of path ##ological processes in patients who die of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and that the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein is detect ##able in the lungs , and other organs and tissues , in these patients . in the present study , im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry ( i ##hc ) and in situ hybrid ##ization ( is ##h ) ass ##ays were used to anal ##yse the expression of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike ( s ) protein , and some pro ‐ inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines ( pic ##s ) including mc ##p ‐ 1 , t ##gf ‐ β ##1 , tn ##f ‐ α , il ‐ 1 ##β , and il ‐ 6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of sar ##s . sar ##s ‐ co ##v s protein and its rna were only detected in ace ##2 ( + ) cells in the lungs and other organs , indicating that ace ##2 ‐ expressing cells are the primary targets for sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection in vivo in humans . high levels of pic ##s were expressed in the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected ace ##2 ( + ) cells , but not in the un ##in ##fect ##ed cells . these results suggest that cells infected by sar ##s ‐ co ##v produce elevated levels of pic ##s which may cause im ##mun ##o ‐ mediated damage to the lungs and other organs , resulting in ali and , subsequently , multi ‐ organ dysfunction . therefore application of pic antagonist ##s may reduce the severity and mortality of sar ##s . copyright © 2006 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
abstract : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly found infectious disease that is caused by a novel human corona ##virus , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . because the mortality rate of sar ##s patients is very high , understanding the path ##ological mechanisms of sar ##s not only in vivo but in vitro is important for the prevention of sar ##s . activation of signaling pathways caused by sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection leads to the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and activation of downstream molecules . two conflicting cellular programs , ap ##op ##tosis to eliminate virus ‐ infected cells and survival to delay ap ##op ##tosis by producing anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ines , occur in sar ##s patients . recent studies regarding sar ##s and sar ##s ‐ co ##v have clarified that activation of mit ##ogen ‐ activated protein kinase ##s ( map ##ks ) plays important roles in up ##re ##gul ##ation of cy ##tok ##ine expression and ap ##op ##tosis both in vitro and in vivo . both ak ##t and p ##38 map ##k are keys for determination of cell survival or death in sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected cells in vitro . agents being developed to target these signaling cascade ##s may be important for the design of anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v drugs . this review highlights recent progress regarding sar ##s ‐ co ##v biology , especially signal trans ##duction in sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ infected cells .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route . a distinct corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) has been identified as the ae ##ti ##ological agent of sar ##s . recently , a metal ##lo ##pe ##pt ##ida ##se named ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been identified as the functional receptor for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . although ace ##2 mrna is known to be present in virtually all organs , its protein expression is largely unknown . since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogen ##esis and future treatment strategies for sar ##s , the present study investigated the local ##ization of ace ##2 protein in various human organs ( oral and nasal mu ##cos ##a , nas ##op ##har ##yn ##x , lung , stomach , small int ##est ##ine , colon , skin , l ##ym ##ph nodes , thy ##mus , bone marrow , sp ##leen , liver , kidney , and brain ) . the most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ace ##2 protein on lung al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells and enter ##ocytes of the small int ##est ##ine . furthermore , ace ##2 was present in arterial and ve ##nous end ##oth ##elial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied . in conclusion , ace ##2 is abundant ##ly present in humans in the ep ##ith ##elia of the lung and small int ##est ##ine , which might provide possible routes of entry for the sar ##s ‐ co ##v . this ep ##ith ##elial expression , together with the presence of ace ##2 in vascular end ##oth ##eli ##um , also provides a first step in understanding the pathogen ##esis of the main sar ##s disease manifestation ##s . copyright © 2004 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new infectious disease with a global impact . understanding its pathogen ##esis and developing specific diagnostic methods for its early diagnosis are crucial for the effective management and control of this disease . by using pro ##te ##omic technology , truncated forms of α ( 1 ) ‐ anti ##try ##ps ##in ( t ##f ‐ α ( 1 ) ‐ at ) were found to increase significantly and consistently in sera of sar ##s patients compared to control subjects . the result showed a sensitivity of 100 % for sar ##s patients and a specific ##ity of 92 . 8 % for controls . furthermore , the levels of these proteins significantly correlated with certain clinic ##o ‐ path ##ological parameters . the dramatic increase in t ##f ‐ α ( 1 ) ‐ at may be the result of degradation of α ( 1 ) ‐ at . as α ( 1 ) ‐ at plays an important role in the protection of lung function , its degradation may be an important factor in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s . these findings indicate that increased t ##f ‐ α ( 1 ) ‐ at may be therapeutic ##ally relevant , and may also be a useful biological marker for the diagnosis of sar ##s .  
we previously identified the major path ##ological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) but gained little information on the organ distribution of sar ##s ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . in the present study , we used a mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibody specific for sar ##s ‐ co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein , and probe ##s specific for a sar ##s ‐ co ##v rna polymer ##ase gene fragment , for im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry and in situ hybrid ##ization , respectively , to detect sar ##s ‐ co ##v systematically in tissues from patients who died of sar ##s . sar ##s ‐ co ##v was found in lung , tr ##ache ##a / bro ##nch ##us , stomach , small int ##est ##ine , distal con ##vo ##lu ##ted renal tub ##ule , sweat gland , para ##thy ##roid , pit ##uit ##ary , pan ##cre ##as , ad ##ren ##al gland , liver and ce ##re ##br ##um , but was not detected in o ##es ##op ##ha ##gus , sp ##leen , l ##ym ##ph node , bone marrow , heart , ao ##rta , ce ##re ##bell ##um , thyroid , test ##is , o ##vary , ut ##erus or muscle . these results suggest that , in addition to the respiratory system , the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract and other organs with detect ##able sar ##s ‐ co ##v may also be targets of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . the path ##ological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cy ##top ##athic effect mediated by local replication of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection . in addition to viral spread through a respiratory route , sar ##s ‐ co ##v in the int ##estinal tract , kidney and sweat glands may be ex ##cre ##ted via fae ##ces , urine and sweat , thereby leading to virus transmission . this study provides important information for understanding the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways . this data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of sar ##s . copyright © 2004 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of sar ##s . previously , sar ##s co ##v 3 ##c ‐ like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) has been demonstrated to induce ap ##op ##tosis via the activation of cas ##pas ##e ‐ 3 and cas ##pas ##e ‐ 9 ( lin , c . w . , lin , k . h . , hs ##ie ##h , t . h . , shi ##u , s . y . et al . , fe ##ms im ##mun ##ol . med . micro ##bio ##l . 2006 , 46 , 375 – 380 ) . in this study , pro ##te ##ome analysis of the human promo ##no ##cy ##te h ##l ‐ c ##z cells expressing sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro was performed using 2 ‐ de and nano ##sca ##le cap ##illa ##ry lc / es ##i quad ##rup ##ole ‐ to ##f ms . functional classification of identified up ‐ regulated proteins indicated that protein metabolism and modification , particularly in the u ##bi ##qui ##tin pro ##tea ##some pathway , was the main biological process occurring in sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro ‐ expressing cells . thirty ‐ six percent of identified up ‐ regulated proteins were located in the mit ##och ##ond ##ria , including ap ##op ##tosis ‐ inducing factor , atp synth ##ase beta chain and cy ##to ##chrome c ox ##ida ##se . interesting ##ly , heat shock co ##gna ##te 71 ‐ k ##da protein ( hs ##p ##70 ) , which ant ##ago ##ni ##zes ap ##op ##tosis ‐ inducing factor was shown to down ‐ regulate and had a 5 . 29 ‐ fold decrease . in addition , con ##fo ##cal image analysis has shown release of mitochondrial ap ##op ##to ##genic ap ##op ##tosis ‐ inducing factor and cy ##to ##chrome c into the cy ##tos ##ol . our results revealed that sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro could be considered to induce mitochondrial ‐ mediated ap ##op ##tosis . the study provides system ‐ level insights into the interaction of sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro with host cells , which will be helpful in el ##uc ##ida ##ting the molecular basis of sar ##s co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus . children appear to be less susceptible to the sar ##s corona ##virus , although the other non ‐ sar ##s corona ##virus ##es can cause respiratory infections in adults and in children of all ages . the exact reasons as to why sar ##s prefer ##ential ##ly affects adults , and not children , are still unknown . many h ##yp ##oth ##eses exist and need to be explored . during the outbreak of sar ##s , there did not appear to be an increase in asthma ex ##ace ##rba ##tions in children .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) mostly cause a common cold that is mild and self ‐ limiting . zoo ##not ##ic transmission of co ##vs such as the recently identified middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) ‐ co ##v and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ‐ co ##v , on the other hand , may be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection . this article reviews the clinical and path ##ological data available on mer ##s and compares it to sar ##s . most importantly , chest radio ##graphs and imaging results of patients with mer ##s show features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia , different from the lesions in sar ##s patients , which show fi ##bro ##cellular intra ‐ al ##ve ##olar organization with a bro ##nch ##iol ##itis ob ##lite ##ran ##s organizing pneumonia ‐ like pattern . these findings are in line with differences in the induction of cy ##top ##ath ##ological changes , induction of host gene responses and sensitivity to the anti ##vira ##l effect of inter ##fer ##ons in vitro when comparing both mer ##s ‐ co ##v and sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the challenge will be to translate these findings into an integrated picture of mer ##s pathogen ##esis in humans and to develop intervention strategies that will eventually allow the effective control of this newly emerging infectious disease . copyright © 2014 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new human infectious disease with significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . the disease has been shown to be associated with a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . the clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological aspects of sar ##s have been described . moreover , the viral genome of sar ##s ‐ co ##v has been fully sequence ##d . however , much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tr ##op ##ism of sar ##s ‐ co ##v are limited . in this study , six fatal cases of sar ##s were investigated for the tissue and cellular tr ##op ##ism of sar ##s ‐ co ##v using an in ‐ situ hybrid ##ization ( is ##h ) technique . among all the tissues studied , positive signals were seen in p ##ne ##um ##ocytes in the lungs and surface enter ##ocytes in the small bow ##el . infected p ##ne ##um ##ocytes were further confirmed by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence – flu ##orescence in ‐ situ hybrid ##ization ( fish ) analysis . these results provide important information concerning the tissue tr ##op ##ism of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , which is distinct from previously identified human corona ##virus ##es , and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection . whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , the gut was relatively intact . these findings indicated that tissue responses to sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection are distinct in different organs . copyright © 2004 john wiley & sons , ltd .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a new corona ##virus , sar ##s ‐ co ##v . pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra ‐ pulmonary manifestation ##s are also common . factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection remains unclear . ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , and ace ##2 protein expression , reveal new insights into the pathogen ##esis of this deadly disease . ace ##2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , namely p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and surface enter ##ocytes of the small int ##est ##ine . despite the fact that sar ##s ‐ co ##v can in ##fect the lung and int ##est ##ine , the tissue responses in these two organs are different . all other tissues and cell types expressing ace ##2 may be potential targets of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . remarkably , end ##oth ##elial cells , which express ace ##2 to a high level , have not been shown to be infected by sar ##s ‐ co ##v . there is also evidence that cell types without detect ##able ace ##2 expression may also be infected by the virus . furthermore , studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ace ##2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection . therefore , other virus receptors or co ‐ receptors may be required in different tissues . moreover , the interaction between sar ##s ‐ co ##v and the im ##mun ##ological or l ##ym ##ph ##oid system remains to be defined . it is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s . as our knowledge of the pathogen ##ic mechanisms improves , a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease . copyright © 2004 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
a new sar ##s animal model was established by in ##oc ##ulating sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) into r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca mu ##lat ##ta ) through the nasal cavity . path ##ological pulmonary changes were successively detected on days 5 – 60 after virus in ##oc ##ulation . all eight animals showed a transient fever 2 – 3 days after in ##oc ##ulation . im ##mun ##ological , molecular biological , and path ##ological studies support the establishment of this sar ##s animal model . firstly , sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ specific i ##ggs were detected in the sera of mac ##aq ##ues from 11 to 60 days after in ##oc ##ulation . secondly , sar ##s ‐ co ##v rna could be detected in ph ##ary ##nge ##al sw ##ab samples using nest ##ed rt ‐ pc ##r in all infected animals from 5 days after virus in ##oc ##ulation . finally , his ##top ##ath ##ological changes of inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia were found in the lungs during the 60 days after viral in ##oc ##ulation : these changes were less marked at later time points , indicating that an active healing process together with resolution of an acute inflammatory response was taking place in these animals . this animal model should provide insight into the mechanisms of sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ related pulmonary disease and greatly facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s against sar ##s . copyright © 2005 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .

recently , a new corona ##virus was isolated from the lung tissue of autopsy sample and nasal / throat sw ##ab ##s of the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and the ca ##usa ##tive association with sar ##s was determined . to reveal further the characteristics of the virus and to provide insight about the molecular mechanism of sar ##s et ##iology , a pro ##te ##omic strategy was utilized to identify the structural proteins of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) isolated from ve ##ro e ##6 cells infected with the b ##j ‐ 01 strain of the virus . at first , western b ##lot ##ting with the con ##vale ##scent sera from sar ##s patients demonstrated that there were various structural proteins of sar ##s ‐ co ##v in the culture ##d super ##nat ##ant of virus infected ‐ ve ##ro e ##6 cells and that nu ##cle ##oca ##sp ##id ( n ) protein had a prominent im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity to the con ##vale ##scent sera from the patients with sar ##s , while the immune response of spike ( s ) protein probably binding with membrane ( m ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was much weaker . then , sodium dod ##ec ##yl sulfate ‐ poly ##ac ##ryl ##ami ##de gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is ( sd ##s ‐ page ) was used to separate the complex protein constituents , and the strategy of continuous slicing from loading well to the bottom of the gel ##s was utilized to search thoroughly the structural proteins of the virus . the proteins in sliced slots were try ##ps ##ini ##zed in ‐ gel and identified by mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry . three structural proteins named s , n and m proteins of sar ##s ‐ co ##v were uncovered with the sequence coverage of 38 . 9 , 93 . 1 and 28 . 1 % respectively . g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion modification in s protein was also analyzed and four g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after de ##gly ##cos ##yla ##tion of the peptide ##s with p ##nga ##se f digest ##ion . matrix ‐ assisted laser des ##or ##ption / ion ##ization ‐ mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry determination showed that relative molecular weight of intact n protein is 45 92 ##9 da , which is very close to its theoretically calculated molecular weight 45 93 ##5 da based on the amino acid sequence de ##duced from the genome with the first amino acid met ##hi ##oni ##ne at the n ‐ terminus depleted and second , ser ##ine , ace ##ty ##lated , indicating that ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation does not happen at all in the predicted ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation sites within infected cells nor in virus particles . intriguing ##ly , a series of shorter iso ##forms of n protein was observed by sd ##s ‐ page
abstract : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century that has been highly trans ##missible and fatal and was caused by a previously unknown corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . the sar ##s epidemic in 2003 resulted in more than 840 ##0 sar ##s cases and approximately 800 deaths . existing in non ‐ identified animal reservoirs , sar ##s ‐ co ##v continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of sar ##s , and no new cases have been reported . however , we cannot exclude the possibility of re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of sar ##s . it is hence necessary to understand the biology of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v to deal adequately with the next outbreak , whenever it happens . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v is a novel corona ##virus with a large ( [UNK] thousand nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) positive ‐ sense , single ‐ stranded rna containing 14 functional open reading frames ( or ##fs ) of which 2 large or ##fs constitute the replica ##se gene which en ##codes proteins required for viral rna synth ##eses . the remaining 12 or ##fs en ##code the 4 structural proteins : spike , membrane , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and envelope ; and eight accessory proteins . the viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translation ##al and en ##zy ##matic processing to form the 4 structural , 8 accessory and 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins . in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or caps ##id assembly and viral pathogen ##esis , laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions . it has been our effort to consolidate all information known to date about the molecular mechanisms of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v into this chapter to update our readers ##hip on the current status of research .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a severe infectious disease that has affected many countries and regions since 2002 . a novel member of the corona ##virus , sar ##s ‐ co ##v , has been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent . however , the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s is still elusive . in this study , we used 2 ‐ d dig ##e and ms to analyze the protein profiles of plasma from sar ##s patients , in the search for pro ##te ##omic alterations associated with the disease progression , which could provide some clues to the pathogen ##esis . to en ##rich the low ‐ abundance proteins in human plasma , two highly abundant proteins , album ##in and i ##gg , were first removed . by comparing the plasma proteins of sar ##s patients with those of a normal control group , several proteins with a significant alteration were found . the up ‐ regulated proteins were identified as alpha ‐ 1 acid g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , ha ##pt ##og ##lo ##bin , alpha ‐ 1 anti ‐ ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in and fe ##tu ##in . the down ‐ regulated proteins were ap ##oli ##pop ##rot ##ein a ‐ i , transfer ##rin and trans ##thy ##ret ##in . most of the proteins showed significant changes ( up ‐ or down ‐ regulated ) in the progressive phase of disease , and there was a trend back to normal level during the con ##vale ##scent phase . among these proteins , the alterations of fe ##tu ##in and anti ‐ ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in were further confirmed by western b ##lot ##ting . since all the up ‐ regulated proteins identified above are well ‐ known inflammation inhibitors , these results strongly suggest that the body starts inflammation inhibition to sustain the inflammatory response balance in the progression of sar ##s .  
the previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has ended . however , many questions concerning how the ae ##ti ##ological agent , the novel sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , causes illness in humans remain una ##ns ##wer ##ed . the pathology of fatal cases of sar ##s is dominated by diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage . specific his ##to ##logical changes are not detected in other organs . these contrast remarkably with the clinical picture , in which there are apparent manifestation ##s in multiple organs . both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s . the choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen . for the host cells , the outcome of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection , whether there are cy ##top ##athic effects or not , depends on the cell types that are infected . at the whole ‐ body level , immune ‐ mediated damage , due to activation of cy ##tok ##ines and / or che ##mo ##kin ##es and , perhaps , auto ##im ##mun ##ity , may play key roles in the clinical and path ##ological features of sar ##s . continued research is still required to determine the pathogen ##etic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease . copyright © 2006 path ##ological society of great britain and ireland . published by john wiley & sons , ltd .  
recently we have described the discovery and complete genome sequence of a novel corona ##virus associated with pneumonia , corona ##virus hk ##u ##1 ( co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 ) . in this study , a detailed in si ##lic ##o analysis of the or ##f ##1 ##ab , encoding the 7 , 182 ‐ amino acid replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein in the co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 genome showed that the replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein of co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 is cl ##ea ##ved by its papa ##in ‐ like pro ##tea ##ses and 3 ##c ‐ like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) into 16 poly ##pe ##pt ##ides homo ##log ##ous to the corresponding poly ##pe ##pt ##ides in other corona ##virus ##es . surprisingly , analysis of the put ##ative cleavage sites of the 3 ##cl ( pro ) revealed a unique put ##ative cleavage site . in all known corona ##virus ##es , the p ##1 positions at the cleavage sites of the 3 ##cl ( pro ) are occupied by g ##lu ##tam ##ine . this is also observed in co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 , except for one site at the junction between ns ##p ##10 ( he ##lica ##se ) and ns ##p ##11 ( member of ex ##on ##uc ##lea ##se family ) , where the p ##1 position is occupied by his ##ti ##dine . this amino acid substitution is due to a single nu ##cle ##otide mutation in the co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 genome , ca ##g / a to cat . this probably represents a novel cleavage site because the same mutation was consistently observed in co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 sequences from multiple specimens of different patients ; the p ##2 and p ##1 ′ ‐ p ##12 ′ positions of this cleavage site are consistent between co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 and other corona ##virus ##es ; and as the he ##lica ##se is one of the most conserved proteins in corona ##virus ##es , cleavage between ns ##p ##10 and ns ##p ##11 should be an essential step for the generation of the mature functional he ##lica ##se . experiments , including purification and c ‐ terminal amino acid sequencing of the co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 he ##lica ##se and trans ‐ cleavage ass ##ays of the co ##v ‐ hk ##u ##1 3 ##cl ( pro ) will confirm the presence of this novel cleavage site .  
sar ##s ‐ co ##v grows in a variety of tissues that express its receptor , although the mechanism for high replication in the lungs and severe respiratory illness is not well understood . we recently showed that el ##ast ##ase enhance ##s sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection in culture ##d cells , which suggests that sar ##s development may be due to el ##ast ##ase ‐ mediated , enhanced sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection in the lungs . to explore this possibility , we examined whether co ‐ infection of mice with sar ##s ‐ co ##v and pp , a low ‐ pathogen ##ic bacterium which eli ##cit ##s el ##ast ##ase production in the lungs , induce ##s ex ##ace ##rba ##tion of pneumonia . mice co ‐ infected with sar ##s ‐ co ##v and pp developed severe respiratory disease with extensive weight loss , resulting in a [UNK] % mortality rate . mice with ex ##ace ##rba ##ted pneumonia showed enhanced virus infection in the lungs and his ##top ##ath ##ological lesions similar to those found in human sar ##s cases . intra ##nas ##al administration of lp ##s , another el ##ast ##ase induce ##r , showed an effect similar to that of pp infection . thus , this study shows that ex ##ace ##rba ##ted pneumonia in mice results from co ‐ infection with sar ##s ‐ co ##v and a respiratory bacterium that induce ##s el ##ast ##ase production in the lungs , suggesting a possible role for el ##ast ##ase in the ex ##ace ##rba ##tion of pneumonia .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a single ‐ stranded rna virus that causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a high fatal ##ity rate . binding of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 is the critical step in mer ##s ‐ co ##v infection of a host cell . no vaccines or clinical ##ly applicable treatments are currently available for mer ##s ‐ co ##v . therefore , rapid diagnosis is important for improving patient outcomes through prompt treatment and protection against viral outbreak ##s . in this study , the aim was to establish two elisa systems for detecting antigen ##s and antibodies against mer ##s ‐ co ##v . using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt full ‐ length s protein , an indirect elisa was developed and found to detect mer ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ specific antibodies in animal sera and sera of patient with mer ##s . moreover , mab ##s were induced with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt s protein and rb ##d and used for sandwich elisa to detect the mer ##s ‐ co ##v s protein . neither elisa system exhibited significant intra ‐ ass ##ay or inter ‐ ass ##ay variation , indicating good rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility . moreover , the inter ‐ day precision and sensitivity were adequate for use as a diagnostic kit . thus , these elisa ##s can be used clinical ##ly to dia ##gno ##se mer ##s ‐ co ##v .  
we evaluated the efficacy of three sar ##s vaccine candidates in a mu ##rine sar ##s model utilizing low ‐ vi ##ru ##lence pp and sar ##s ‐ co ##v coin ##fect ##ion . va ##cci ##nated mice were protected from severe respiratory disease in parallel with a low virus ti ##ter in the lungs and a high neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ter in the plasma . importantly , the administration of spike protein ‐ specific neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody protected mice from the disease , indicating that the neutral ##ization is sufficient for protection . moreover , a high level of il ‐ 6 and mc ##p ‐ 1 production , but not other 18 cy ##tok ##ines tested , on days 2 and 3 after sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection was closely linked to the virus replication and disease severity , suggesting the importance of these cy ##tok ##ines in the lung pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection .  
a novel human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) has been identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in 2003 . the spike ( s ) protein of this virus is a type i surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that media ##tes binding of the virus to the host receptor and the subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes . because of its critical role in viral entry , the s protein is an important target for the development of anti ‐ sar ##s co ##v therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s . this article reviews the structure and function of the sar ##s co ##v s protein in the context of its role in virus entry . topics that are discussed include : the interaction between the s ##1 domain of the sar ##s spike protein and the cellular receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , and the structural features of the ec ##to ##dom ##ain of ace ##2 ; the antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts presented by the s protein and the nature of neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that are eli ##cite ##d in vivo ; the structure of the 4 , 3 ‐ hydro ##phobic he ##pta ##d repeats hr ##1 and hr ##2 of the s ##2 domain and their interaction to form a six ‐ he ##lica ##l bundle during the final stages of fusion . opportunities for the design and development of anti ‐ sar ##s agents based on the inhibition of receptor binding , the therapeutic uses of s ‐ directed mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and inhibitors of hr ##1 – hr ##2 complex formation are presented . © 2006 wiley periodicals , inc . med res rev , 26 , no . 4 , 41 ##4 – 43 ##3 , 2006 
sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hoe ##a syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s ‐ co ##v ) , a novel corona ##virus , was first discovered in southern china in january 2017 and caused a large scale outbreak of fatal dia ##rr ##hea ##l disease in pig ##lets . here , we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 sw ##ine farms with a clinical history of dia ##rr ##hea ##l disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of sad ##s ‐ co ##v in pigs in china . our results suggest that sad ##s ‐ co ##v has emerged in china at least since august 2016 . meanwhile , we detected a prevalence of sad ##s ‐ co ##v ( 43 . 53 % ) , por ##cine delta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( 8 . 83 % ) , por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hoe ##a virus ( pe ##d ##v ) ( 78 . 25 % ) , rot ##avi ##rus ( 21 . 77 % ) , and trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus ( 0 % ) , and we also found the co ‐ infection of sad ##s ‐ co ##v and pe ##d ##v occurred most frequently with the rate of 17 . 65 % . we screened and obtained two new complete genome ##s , five n and five s genes of sad ##s ‐ co ##v . phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences revealed that all sad ##s ‐ co ##v sequences in this study clustered with previously reported sad ##s ‐ co ##v strains to form a well defined branch that grouped with the bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##2 strains . this study is the first retrospective investigation for sad ##s ‐ co ##v and provides the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information of this new virus in china , which highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control sad ##s ‐ co ##v .  
a new highly vi ##ru ##lent sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hoe ##a syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s ‐ co ##v ) emerged in guangdong province in 2017 followed by fatal dia ##rr ##hoe ##a that involved the death of 24 , 69 ##3 pig ##lets . and yet from may 2017 to january 2019 , there were no new sad ##s cases arising in pig herds in guangdong . in this study , we reported the recent dia ##rr ##hoe ##a outbreak of sad ##s ‐ co ##v in southern china on february 2019 . int ##estinal samples collected from dia ##rr ##hoe ##al pig ##lets were detected for common sw ##ine virus and confirmed that sad ##s ‐ co ##v was responsible for the dia ##rr ##hoe ##a case . meanwhile , ser ##ological investigation of so ##ws ’ sera implied that sad ##s ‐ co ##v has existed in the farm and pe ##d ##v antibody may not directly contribute to the amp ##li ##fication of sad ##s ‐ co ##v . homo ##logy and phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed that the re ‐ emerging sad ##s ‐ co ##v strain shared high sequence identities with existing sad ##s ‐ co ##v strains and all strains clustered together in alpha corona ##virus . all in all , the report here ##in emphasized the re ‐ emerging of sad ##s ‐ co ##v and highlights continuous monitoring for this virus .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus , called the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . over 95 % of well characterized co ##hort ##s of sar ##s have evidence of recent sar ##s ‐ co ##v infection . the genome of sar ##s ‐ co ##v has been sequence ##d and it is not related to any of the previously known human or animal corona ##virus ##es . it is probable that sar ##s ‐ co ##v was an animal virus that adapted to human ‐ human transmission in the recent past . the virus can be found in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate , urine and stool ##s of sar ##s patients . second generation reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ays are able to detect sar ##s ‐ co ##v in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates of approximately 80 % of patients with sar ##s within the first 3 days of illness . ser ##oco ##n ##version for sar ##s ‐ co ##v using im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence on infected cells is an excellent method of confirming the diagnosis , but antibody responses only appear around day 10 of the illness . within the first 10 days the his ##to ##logical picture is that of acute phase diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage ( dad ) with a mixture of inflammatory infiltrate , o ##ede ##ma and h ##yal ##ine membrane formation . des ##qua ##mation of p ##ne ##um ##ocytes is prominent and consistent . after 10 days of illness the picture changes to one of organizing dad with increased fi ##bro ##sis , sq ##ua ##mous meta ##pl ##asia and multi ##nu ##cle ##ated giant cells . the role of cy ##tok ##ines in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s is still unclear .  
nos ##oco ##mia ##l cluster ##ing with transmission to health care workers , patients and visitors is a prominent feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . hospital outbreak ##s of sar ##s typically occurred within the first week after admission of the very first sar ##s cases when the disease was not recognized and before isolation measures were implemented . in the majority of nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections , there was a history of close contact with a sar ##s patient , and transmission occurred via large droplets , direct contact with infectious material or by contact with f ##omi ##tes contaminated by infectious material . in a few instances , potential airborne transmission was reported in association with end ##ot ##rac ##hea ##l int ##uba ##tion , ne ##bu ##lis ##ed medications and non ‐ invasive positive pressure ventilation of sar ##s patients . in all sar ##s ‐ affected countries , nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of the disease was effectively halted by enforcement of routine standard , contact and drop ##let precautions in all clinical areas and additional airborne precautions in the high ‐ risk areas . in hong kong , where there are few private rooms for patient isolation , some hospitals have obtained good outcome by having designated sar ##s teams and separate wards for patient tri ##age , confirmed sar ##s cases and step ‐ down of patients in whom sar ##s had been ruled out . in conclusion , sar ##s represents one of the new challenges for those who are involved in hospital infection control . as sar ##s might re ‐ emerge , all hospitals should take advantage of the current sar ##s ‐ free interval to review their infection control programmes , alert mechanisms , response capability and to repair any identified ina ##de ##qua ##cies .  
sar ##s ‐ co ##v is a new type of human corona ##virus identified as a ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . on the occasion of the sar ##s outbreak , various mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against sar ##s ‐ co ##v have been developed and applied for diagnosis , clinical management and basic research . in this review , we overview the bio ##chemical and functional properties and applications of these sar ##s ‐ co ##v mab ##s . we also focus on a variety of vaccines currently under development and discuss the immune response eli ##cite ##d by these vaccines in animal models , hopefully to better understand what we need to do next to fight against newly emerging pathogen ##s in the future . copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons , ltd .  
in past decades , we have seen several epidemic ##s of respiratory infections from newly emerging viruses , most of which originated in animals . these emerging infections , including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) and the pan ##de ##mic influenza a ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ) and av ##ian influenza ( ai ) viruses , have seriously threatened global health and the economy . in particular , mer ##s ‐ co ##v and ai a ( h ##7 ##n ##9 ) are still causing infections in several areas , and some cluster ##ing of cases of a ( h ##5 ##n ##1 ) and a ( h ##7 ##n ##9 ) may imply future possible pan ##de ##mics . additionally , given the inappropriate use of antibiotics and international travel , the spread of car ##ba ##pen ##em ‐ resistant gram ‐ negative bacteria is also a significant concern . these infections with epidemic or pan ##de ##mic potential present a persistent threat to public health and a huge burden on healthcare services in the asia ‐ pacific region . therefore , to enable efficient infection prevention and control , more effective international surveillance and collaboration systems , in the context of the ‘ one health ’ approach , are necessary .  
in order to develop a dose ‐ response model for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) , the poole ##d data sets for infection of trans ##genic mice susceptible to sar ##s ‐ co ##v and infection of mice with mu ##rine hepatitis virus strain 1 , which may be a clinical ##ly relevant model of sar ##s , were fit to beta ‐ po ##isson and exponential models with the maximum likelihood method . the exponential model ( k = 4 . 1 × l ##0 ( 2 ) ) could describe the dose ‐ response relationship of the poole ##d data sets . the beta ‐ po ##isson model did not provide a statistical ##ly significant improvement in fit . with the exponential model , the in ##fect ##ivity of sar ##s ‐ co ##v was calculated and compared with those of other corona ##virus ##es . the does of sar ##s ‐ co ##v corresponding to 10 % and 50 % responses ( illness ) were estimated at 43 and 280 p ##fu , respectively . its estimated in ##fect ##ivity was comparable to that of hc ##ov ‐ 229 ##e , known as an agent of human common cold , and also similar to those of some animal corona ##virus ##es belonging to the same genetic group . moreover , the exponential model was applied to the analysis of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data of sar ##s outbreak that occurred at an apartment complex in hong kong in 2003 . the estimated dose of sar ##s ‐ co ##v for apartment residents during the outbreak , which was back ‐ calculated from the reported number of cases , ranged from 16 to 160 p ##fu / person , depending on the floor . the exponential model developed here is the sole dose ‐ response model for sar ##s ‐ co ##v at the present and would enable us to understand the possibility for re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of sar ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is caused by a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus that was isolated in late 2012 in saudi arabia . the viral infections have been reported in more than 1700 humans , ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild cases to severe pneumonia with a mortality rate of 40 % . it is well documented now that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s contract the infection and shed the virus without notable symptoms , and such animals had been infected by at least the early 1980s . the mechanism of camel to human transmission is still not clear , but several primary cases have been associated with camel contact . there is no approved anti ##vira ##l drug or vaccine against mer ##s ‐ co ##v despite the active research in this area . vaccine candidates have been developed using various platforms and regime ##ns and have been tested in several animal models . here , this article reviews the published studies on mer ##s ‐ co ##v vaccines with more focus on vaccines tested in large animals , including camel ##s . it is fore ##see ##able that the 1 ‐ health approach could be the best way of tack ##ling the mer ##s ‐ co ##v endemic in the arabian peninsula , by using the mass va ##cci ##nation of camel ##s in the affected areas to block camel to human transmission . camel vaccines can be developed in a faster time with fewer regulations and lower costs and could clear this virus from the arabian peninsula if accompanied by efficient public health measures .  
background and objectives various measures to ina ##ct ##ivate / remove viruses have been implemented for manufacturing plasma ‐ derived products . here , we examined the heat ina ##ct ##ivation ability of an agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . materials and methods the frankfurt ‐ 1 strain of sar ##s ‐ co ##v was incorporated in manufacturing processes of several products by using samples collected immediately before liquid heat treatment at 60 °c . results sar ##s ‐ co ##v was easily inactivated by this treatment for 60 min in all in ‐ process samples . however , the different composition of the tested samples affected the heat sensitivity of the virus strain : the in ##fect ##ivity of the virus in anti ##th ##rom ##bin iii preparation still remained after heating for 30 min at 60 °c . conclusion if by rare chance sar ##s ‐ co ##v con ##tam ##inates source plasma , there should be no or only minor risk of this virus infection , due to sufficient ina ##ct ##ivation by the 60 °c 10 h liquid heating step , although we must pay attention to the composition used for blood product preparation .  
the recent identification of a novel clinical entity , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the rapid subsequent spread and case fatal ##ity rates of 14 – 15 % have prompted a massive international collaborative investigation facilitated by a network of laboratories established by the world health organization ( who ) . as sar ##s has the potential of becoming the first pan ##de ##mic of the new millennium , a global warning by the who was issued on 12 march 2003 . the disease , which is believed to have its origin in the chinese guangdong province , spread from hong kong via international airports to its current worldwide distribution . the concert ##ed efforts of a globally united scientific community have led to the independent isolation and identification of a novel corona ##virus from sar ##s patients by several groups . the extra ##ord ##ina ##rily rapid isolation of a ca ##usa ##tive agent of this newly emerged infectious disease constitutes an unprecedented scientific achievement . the main scope of the article is to provide the clinic ##ian with an overview of the natural history , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical characteristics of sar ##s . on the basis of the recently published viral genome and structural features common to the members of the corona ##virus family , a model for host cell – virus interaction and possible targets for anti ##vira ##l drugs are presented . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological consequences of introducing a novel pathogen in a previously une ##x ##posed population and the origin and evolution of a new and more pathogen ##ic strain of corona ##virus are discussed .  
pulmonary sp ‐ d is a defence le ##ct ##in promoting clearance of viral infections . sp ‐ d is recognized to bind the s protein of sar ##s ‐ co ##v and enhance ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis . moreover , systemic sp ‐ d is widely used as a bio ##mark ##er of al ##ve ##olar integrity . we investigated the relation between plasma sp ‐ d , sar ##s ‐ type pneumonia and the sar ##s ‐ specific i ##gg response . sixteen patients with sar ##s , 19 patients with community ‐ acquired pneumonia ( cap ) ( st ##re ##pt ##oco ##ccus pneumonia ) and 16 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study . plasma sp ‐ d and anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein i ##gg were measured using elisa . sp ‐ d was significantly elevated in sar ##s ‐ type pneumonia [ median ( 95 % ci ) , 45 ##3 ( 37 ##9 – 96 ##3 ) ng / ml versus controls 218 ( 160 – 36 ##2 ) ng / ml , p < 0 . 05 ] like in patients with cap . sp ‐ d significantly correlated with anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein i ##gg ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 59 ##9 ##5 , p = 0 . 02 ) . the possible re ‐ emergence of sar ##s or sar ##s ‐ like infections suggests a need for minimal traumatic techniques for following the al ##ve ##olar compartment , e . g . during testing of anti ##vira ##ls . we suggest that monitoring systemic sp ‐ d may be useful in monitoring the al ##ve ##olar integrity in sar ##s ‐ type pneumonia . the significant correlation between plasma sp ‐ d and anti ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ specific antibodies support the role for sp ‐ d in inter ##link ##ing innate and adaptive immune pathways .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome ‐ corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a novel zoo ##not ##ic pathogen . although the potential for mer ##s ‐ co ##v transmission through blood trans ##fusion is not clear , mer ##s ‐ co ##v was recognized as a pathogen of concern for the safety of the blood supply especially after its detection in whole blood , serum , and plasma of infected individuals . here we investigated the efficacy of am ##oto ##sal ##en and ultraviolet a light ( uv ##a ) to ina ##ct ##ivate mer ##s ‐ co ##v in fresh ‐ frozen plasma ( ff ##p ) . study design and methods : poole ##d ff ##p units were spiked with a recent clinical mer ##s ‐ co ##v isolate . infectious and gen ##omic viral ti ##ters were determined in plasma before and after ina ##ct ##ivation with am ##oto ##sal ##en / uv ##a treatment by plaque ass ##ay and reverse transcription – quantitative polymer ##ase chain reaction , respectively . in addition , residual replica ##ting or live virus after ina ##ct ##ivation was examined by pass ##aging in the per ##missive ve ##ro e ##6 cells . results : the mean mer ##s ‐ co ##v infectious ti ##ter in pre ##tre ##at ##ment samples was 4 . 67 ± 0 . 25 log plaque ‐ forming units ( p ##fu ) / ml , which was reduced to und ##ete ##ctable levels after ina ##ct ##ivation with am ##oto ##sal ##en / uv ##a demonstrating a mean log reduction of more than 4 . 67 ± 0 . 25 p ##fu / ml . furthermore , in ##oc ##ulation of inactivated plasma on ve ##ro e ##6 cells did not result in any cy ##top ##athic effect ( cp ##e ) even after 7 days of inc ##uba ##tion and three consecutive passages , nor the detection of mer ##s rna compared to pre ##tre ##at ##ment samples which showed complete cp ##e within 2 to 3 days post ##ino ##cula ##tion and log viral rna ti ##ter ranging from 9 . 48 to 10 . 22 copies / ml in all three passages . conclusion : our data show that am ##oto ##sal ##en / uv ##a treatment is a potent and effective way to ina ##ct ##ivate mer ##s ‐ co ##v infectious particles in ff ##p to und ##ete ##ctable levels and to minimize the risk of any possible trans ##fusion ‐ related mer ##s ‐ co ##v transmission .  
background : e ##bola virus ( e ##bo ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) have been identified as potential threats to blood safety . this study investigated the efficacy of the the ##raf ##le ##x uv ‐ plate ##lets and the ##raf ##le ##x mb ‐ plasma pathogen ina ##ct ##ivation systems to ina ##ct ##ivate e ##bo ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v in plate ##let concentrate ##s ( pcs ) and plasma , respectively . study design and methods : pcs and plasma were spiked with high ti ##ters of cell culture – derived e ##bo ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v , treated with various light doses of ultraviolet c ( uv ##c ; the ##raf ##le ##x uv ‐ plate ##lets ) or methyl ##ene blue ( mb ) plus visible light ( mb / light ; the ##raf ##le ##x mb ‐ plasma ) , and assessed for residual viral in ##fect ##ivity . results : uv ##c reduced e ##bo ##v ( ≥ ##4 . 5 log ) and mer ##s ‐ co ##v ( ≥ ##3 . 7 log ) in ##fect ##ivity in pcs to the limit of detection , and mb / light decreased e ##bo ##v ( ≥ ##4 . 6 log ) and mer ##s ‐ co ##v ( ≥ ##3 . 3 log ) ti ##ters in plasma to non ##de ##tec ##table levels . conclusions : both the ##raf ##le ##x uv ‐ plate ##lets ( uv ##c ) and the ##raf ##le ##x mb ‐ plasma ( mb / light ) effectively reduce e ##bo ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v in ##fect ##ivity in plate ##lets and plasma , respectively .  
objective : this study aimed to assess the efficacy of the intercept ##™ blood system [ am ##oto ##sal ##en / ultraviolet a ( uv ##a ) light ] to reduce the risk of middle east respiratory syndrome ‐ corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) transmission by human plate ##let concentrate ##s . background : since 2012 , more than 242 ##5 mer ##s ‐ co ##v human cases have been reported in 27 countries . the infection causes acute respiratory disease , which was responsible for 83 ##8 deaths in these countries , mainly in saudi arabia . viral gen ##omic rna was detected in whole blood , serum and plasma of infected patients , raising concerns of the safety of blood supplies , especially in endemic areas . methods : four ap ##her ##esis plate ##let units in 100 % plasma were in ##oc ##ulated with a clinical mer ##s ‐ co ##v isolate . spiked units were then treated with am ##oto ##sal ##en / uv ##a to ina ##ct ##ivate mer ##s ‐ co ##v . infectious and gen ##omic viral ti ##tres were quan ##ti ##fied by plaque ass ##ay and quantitative real ‐ time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt ‐ q ##pc ##r ) . inactivated samples were successively passage ##d th ##rice on ve ##ro e ##6 cells to exclude the presence of residual replication ‐ competent viral particles in inactivated plate ##lets . results : complete ina ##ct ##ivation of mer ##s ‐ co ##v in spiked plate ##let units was achieved by treatment with am ##oto ##sal ##en / uv ##a light with a mean log reduction of 4 · 48 ± 0 · 3 . pass ##aging of the inactivated samples in ve ##ro e ##6 showed no viral replication even after nine days of inc ##uba ##tion and three passages . viral gen ##omic rna ti ##tra ##tion in inactivated samples showed ti ##tres comparable to those in pre ‐ treatment samples . conclusion : am ##oto ##sal ##en and uv ##a light treatment of mer ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ spiked plate ##let concentrate ##s efficiently and completely inactivated mer ##s ‐ co ##v in ##fect ##ivity ( > 4 logs ) , suggesting that such treatment could mini ##mise the risk of trans ##fusion ‐ related mer ##s ‐ co ##v transmission .  
abstract : in order to determine highly im ##mun ##ogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) ep ##ito ##pe peptide ##s capable of inducing long ‐ lasting immunity , we first screened im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ‐ g ( i ##gg ) antibodies reactive to 197 different overlapping 15 ‐ mer ##s from the sar ##s ‐ co ##v proteins in the sera of three infected patients . forty ‐ two peptide ##s among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients . consequently , we tested for the react ##ivity of these 42 peptide ##s to patients ' sera ( n = 45 ) at 6 ‐ month post ‐ infection . the significantly higher levels of i ##gg antibodies specific to three ( s ##7 ##9 ##1 , m2 ##0 ##7 and n ##16 ##1 ) of 42 peptide ##s were detect ##able in the post ‐ infection sera from 23 ( 51 % ) , 27 ( 60 % ) and 19 ( 42 % ) of 45 patients , respectively . these three peptide ##s , recognized by their long ‐ lasting immunity , may provide a better understanding of the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of sar ##s ‐ co ##v .  
dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the main reservoir of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , but other livestock species ( i . e . , al ##pac ##as , ll ##ama ##s , and pigs ) are also susceptible to infection with mer ##s ‐ co ##v . animal ‐ to ‐ animal transmission in al ##pac ##as was reported , but evidence for transmission in other species has not been proved . this study explored pig ‐ to ‐ pig mer ##s ‐ co ##v transmission experimental ##ly . virus was present in nasal sw ##ab ##s of infected animals , and limited amounts of viral rna , but no infectious virus were detected in the direct contact pigs . no virus was detected in the indirect contact group . furthermore , direct and indirect contact pigs did not develop specific antibodies against mer ##s ‐ co ##v . therefore , the role of pigs as reservoir is probably ne ##gli ##gible , although it deserves further confirmation .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) has been identified as a potential threat to the safety of blood products . the mira ##sol pathogen reduction technology system uses rib ##of ##lav ##in and ultraviolet ( uv ) light to render blood ‐ borne pathogen ##s non ##in ##fect ##ious while maintaining blood product quality . here , we report on the efficacy of rib ##of ##lav ##in and uv light against mer ##s ‐ co ##v when tested in human plasma . study design and methods : mer ##s ‐ co ##v ( em ##c strain ) was used to in ##oc ##ulate plasma units that then underwent treatment with rib ##of ##lav ##in and uv light . the infectious ti ##ters of mer ##s ‐ co ##v in the samples before and after treatment were determined by plaque ass ##ay on ve ##ro cells . the treatments were initially performed in trip ##lica ##te using poole ##d plasma ( n = 3 ) and then repeated using individual plasma units ( n = 6 ) . results : in both studies , rib ##of ##lav ##in and uv light reduced the infectious ti ##ter of mer ##s ‐ co ##v below the limit of detection . the mean log reductions in the viral ti ##ters were ≥ ##4 . 07 and ≥ ##4 . 42 for the poole ##d and individual donor plasma , respectively . conclusion : rib ##of ##lav ##in and uv light effectively reduced the ti ##ter of mer ##s ‐ co ##v in human plasma products to below the limit of detection , suggesting that the treatment process may reduce the risk of trans ##fusion transmission of mer ##s ‐ co ##v .  
bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs of several zoo ##not ##ic viruses , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , ni ##pa ##h virus and hen ##dra virus . in this study , consensus prime ##r ‐ based reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reactions ( rt ‐ pc ##rs ) and high ‐ through ##put sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat fae ##cal samples collected at 11 natural bat habitat sites from july to december 2015 in korea . diverse corona ##virus ##es were first detected in korean bat fae ##ces , including alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ like and mer ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ like beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . in addition , we identified a novel bat rot ##avi ##rus belonging to group h rot ##avi ##rus which has only been described in human and pigs until now . therefore , our results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional vi ##rol ##ogical studies in domestic bat .  
objectives to describe the spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al diffusion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic in mainland china , and to anal ##yse the spatial pattern of sar ##s transmission from the beijing epic ##ent ##re to its neighbouring areas . methods probable sar ##s cases occurring between november 2002 and may 2003 in mainland china were compiled from different sources and geo ‐ coded into a geographical information database based on onset location . spatial analyses including kernel density estimation , and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to character ##ise the spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al distribution of sar ##s cases based on onset location / date . sar ##s cases that got infected in beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding beijing were mapped , and log ##istic regression using a ‘ case – control ’ design at the county level was performed to anal ##yse the impact of travel ‐ related risk factors in the diffusion pattern . results the sar ##s epidemic in mainland china spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas : first in guangdong province , and about 3 months later in beijing with its surrounding areas in shan ##xi province , inner mongolia auto ##no ##mic region , he ##bei province and tianjin . counties in the neighbourhood of beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter ‐ provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring sar ##s infections , even after correction for population density and medical staff density . being intersect ##ed by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of sar ##s . conclusions this study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the sar ##s epidemic in mainland china . our analyses confirmed that sar ##s had benefited from national highways and inter ‐ provincial freeway ##s for its spread from epic ##ent ##res to neighbouring areas , whereas trains showed no significant association . this knowledge may be important for the control of re ‐ emerging sar ##s , or other future emerging human ‐ to ‐ human transmit ##table infections .  
summary . a novel human corona ##virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in epidemic form in early 2003 in china and spread worldwide in a few months . every newly emerging human pathogen is of concern for the safety of the blood supply during and after an epidemic crisis . for this purpose , we have evaluated the ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s ‐ corona ##virus ( co ##v ) in plate ##let concentrate ##s using an approved pathogen ina ##ct ##ivation device , the intercept blood system . ap ##her ##esis plate ##let concentrate ##s ( ap ##cs ) were in ##oc ##ulated with approximately 10 ( 6 ) p ##fu ml ( − ##1 ) of either urban ##i or hs ##r ##1 isolate ##s of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the in ##oc ##ulated units were mixed with 150 µ ##m am ##oto ##sal ##en and illuminated with 3 j cm ( − ##2 ) uv ‐ a light . the viral ti ##tres were determined by plaque formation in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . mixing sar ##s ‐ co ##v with ap ##c in the absence of any treatment decreased viral in ##fect ##ivity by approximately 0 · 5 – 1 log ( 10 ) . following photo ##chemical treatment , sar ##s ‐ co ##v was consistently inactivated to the limit of detection in seven independent ap ##c units . no infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one ‐ third of the ap ##c unit was ass ##ay ##ed , demonstrating a mean log ( 10 ) ‐ reduction of > 6 · 2 . potent ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s ‐ co ##v therefore extends the capability of the intercept blood system in ina ##ct ##ivating a broad spectrum of human pathogen ##s including recently emerging respiratory viruses .  
corona ##virus ( co ##vid - 19 ) is an enveloped rna virus that is diverse ##ly found in humans and wildlife . a total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans . they are known to in ##fect the neurological , respiratory , enter ##ic , and he ##pati ##c systems . the past few decades have seen endemic outbreak ##s in the form of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . yet again , we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . the most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown et ##iology in a cluster of patients in wu ##han , china . the epic ##enter of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is highly con ##tag ##ious and has resulted in a rapid pan ##de ##mic of co ##vid - 19 . as the number of cases continues to rise , it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health . this review will introduce a general overview of corona ##virus and describe the clinical features , evaluation , and treatment of co ##vid - 19 patients . it will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pan ##de ##mic . furthermore , our review focuses on the most up - to - date clinical information for the effective management , prevention , and counseling of patients worldwide .  
corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission . since the first case appeared in wu ##han , china , in december 2019 , the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide . up to now , according to official data released by the chinese health commission , the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining , and the epidemic is gradually being controlled . although most patients have mild symptoms and good pro ##gno ##sis after infection , some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications . the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in humans remains unclear . immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogen ##s and there is currently no specific anti ##vira ##l drug against the virus . this article reviews the im ##mun ##ological changes of corona ##virus ##es like sar ##s , mer ##s and other viral pneumonia similar to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . combined with the published literature , the potential pathogen ##esis of co ##vid - 19 is in ##fer ##red , and the treatment recommendations for giving high - doses intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin and low - molecular - weight he ##par ##in anti ##co ##ag ##ula ##nt therapy to severe type patients are proposed .  
diagnostic testing to identify persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome – related corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s – co ##v - 2 ) infection is central to control the global pan ##de ##mic of co ##vid - 19 that began in late 2019 . in a few countries , the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies . in contrast , the united states , hampered by limited testing capacity , has prior ##iti ##zed testing for specific groups of persons . real - time reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction – based ass ##ays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for co ##vid - 19 diagnostic ##s . however , point - of - care technologies and ser ##olo ##gic im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys are rapidly emerging . although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic patients in well - equipped laboratories , important gaps remain in screening as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic persons in the inc ##uba ##tion phase , as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shed ##ding during con ##vale ##sc ##ence to inform decisions to end isolation . many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibit ##ed rapid increases in testing capacity . these challenges may be even greater in low - resource settings . urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for sar ##s – co ##v - 2 infection . here , the authors review the current array of tests for sar ##s – co ##v - 2 , highlight gaps in current diagnostic capacity , and propose potential solutions .  
a cluster of severe pneumonia of unknown et ##iology in wu ##han city , hub ##ei province in china emerged in december 2019 . a novel corona ##virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was isolated from lower respiratory tract sample as the ca ##usa ##tive agent . the current outbreak of infections with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is termed corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . co ##vid - 19 rapidly spread into at least 114 countries and killed more than 4 , 000 people by march 11 2020 . who officially declared co ##vid - 19 a pan ##de ##mic on march 11 , 2020 . there have been 2 novel corona ##virus outbreak ##s in the past 2 decades . the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 – 2003 caused by sar ##s - co ##v had a case fatal ##ity rate of around 10 % ( 8 , 09 ##8 confirmed cases and 77 ##4 deaths ) , while middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by mer ##s - co ##v killed 86 ##1 people out of a total 2 , 50 ##2 confirmed cases between 2012 and 2019 . the purpose of this review is to sum ##mar ##ize known - to - date information about sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and clinical features .  
in the past two decades , several newly emerging and re ##eme ##rg ##ing viral respiratory pathogen ##s including several influenza viruses ( av ##ian influenza and pan ##de ##mic influenza ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , have continued to challenge medical and public health systems . thereafter , the development of cost - effective , broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l agents is the urgent mission of both vi ##rol ##ogist ##s and ph ##arm ##aco ##logists . current anti ##vira ##l developments have focused targets on viral entry , replication , release , and inter ##cellular pathways essential for viral life cycle . here , we review the current literature on challenges and prospects in the development of these anti ##vira ##ls .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are enveloped rna viruses that in ##fect birds , mammals , and humans . infections caused by human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) are mostly associated with the respiratory , enter ##ic , and nervous systems . the hc ##ov ##s only occasionally induce lower respiratory tract disease , including bro ##nch ##itis , bro ##nch ##iol ##itis , and pneumonia . in 2002 to 2003 , a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was the seminal detection of a novel co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . a decade later ( june 2012 ) , another novel co ##v was implicated as the cause of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in saudi arabia . although bats might serve as a reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v , it is unlikely that they are the direct source for most human cases . severe lines of evidence suggest that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been the major cause of transmission to humans . the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v has triggered serious concerns about the potential for a widespread outbreak . all mer ##s cases were linked directly or indirectly to the middle east region including saudi arabia , jordan , qatar , oman , kuwait , and uae . mer ##s cases have also been reported in the later phases in the united kingdom , france , germany , italy , spain , and tunisia . most of these mer ##s cases were linked with the middle east . the high mortality rates in family - based and hospital - based outbreak ##s were reported among patients with como ##rb ##idi ##ties such as diabetes and renal failure . mer ##s - co ##v causes an acute , highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction . the major complications reported in fatal cases are hyper ##kal ##emia with associated vent ##ric ##ular ta ##chy ##card ##ia , di ##sse ##minated intra ##vas ##cular coa ##gul ##ation , per ##ica ##rdi ##tis , and multi ##org ##an failure . the case - fatal ##ity rate seems to be higher for mer ##s - co ##v ( around 30 % ) than for sar ##s - co ##v ( 9 . 6 % ) . the combination regime ##n of type 1 inter ##fer ##on + lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r is considered as the first - line therapy for mer ##s . anti ##vira ##l treatment is generally recommended for 10 to 14 days in patients with mer ##s - co ##v infection . con ##vale ##scent plasma therapy has shown some efficacy among patients ref ##rac ##tory to anti ##vira ##l drugs if administered within 2 weeks of the onset of the disease .  
in december 2019 , cases of pneumonia of unknown cause first started to appear in wu ##han in china ; subsequently , a new corona ##virus was soon identified as the cause of the illness , now known as corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . since then , infections have been confirmed worldwide in numerous countries , with the number of cases steadily rising . the aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and , in particular , to de ##du ##ce from it potential risks and complications for pregnant patients . for this purpose , the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the sar ##s epidemic of 2002 / 2003 , the mer ##s ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) epidemic ongoing since 2012 , as well as recent publications on cases infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported . based on the literature available at the moment , it can be assumed that the clinical course of co ##vid - 19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate . it may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in ut ##ero is unlikely . breast ##fe ##eding is possible once infection has been excluded or the disease declared cured .  
in late 2019 , a queer type of pneumonia emerged in wu ##han city in the central part of china . on investigation , it was found to be caused by the corona ##virus . human corona ##virus ##es were discovered in the 1960s . there are a total of seven types of corona ##virus ##es that in ##fect humans : 229 ##e and nl ##6 ##3 are the alpha corona ##virus ##es ; o ##c ##43 , hk ##u ##1 , mer ##s - co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v are beta corona ##virus ##es , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or co ##vid - 19 is a novel corona ##virus . co ##vid - 19 surfaced in china at the cu ##lm ##ination of the year 2019 . the pan ##de ##mic then fan ##ned out rapidly , involving italy , japan , south korea , iran , and the rest of the world .  
background : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a rna corona ##virus responsible for the pan ##de ##mic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( co ##vid - 19 ) . rna viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate , up to a million times higher than that of their hosts . virus mu ##tage ##nic capability depends upon several factors , including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nuclei ##c acids , as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) . mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability , thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance . methods : we analyzed 220 gen ##omic sequences from the gi ##sai ##d database derived from patients infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 worldwide from december 2019 to mid - march 2020 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reference genome was obtained from the gen ##bank database . genome ##s alignment was performed using cl ##ust ##al omega . mann – whitney and fisher - exact tests were used to assess statistical significance . results : we characterized 8 novel rec ##urrent mutations of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , located at positions 139 ##7 , 289 ##1 , 144 ##0 ##8 , 1774 ##6 , 1785 ##7 , 1806 ##0 , 234 ##0 ##3 and 288 ##8 ##1 . mutations in 289 ##1 , 303 ##6 , 144 ##0 ##8 , 234 ##0 ##3 and 288 ##8 ##1 positions are predominantly observed in europe , whereas those located at positions 1774 ##6 , 1785 ##7 and 1806 ##0 are exclusively present in north america . we noticed for the first time a silent mutation in rd ##rp gene in england ( uk ) on february 9th , 2020 while a different mutation in rd ##rp changing its amino acid composition emerged on february 20th , 2020 in italy ( lombardy ) . viruses with rd ##rp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [ range : 2 – 5 ] , otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [ range : 0 – 3 ] ( p value < 0 . 001 ) . conclusions : these findings suggest that the virus is evolving and european , north american and asian strains might coe ##xi ##st , each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern . the contribution of the mu ##tated rd ##rp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated . to date , several drugs targeting rd ##rp enzymes are being employed for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection treatment . some of them have a predicted binding moi ##ety in a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp hydro ##phobic cl ##eft , which is adjacent to the 144 ##0 ##8 mutation we identified . consequently , it is important to study and character ##ize sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp mutation in
background : during the current worldwide pan ##de ##mic , corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) was first diagnosed in iceland at the end of february . however , data are limited on how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the virus that causes co ##vid - 19 , enters and spreads in a population . methods : we targeted testing to persons living in iceland who were at high risk for infection ( mainly those who were sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , had recently traveled to high - risk countries , or had contact with infected persons ) . we also carried out population screening using two strategies : issuing an open invitation to 10 , 79 ##7 persons and sending random invitations to 228 ##3 persons . we sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from 64 ##3 samples . results : as of april 4 , a total of 122 ##1 of 91 ##9 ##9 persons ( 13 . 3 % ) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . of those tested in the general population , 87 ( 0 . 8 % ) in the open - invitation screening and 13 ( 0 . 6 % ) in the random - population screening tested positive for the virus . in total , 6 % of the population was screened . most persons in the targeted - testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally , in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study . children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older , with percentage ##s of 6 . 7 % and 13 . 7 % , respectively , for targeted testing ; in the population screening , no child under 10 years of age had a positive result , as compared with 0 . 8 % of those 10 years of age or older . fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing ( 11 . 0 % vs . 16 . 7 % ) and in population screening ( 0 . 6 % vs . 0 . 9 % ) . the ha ##pl ##otype ##s of the sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses were diverse and changed over time . the percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20 - day duration of screening . conclusions : in a population - based study in iceland , children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection than adolescents or adults and males . the proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period , which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts .

objectives : to describe the loss of para ##med ##ic availability to toronto emergency medical services during a bi ##pha ##sic ( sar ##s ‐ 1 and sar ##s ‐ 2 ) outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . methods : during the sar ##s outbreak , a dedicated para ##med ##ic surveillance and qu ##aran ##tine program was developed . the authors determined the number of para ##med ##ics on qu ##aran ##tine each day , the type of qu ##aran ##tine ( either home qu ##aran ##tine [ hq ] or work qu ##aran ##tine [ w ##q ] ) , and the development of sar ##s ‐ like symptoms . results : during the sar ##s outbreak , there were five cases of probable sar ##s and three cases of suspect sar ##s . sar ##s ‐ 1 lasted 30 days , during which 234 para ##med ##ics were placed on hq . the total number of hq days was 1 , 61 ##5 . during the five peak days of sar ##s ‐ 1 , the total number of hq days was 66 ##4 . sar ##s ‐ 2 lasted 18 days , during which 292 para ##med ##ics were placed on either hq or w ##q , for a combined number of qu ##aran ##tine days of 1 , 63 ##7 . during the five peak days of sar ##s ‐ 2 , the combined number of qu ##aran ##tine days was 910 . of these , para ##med ##ics were available for duty on 70 ##8 days ( 78 % ) due to the w ##q program . the primary reason for qu ##aran ##tine was un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure to a health care institution experiencing a sar ##s outbreak . under qu ##aran ##tine , sar ##s ‐ like symptoms developed in 68 para ##med ##ics , including cough ( 53 [ 78 % ] ) , my ##al ##gia ( 33 [ 48 % ] ) , fatigue ( 30 [ 44 % ] ) , headache ( 29 [ 43 % ] ) , fever ( 11 [ 16 % ] ) , and short ##ness of breath ( 7 [ 10 % ] ) . conclusions : para ##med ##ics were among the health care workers who developed sar ##s . during sar ##s ‐ 2 , w ##q opt ##imi ##zed the number of days on which para ##med ##ics were available for duty . many para ##med ##ics developed sar ##s ‐ like symptoms without being diagnosed as having sar ##s . a dedicated para ##med ##ic surveillance and qu ##aran ##tine program provided a useful means to manage the para ##med ##ic resource during the sar ##s outbreak .  
objectives : this was a study to evaluate the utilization of emergency medical services ( ems ) systems during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , and to assess the incidence of infection among emergency medical technicians ( em ##ts ) . methods : this was a prospective , observation ##al study conducted in the ems system of taipei , taiwan . probable / suspect cases of sar ##s were defined by world health organization criteria . sar ##s ‐ related transports were categorized into 1 ) requests from hospitals for probable / suspect cases of sar ##s , 2 ) qu ##aran ##tine ##d individuals , and 3 ) feb ##ril ##e persons . city ambulance ##s were organized into teams a , b , and c for transports of different perceived risks . data on the ems volume , the transport category , the final sar ##s status of patients , and the em ##t responsible for the transports were collected . the ems projected volume was computed by previous years ' data and compared with that collected . the sar ##s incidence among em ##ts was assessed by investigating probable sar ##s ( p ‐ sar ##s ) and by surveying the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of sar ##s ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) antibody . results : from march 18 to june 19 , 2003 , there were 7 , 96 ##1 ems transports , similar to the volume projected from previous years ( 7 , 50 ##6 ) ( 95 % ci = 6 , 68 ##8 to 8 , 324 ) . of these , 1 , 760 ( 22 . 1 % ) were sar ##s ‐ related . when sar ##s ‐ related transports were excluded , there was a 12 . 2 % decrease ( 95 % ci = 11 . 4 % to 12 . 9 % ) in ems activities . requests from hospitals , qu ##aran ##tine ##d individuals , and feb ##ril ##e citizens accounted for 23 % , 18 % , and 59 % of sar ##s ‐ related transports . among the 39 ##7 p ‐ sar ##s cases in the city of 2 . 65 million people ( incidence 0 . 01 % , 95 % ci = 0 . 01 % to 0 . 02 % ) , 138 ( 35 % ) required ems transports . two em ##ts working in team c , the team with the lowest risk , developed p ‐ sar ##s . one of them died soon thereafter . the incidence of p ‐ sar ##s was 0 . 6 % ( 95 % ci = 0 . 2 % to 2 . 2 % ) , or 0 . 1 % ( 95 % ci = 0 . 03 % to 0 . 4 % ) per transport . sar ##s ‐ co ##v ser ##ology was available in 74 . 1 % of em
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently described infectious entity with sal ##ient features of fever , headache and mala ##ise , with rapid progression to p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis . the et ##iology of sar ##s is likely a novel corona ##virus . during the winter of 2003 , an outbreak of sar ##s involving several hospitals occurred in toronto , canada . we describe a patient post liver transplant who contracted sar ##s and died during the outbreak , with subsequent infection of family and several health ‐ care workers . a novel corona ##virus was detected in respiratory specimens by pc ##r . due to the potential severity of sar ##s in transplant recipients and the large number of cases of sar ##s in the community , in order to avoid transmission of sar ##s from a donor , we developed guidelines for sar ##s screening of organ donors . a screening tool based on potential hospital sar ##s exposure , clinical symptoms , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological exposure was used to st ##rat ##ify donors as high , intermediate or low risk for sar ##s . as sar ##s spreads throughout the world , it may become an increasingly significant problem for transplant patients and programs .  
the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , previously known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) outbreak has engulfed an un ##pre ##par ##ed world amidst a fest ##ive season . the zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , believed to have originated from infected bats , is the seventh member of enveloped rna corona ##virus . specifically , the overall genome sequence of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is 96 . 2 % identical to that of bat corona ##virus termed bat ##co ##v rat ##g ##13 . although the current mortality rate of 2 % is significantly lower than that of sar ##s ( 9 . 6 % ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) ( 35 % ) , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is highly con ##tag ##ious and trans ##missible from human to human with an inc ##uba ##tion period of up to 24 days . some statistical studies have shown that , on average , one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5 . 7 confirmed cases . since the first reported case of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 on december 1 , 2019 , in wu ##han , china , there has been a total of 60 , 412 confirmed cases with 137 ##0 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of february 13 , 2020 . the outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels . this paper is a review of the significant , continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days . although no vaccines have been discovered yet , a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments , especially in china , in the effort to prevent further outbreak , whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients . on the basis of current studies , it would appear that the combined anti ##vira ##l treatment has shown the highest success rate . this review aims to critically sum ##mar ##ize the most recent advances in understanding the corona ##virus , as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment .  
the sudden outbreak of 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov , later named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in wu ##han , china , which rapidly grew into a global pan ##de ##mic , marked the third introduction of a vi ##ru ##lent corona ##virus into the human society , affecting not only the healthcare system , but also the global economy . although our understanding of corona ##virus ##es has undergone a huge leap after two precedent ##s , the effective approaches to treatment and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological control are still lacking . in this article , we present a su ##cci ##nc ##t overview of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical features , and molecular characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we sum ##mar ##ize the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical data from the initial wu ##han studies , and emphasize several features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which differentiate it from sar ##s - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , such as high variability of disease presentation . we system ##ati ##ze the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . whereas the trials on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome - based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested , this solution is more long - term , as they require thorough testing of their safety . on the other hand , the rep ##ur ##po ##sing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and path ##ologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emerge ##nt pan ##de ##mic , as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety . these agents can be divided into two broad categories , those that can directly target the virus replication cycle , and those based on im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py approaches either aimed to boost innate anti ##vira ##l immune responses or alleviate damage induced by d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated inflammatory responses . the initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs , including fa ##vi ##pi ##ra ##vir , a broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drug that interfere ##s with the viral replication , and hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , the rep ##ur ##posed anti ##mal ##aria ##l drug that interfere ##s with the virus end ##osomal entry pathway . we spec ##ulate that the current pan ##de ##mic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing design approaches based on big data analysis .  
background / aims : corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections induce respiratory tract illnesses and central nervous system ( cn ##s ) diseases . we aimed to explore the cy ##tok ##ine expression profiles in hospitalized children with co ##v - cn ##s and co ##v - respiratory tract infections . methods : a total of 183 and 236 hospitalized children with acute en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is - like syndrome and respiratory tract infection , respectively , were screened for anti - co ##v i ##gm antibodies . the expression profiles of multiple cy ##tok ##ines were determined in co ##v - positive patients . results : anti - co ##v i ##gm antibodies were detected in 22 / 183 ( 12 . 02 % ) and 26 / 236 ( 11 . 02 % ) patients with acute en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is - like syndrome and respiratory tract infection , respectively . cy ##tok ##ine analysis revealed that the level of serum gran ##ulo ##cy ##te colony - stimulating factor ( g - cs ##f ) was significantly higher in both co ##v - cn ##s and co ##v - respiratory tract infection compared with healthy controls . additionally , the serum level of gran ##ulo ##cy ##te macro ##pha ##ge colony - stimulating factor ( gm - cs ##f ) was significantly higher in co ##v - cn ##s infection than in co ##v - respiratory tract infection . in patients with co ##v - cn ##s infection , the levels of il - 6 , il - 8 , mc ##p - 1 , and gm - cs ##f were significantly higher in their ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid samples than in matched serum samples . conclusion : to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report showing a high incidence of co ##v infection in hospitalized children , especially with cn ##s illness . the characteristic cy ##tok ##ine expression profiles in co ##v infection indicate the importance of host immune response in disease progression .  
the aim of the present study is to investigate changes of inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) production occurring over the first 48 h after infection of peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) and to compare these changes to those induced by well - established if ##n - inducing viruses , such as ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis ( vs ##v ) and newcastle viruses ( n ##d ##v ) . experiments have been carried out using p ##bm ##cs of 10 different healthy donors . the results showed that the anti ##vira ##l activity of if ##n contained in the super ##nat ##ant of sar ##s - co ##v - infected p ##bm ##cs was lower than those induced by vs ##v and n ##d ##v . consequently , sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s a lower synthesis of if ##n - α , - β and - γ compared to vs ##v and n ##d ##v . characterization of the profile of if ##n - α sub ##type ##s genes expression in sar ##s - co ##v - infected p ##bm ##cs demonstrated that the level of if ##n - α ##2 and − ##6 sub ##type ##s were higher compared to other if ##n - α sub ##type ##s namely , if ##n - α ##5 , − ##8 , − ##10 , − ##13 / 1 , − ##17 , and − ##21 . in conclusion , sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s if ##ns to a less extent compared to vs ##v and n ##d ##v , thus suggesting that the if ##n system does play a limited role in early host defense against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
coin ##fect ##ion of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) with tuberculosis ( tb ) has not been previously reported . here , we present 2 cases with both mer ##s - co ##v and pulmonary tb . the first case was a 13 - year - old patient who was admitted with a 2 - month history of fever , weight loss , night sweat ##s , and cough . the second patient was a 30 - year - old female who had a 4 - week history of cough associated with short ##ness of breath and weight loss of 2 kg . the 2 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tb and had positive mer ##s - co ##v . both patients were discharged to complete their therapy for tb at home . it is likely that both patients had pulmonary tb initially as they had prolonged symptoms and they subsequently developed mer ##s - co ##v infection . it is important to carefully evaluate suspected mer ##s - co ##v patients for the presence of other infectious diseases , such as tb , especially if co ##hort ##ing is done for suspected mer ##s - co ##v to avoid nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission .  
inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - α , - β and - γ have been shown to be only marginal ##ly effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication in ve ##ro cell lines . we investigated the combination of type i if ##ns ( if ##n - α or - β ) and if ##n - γ for anti ##vira ##l activity and found that such combinations syn ##er ##gist ##ically inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication in ve ##ro cells , using yield reduction ass ##ay and the iso ##bol ##og ##ram and combination index methods of cho ##u and tal ##ala ##y for evaluation . the highly syn ##er ##gist ##ic anti - sar ##s - co ##v action of type i if ##ns and if ##n - γ parallels the marked increase in 2 ′ - 5 ′ - ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late synth ##eta ##se and p ##56 mrna ##s following exposure in ve ##ro cells to either if ##n - α or - β and if ##n - γ compared with the transcription ##al levels obtained after stimulation with either if ##n alone . these results demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v , although only moderately sensitive to the anti ##vira ##l action of the individual types of if ##n , is highly sensitive to a combination of type i and ii if ##ns , which suggests that such combinations may have potential in the treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infections .  
the efficacy of several po ##vid ##one - io ##dine ( pv ##p - i ) products , a number of other chemical agents and various physical conditions were evaluated for their ability to ina ##ct ##ivate the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . treatment of sar ##s - co ##v with pv ##p - i products for 2 min reduced the virus in ##fect ##ivity from 1 . 17 × 10 ( 6 ) tc ##id ( 50 ) / ml to below the detect ##able level . the efficacy of 70 % ethanol was equivalent to that of pv ##p - i products . fix ##ation of sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells with a fix ##ative including formal ##in , g ##lu ##tara ##lde ##hy ##de , met ##han ##ol and ace ##tone for 5 min or longer eliminated all in ##fect ##ivity . heating the virus at 56 ##° ##c for 60 min or longer reduced the in ##fect ##ivity of the virus from 2 . 6 × 10 ( 7 ) to und ##ete ##ctable levels . ir ##rad ##iation with ultraviolet light at 134 μ ##w / cm ( 2 ) for 15 min reduced the in ##fect ##ivity from 3 . 8 × 10 ( 7 ) to 180 tc ##id ( 50 ) / ml ; however , prolonged ir ##rad ##iation ( 60 min ) failed to eliminate the remaining virus , leaving 18 . 8 tc ##id ( 50 ) / ml .  
objective : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious and lethal disease caused by a new type of corona ##virus , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . currently , there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease . we constructed rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##ira ##l vectors that can express sh ##rna ##s , which inhibit ##ed the expression of sar ##s - co ##v genes effectively in mammalian cells . methods : in this study , we designed several pl ##as ##mi ##ds that express small hair ##pin rna molecules ( sh ##rna ) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein and envelope ( e ) protein , respectively . effective sh ##rna molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified , and then constructed into aden ##ov ##irus vectors . the effects of aden ##ov ##irus - delivered small hair ##pin rna on sar ##s - co ##v gene expression were determined by rt - pc ##r , western b ##lot , and lucifer ##ase activity ass ##ays . results : the levels of viral mrna ##s and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibit ##ed in cell lines after being infected with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus ##es that expressed specific sh ##rna molecules . conclusions : since many cell types can be efficiently infected by aden ##ov ##irus , rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus ##es could serve as an alternative powerful tool for sh ##rna delivery and for gene suppression , especially when the targeted cells are resistant to trans ##fect ##ion by dna or rna . with availability of high ti ##ters of aden ##ov ##irus ##es and uniform and rapid infection , this approach would have fore ##see ##able wide applications both in experimental biology and molecular medicine .  
background : in late december 2019 , chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in wu ##han , hub ##ei province . summary : a few days later , the genome of a novel corona ##virus was released ( http : / / vi ##rol ##ogical . org / t / novel - 2019 - corona ##virus - genome / 319 ; wu ##han - hu - 1 , gen ##bank accession no . mn ##90 ##8 ##9 ##47 ) and made publicly available to the scientific community . this novel corona ##virus was provisional ##ly named 2019 - nc ##ov , now sar ##s - co ##v - 2 according to the corona ##virus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 belongs to the corona ##vir ##idae family , beta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus , subgenus sar ##be ##co ##virus . since its discovery , the virus has spread globally , causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the current knowledge about the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , ph ##yl ##ogen ##esis , homo ##logy modeling , and molecular diagnostic ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . key messages : phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution , whereas homo ##logy modeling is important for vaccine strategies and the ##ra ##pies . highly sensitive and specific diagnostic ass ##ays are key to case identification , contact tracing , identification of the animal source , and implementation of control measures .  
objective : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a severe pulmonary infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus . to develop an effective and specific medicine targeting the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , a chi ##meric dna - rna hammer ##head rib ##oz ##yme was designed and synthesized using a sequence homo ##log ##ous with the mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) . method : chi ##meric dna - rna hammer ##head rib ##oz ##yme targeting m ##h ##v and sar ##s - co ##v were designed and synthesized . to confirm its activity , in vitro cleavage reactions were performed with the synthesized rib ##oz ##yme . effects of the chi ##meric rib ##oz ##yme were evaluated on multiplication of m ##h ##v . effects of the chi ##meric rib ##oz ##yme on expression of sar ##s - co ##v were evaluated in culture ##d 3 ##t ##3 cells . result : the synthetic rib ##oz ##yme cl ##ea ##ved the synthetic target m ##h ##v and sar ##s - co ##v rna into fragments of predicted length . the chi ##meric dna - rna hammer ##head rib ##oz ##yme targeting sar ##s - co ##v significantly inhibit ##ed multiplication of m ##h ##v in db ##t cells by about 60 % . the chi ##meric dna - rna hammer ##head rib ##oz ##yme targeting sar ##s - co ##v significantly inhibit ##ed the expression of sar ##s - co ##v rna in 3 ##t ##3 cells trans ##fect ##ed with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d . the chi ##meric dna - rna rib ##oz ##yme targeting sar ##s - co ##v significantly inhibit ##ed m ##h ##v viral activity and expression of rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s rna in vitro . conclusion : these findings indicate that the synthetic chi ##meric dna - rna rib ##oz ##yme could provide a feasible treatment for sar ##s .  
objective : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a new corona ##virus . gen ##omic sequence analysis will provide the molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and help to develop vaccines . methods : we developed a rapid method to amp ##li ##fy and sequence the whole sar ##s - co ##v genome from clinical specimens . the technique employed one - step multiple ##x rt - pc ##r to amp ##li ##fy the whole sar ##s - co ##v genome , and then nest ##ed pc ##r was performed to amp ##li ##fy a 2 - kb region separately . the pc ##r products were sequence ##d . results : we sequence ##d the genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##v from 3 clinical specimens obtained in taiwan . the sequences were similar to those reported by other groups , except that 17 single nu ##cle ##otide variations and two 2 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##ons , and a 1 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on were found . all the variations in the clinical specimens did not alter the amino acid sequence . of these 17 sequence ##d variants , two lo ##ci ( positions 262 ##0 ##3 and 278 ##12 ) were segregated together as a specific gen ##otype - t : t or c : c . phylogenetic analysis showed two major clusters of sar ##s patients in taiwan . conclusion : we developed a very economical and rapid method to sequence the whole genome of sar ##s - co ##v , which can avoid cultural influence . from our results , sar ##s patients in taiwan may be infected from two different origins .  
currently , the expansion of the novel human respiratory corona ##virus ( known as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 [ severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ] , co ##vid - 2019 [ corona ##virus disease 2019 ] , or 2019 - nc ##ov [ 2019 novel corona ##virus ] ) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic . the previous epidemic ##s of infections by high - mor ##bid ##ity human corona ##virus ##es , such as sar ##s - co ##v in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the most promising compound is re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( gs - 57 ##34 ) , a nu ##cle ##otide analog pro ##dr ##ug currently in clinical trials for treating e ##bola virus infections . re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir inhibit ##ed the replication of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in tissue cultures , and it displayed efficacy in non ##hum ##an animal models . in addition , a combination of the human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) pro ##tea ##se inhibitors lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r and inter ##fer ##on beta ( lp ##v / rt ##v – if ##n - β ) was shown to be effective in patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v . lp ##v / rt ##v – if ##n - β also improved clinical parameters in mar ##mos ##ets and mice infected with mer ##s - co ##v . remarkably , the therapeutic efficacy of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir appeared to be superior to that of lp ##v / rt ##v – if ##n - β against mer ##s - co ##v in a trans ##genic human ##ized mouse model . the relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human corona ##virus infections , sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , have suggested that pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory responses might play a role in the pathogen ##esis . it remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted . therapeutic ##s that target the corona ##virus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogen ##ic infections . this mini ##re ##view aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections .  
the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which was identified after a recent outbreak in wu ##han , china , in december 2019 , has kept the whole world in tent ##er ##ho ##ok ##s due to its severe life - threatening nature of the infection . the virus is unlike its previous counterparts , sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of vi ##ru ##lence and severity of the infection . if scientific reports relevant to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus are noted , it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) protein , which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain access ##es to its hosts . recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting ; the human brain may soon emerge as the new ab ##ode of the virus . already instances of patients with co ##vid - 19 have been reported with mild ( an ##os ##mia and age ##usia ) to severe ( en ##ce ##pha ##lo ##pathy ) neurological manifestation ##s , and if that is so , then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus . keeping in mind that the situation does not worse ##n from here , immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the ne ##uro ##in ##vas ##ive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour . scientists globally also need to up their game to design more specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counter ##act the pan ##de ##mic . in this viewpoint , we provide a brief outline of the currently known neurological manifestation ##s of co ##vid - 19 and discuss some probable ways to design therapeutic strategies to overcome the present global crisis .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the et ##iol ##ogical agent responsible for the global co ##vid - 19 outbreak . the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in media ##ting viral replication and transcription . we designed and synthesized two lead compounds ( 11 ##a and 11 ##b ) targeting m ( pro ) . both exhibited excellent inhibitor ##y activity and potent anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection activity . the x - ray crystal structures of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 m ( pro ) in complex with 11 ##a or 11 ##b , both determined at 1 . 5 a resolution , showed that the al ##deh ##yde groups of 11 ##a and 11 ##b are co ##valent ##ly bound to cy ##s ##14 ##5 of m ( pro ) . both compounds showed good p ##k properties in vivo , and 11 ##a also exhibited low toxicity , suggesting that these compounds are promising drug candidates .  
the new decade of the 21 ( st ) century ( 2020 ) started with the emergence of a novel corona ##virus known as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that caused an epidemic of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) in wu ##han , china . it is the third highly pathogen ##ic and trans ##missible corona ##virus after severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in humans . the source of origin , transmission to humans , and mechanisms associated with the pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are not yet clear , however , its resemblance to sar ##s - co ##v and several other bat corona ##virus ##es was recently confirmed through genome sequencing - related studies . the development of therapeutic strategies is necessary in order to prevent further epidemic ##s and cure infections . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize current information about the emergence , origin , diversity , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of three pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es with a specific focus on the current outbreak in wu ##han , china . furthermore , we discuss the clinical features and potential therapeutic options that may be effective against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
[ image : see text ] since the emergence of a novel corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was first reported from wu ##han , china , neither a specific vaccine nor an anti ##vira ##l drug against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has become available . however , a combination of two hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors , lo ##pina ##vir and ri ##ton ##avi ##r , has been found to be effective against sar ##s - co ##v , and both drugs could bind well to the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) . in this work , molecular complex ##ation between each inhibitor and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ( pro ) was studied using all - atom molecular dynamics simulations , free energy calculations , and pair interaction energy analyses based on mm / p ##b ( gb ) sa and fm ##o - mp ##2 / pc ##m / 6 - 31 ##g * methods . both anti - hiv drugs interact ##ed well with the residues at the active site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ( pro ) . ri ##ton ##avi ##r showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts , a somewhat higher binding efficiency , and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lo ##pina ##vir , which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3 ##cl ( pro ) active site . in addition , only ri ##ton ##avi ##r could interact with the ox ##yan ##ion hole residues n ##14 ##2 and g ##14 ##3 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds . the interactions in terms of electro ##static ##s , di ##sper ##sion , and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding . the obtained results demonstrated how rep ##ur ##posed anti - hiv drugs could be used to combat co ##vid - 19 .  
the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a recent outbreak of an at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , known as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , has been identified as a corona ##virus ( co ##v ) not belonging to any of the previously identified groups . fusion of corona ##virus ##es with the host cell is mediated by the envelope spike protein . two regions within the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v have been identified , showing a high degree of sequence conservation with the other co ##v , which are characterized by the presence of he ##pta ##d repeats ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) . by using synthetic and rec ##om ##bina ##nt peptide ##s corresponding to the hr ##1 and hr ##2 regions , we were able to character ##ize the fusion - active complex formed by this novel co ##v by cd , native page , pro ##te ##ol ##ysis protection analysis , and size - exclusion ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy . hr ##1 and hr ##2 of sar ##s - co ##v associate into an anti ##para ##lle ##l six - helix bundle , with structural features typical of the other known class i fusion proteins . we have also mapped the specific boundaries of the region , within the longer hr ##1 domain , making contact with the shorter hr ##2 domain . notably , the inner hr ##1 coiled coil is a stable α - he ##lica ##l domain even in the absence of interaction with the hr ##2 region . inhibitors binding to hr regions of fusion proteins have been shown to be e ##ffi ##ca ##cious against many viruses , notably hiv . our results may help in the design of anti - sar ##s therapeutic ##s .  
although the finding of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in cage ##d palm ci ##vet ##s from live animal markets in china has provided evidence for inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission in the genesis of the sar ##s epidemic , subsequent studies suggested that the ci ##vet may have served only as an amp ##li ##fication host for sar ##s - co ##v . in a surveillance study for co ##v in non ##ca ##ged animals from the wild areas of the hong kong special administration region , we identified a co ##v closely related to sar ##s - co ##v ( bat - sar ##s - co ##v ) from 23 ( 39 % ) of 59 anal sw ##ab ##s of wild chinese horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus ) by using rt - pc ##r . sequencing and analysis of three bat - sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s from samples collected at different dates showed that bat - sar ##s - co ##v is closely related to sar ##s - co ##v from humans and ci ##vet ##s . phylogenetic analysis showed that bat - sar ##s - co ##v formed a distinct cluster with sar ##s - co ##v as group 2 ##b co ##v , distant ##ly related to known group 2 co ##v . most differences between the bat - sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s were observed in the spike genes , or ##f 3 and or ##f 8 , which are the regions where most variations also were observed between human and ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s . in addition , the presence of a 29 - bp insertion in or ##f 8 of bat - sar ##s - co ##v genome , not in most human sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s , suggests that it has a common ancestor with ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v . antibody against rec ##om ##bina ##nt bat - sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein was detected in 84 % of chinese horseshoe bats by using an enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y . neutral ##izing antibody to human sar ##s - co ##v also was detected in bats with lower viral loads . precautions should be exercised in the handling of these animals .  
rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike protein - based im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys were developed and evaluated . our ass ##ays demonstrated high sensitivity and specific ##ity to the sar ##s corona ##virus in sera collected from patients as late as 2 years post ##ons ##et of symptoms . these ass ##ays will be useful not only for routine sar ##s corona ##virus diagnostic ##s but also for ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and antibody kinetic studies .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) utilizes host pro ##tea ##ses for virus entry into lung cells . in the current study , ve ##ro cells con ##sti ##tu ##tively expressing type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se ( ve ##ro - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cells ) showed larger sync ##yt ##ia at 18 h after infection with mer ##s - co ##v than after infection with other corona ##virus ##es . furthermore , the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of ve ##ro - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cells to mer ##s - co ##v was 100 - fold higher than that of non - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - expressing parental ve ##ro cells . the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se inhibitor cam ##osta ##t , which inhibit ##s t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activity , completely blocked sync ##yt ##ium formation but only partially blocked virus entry into ve ##ro - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cells . importantly , the corona ##virus is thought to enter cells via two distinct pathways , one mediated by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 at the cell surface and the other mediated by cat ##he ##ps ##in l in the end ##oso ##me . simultaneous treatment with inhibitors of cat ##he ##ps ##in l and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 completely blocked virus entry into ve ##ro - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cells , indicating that mer ##s - co ##v employs both the cell surface and the end ##osomal pathway to in ##fect ve ##ro - t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cells . in contrast , a single cam ##osta ##t treatment suppressed mer ##s - co ##v entry into human bro ##nch ##ial sub ##mu ##cos ##al gland - derived cal ##u - 3 cells by 10 - fold and virus growth by 270 - fold , although treatment with both cam ##osta ##t and ( 23 , 25 ) - trans - ep ##ox ##ys ##ucci ##ny ##l - l - le ##uc ##yla ##mind ##o - 3 - methyl ##bu ##tan ##e et ##hyl este ##r , a cat ##he ##ps ##in inhibitor , or treatment with le ##up ##ept ##in , an inhibitor of cy ##stein ##e , ser ##ine , and th ##re ##oni ##ne pep ##ti ##das ##es , was no more e ##ffi ##ca ##cious than treatment with cam ##osta ##t alone . further , these inhibitors were not e ##ffi ##ca ##cious against mer ##s - co ##v infection of mr ##c - 5 and wi - 38 cells , which were derived from lung , but these characters differed from those of mature p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . these results suggest that a single treatment with cam ##osta ##t is sufficient to block mer ##s - co ##v entry into a well - differentiated lung - derived cell line .  
despite extensive laboratory investigations in patients with respiratory tract infections , no micro ##bio ##logical cause can be identified in a significant proportion of patients . in the past 3 years , several novel respiratory viruses , including human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and human corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 , were discovered . here we report the discovery of another novel corona ##virus , corona ##virus hk ##u ##1 ( co ##v - hk ##u ##1 ) , from a 71 - year - old man with pneumonia who had just returned from shenzhen , china . quantitative reverse transcription - pc ##r showed that the amount of co ##v - hk ##u ##1 rna was 8 . 5 to 9 . 6 × 10 ( 6 ) copies per ml in his nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates ( np ##as ) during the first week of the illness and dropped progressively to und ##ete ##ctable levels in subsequent weeks . he developed increasing serum levels of specific antibodies against the rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of co ##v - hk ##u ##1 , with im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin m ( i ##gm ) ti ##ters of 1 : 20 , 1 : 40 , and 1 : 80 and i ##gg ti ##ters of < 1 : 1 , 000 , 1 : 2 , 000 , and 1 : 8 , 000 in the first , second and fourth weeks of the illness , respectively . isolation of the virus by using various cell lines , mixed ne ##uron - g ##lia culture , and intra ##cer ##eb ##ral in ##oc ##ulation of suck ##ling mice was unsuccessful . the complete genome sequence of co ##v - hk ##u ##1 is a 29 , 92 ##6 - nu ##cle ##otide , poly ##ade ##ny ##lated rna , with g + c content of 32 % , the lowest among all known corona ##virus ##es with available genome sequence . phylogenetic analysis reveals that co ##v - hk ##u ##1 is a new group 2 corona ##virus . screening of 400 np ##as , negative for sar ##s - co ##v , from patients with respiratory illness during the sar ##s period identified the presence of co ##v - hk ##u ##1 rna in an additional specimen , with a viral load of 1 . 13 × 10 ( 6 ) copies per ml , from a 35 - year - old woman with pneumonia . our data support the existence of a novel group 2 corona ##virus associated with pneumonia in humans .  
although many severe acute respiratory syndrome - like corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - like co ##vs ) have been identified in bats in china , europe , and africa , most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human / ci ##vet sar ##s co ##vs in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , which media ##tes receptor binding and determines the host spectrum , resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely pro ##gen ##itors of human / ci ##vet sar ##s co ##vs . here , a viral meta ##gen ##omic analysis of 268 bat rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s collected from four counties in yunnan province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha - and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase gene revealed that alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es had divers ##ities with some obvious differences from those reported previously . full gen ##omic analysis of a new sar ##s - like co ##v from bao ##shan ( l ##yra ##11 ) showed that it was 29 , 80 ##5 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ( nt ) in length with 13 open reading frames ( or ##fs ) , sharing 91 % nu ##cle ##otide identity with human / ci ##vet sar ##s co ##vs and the most recently reported sar ##s - like co ##v rs ##33 ##6 ##7 , while sharing 89 % with other bat sar ##s - like co ##vs . notably , it showed the highest sequence identity with the s gene of sar ##s co ##vs and rs ##33 ##6 ##7 , especially in the rb ##d region . antigen ##ic analysis showed that the s ##1 domain of l ##yra ##11 could be efficiently recognized by sar ##s - con ##vale ##scent human serum , indicating that l ##yra ##11 is a novel virus antigen ##ically close to sar ##s co ##v . rec ##om ##bina ##tion analyses indicate that l ##yra ##11 is likely a rec ##om ##bina ##nt descended from parental lineage ##s that had evolved into a number of bat sar ##s - like co ##vs . importance although many severe acute respiratory syndrome - like corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - like co ##vs ) have been discovered in bats worldwide , there are significant different gen ##ic structures , particularly in the s ##1 domain , which are responsible for host tr ##op ##ism determination , between bat sar ##s - like co ##vs and human sar ##s co ##vs , indicating that most reported bat sar ##s - like co ##vs are not the pro ##gen ##itors of human sar ##s co ##v . we have identified diverse alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es and a close relative ( l ##yra ##11 ) to sar ##s co ##v in bats collected in yunnan , china . further analysis showed that alpha - and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es have different
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes 3 major envelope proteins : spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) , and envelope ( e ) . previous work identified a di ##bas ##ic end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum retrieval signal in the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of sar ##s - co ##v s that promotes efficient interaction with sar ##s - co ##v m . the di ##bas ##ic signal was shown to be important for concentrating s near the virus assembly site rather than for direct interaction with m . here , we investigated the sequence requirements of the sar ##s - co ##v m protein that are necessary for interaction with sar ##s - co ##v s . the sar ##s - co ##v m tail was shown to be necessary for s local ##ization in the go ##l ##gi region when the proteins were ex ##ogen ##ously coe ##x ##pressed in cells . this was specific , since sar ##s - co ##v m did not retain an unrelated g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein in the go ##l ##gi . importantly , we found that an essential ty ##ros ##ine residue in the sar ##s - co ##v m cy ##top ##las ##mic tail , y ( 195 ) , was important for s - m interaction . when y ( 195 ) was mu ##tated to alan ##ine , m ( y ##19 ##5 ##a ) no longer retained s intra ##cellular ##ly at the go ##l ##gi . unlike wild - type m , m ( y ##19 ##5 ##a ) did not reduce the amount of sar ##s - co ##v s car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te processing or surface levels when the two proteins were coe ##x ##pressed . mu ##tat ##ing y ( 195 ) also disrupted sar ##s - co ##v s - m interaction in vitro . these results suggest that y ( 195 ) is necessary for efficient sar ##s - co ##v s - m interaction and , thus , has a significant involvement in assembly of infectious virus .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes severe pneumonia with a fatal outcome in approximately 10 % of patients . sar ##s - co ##v is not closely related to other corona ##virus ##es but shares a similar genome organization . entry of corona ##virus ##es into target cells is mediated by the viral s protein . we functional ##ly analyzed sar ##s - co ##v s using pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles ( pseudo ##type ##s ) . the sar ##s - co ##v s protein was found to be expressed at the cell surface upon transient trans ##fect ##ion . coe ##x ##press ##ion of sar ##s - co ##v s with human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus - based reporter construct ##s yielded viruses that were infectious for a range of cell lines . most notably , viral pseudo ##type ##s harbor ##ing sar ##s - co ##v s infected he ##pa ##tom ##a cell lines but not t - and b - cell lines . infection of the he ##pa ##tom ##a cell line huh - 7 was also observed with replication - competent sar ##s - co ##v , indicating that he ##pa ##to ##cytes might be targeted by sar ##s - co ##v in vivo . inhibition of va ##cu ##olar acid ##ification impaired infection by sar ##s - co ##v s - bearing pseudo ##type ##s , indicating that s - mediated entry requires low ph . finally , infection by sar ##s - co ##v s pseudo ##type ##s but not by ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus g pseudo ##type ##s was efficiently inhibit ##ed by a rabbit serum raised against sar ##s - co ##v particles and by sera from sar ##s patients , demonstrating that sar ##s - co ##v s is a target for neutral ##izing antibodies and that such antibodies are generated in sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients . our results show that viral pseudo ##ty ##ping can be employed for the analysis of sar ##s - co ##v s function . moreover , we provide evidence that sar ##s - co ##v infection might not be limited to lung tissue and can be inhibit ##ed by the humor ##al immune response in infected patients .  
first identified in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is caused by an emerging human corona ##virus , which is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and represents a novel member of the lineage c beta ##cor ##ono ##virus ##es . since its identification , mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been linked to more than 137 ##2 infections manifest ##ing with severe mor ##bid ##ity and , often , mortality ( about 495 deaths ) in the arabian peninsula , europe , and , most recently , the united states . human - to - human transmission has been documented , with nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission appearing to be an important route of infection . the recent increase in cases of mer ##s in the middle east coupled with the lack of approved anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies or vaccines to treat or prevent this infection are causes for concern . we report on the development of a synthetic dna vaccine against mer ##s - co ##v . an opt ##imi ##zed dna vaccine encoding the mer ##s spike protein induced potent cellular immunity and antigen - specific neutral ##izing antibodies in mice , mac ##aq ##ues , and camel ##s . va ##cci ##nated r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues ser ##oco ##n ##verted rapidly and exhibited high levels of virus - neutral ##izing activity . upon mer ##s viral challenge , all of the monkeys in the control - va ##cci ##nated group developed characteristic disease , including pneumonia . va ##cci ##nated mac ##aq ##ues were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radio ##graphic signs of pneumonia . these studies demonstrate that a consensus mer ##s spike protein synthetic dna vaccine can induce protective responses against viral challenge , indicating that this strategy may have value as a possible vaccine mod ##ality against this emerging pathogen .  
we report the isolation and characterization of a novel bat corona ##virus which is much closer to the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in gen ##omic sequence than others previously reported , particularly in its s gene . cell entry and su ##sc ##ept ##ibility studies indicated that this virus can use ace ##2 as a receptor and in ##fect animal and human cell lines . our results provide further evidence of the bat origin of the sar ##s - co ##v and highlight the likelihood of future bat corona ##virus emergence in humans .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic was characterized by high mortality rates in the elderly . the molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of elderly populations are not known , and robust animal models are needed that rec ##ap ##it ##ulate the increased pathogen ##ic ph ##eno ##type noted with increasing age . using synthetic biology and reverse genetics , we describe the construction of a panel of iso ##genic sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) strains bearing variant spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s that are representative of zoo ##not ##ic strains found in palm ci ##vet ##s and ra ##cco ##on dogs , as well as isolate ##s spanning the early , middle , and late phases of the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic . the rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses replicate ##d efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sen ##sit ##iv ##ities to neutral ##ization with antibodies . the human but not the zoo ##not ##ic variants replicate ##d efficiently in human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cultures , supporting earlier h ##yp ##oth ##eses that zoo ##not ##ic isolate ##s are less pathogen ##ic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogen ##ic strains . all viruses replicate ##d efficiently , but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals . in contrast , severe clinical disease , diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , h ##yal ##ine membrane formation , al ##ve ##oli ##tis , and death were noted in 12 - month - old mice in ##oc ##ulated with the palm ci ##vet hc / s ##z / 61 / 03 strain or early - human - phase g ##z ##0 ##2 variants but not with related middle - and late - phase epidemic or ra ##cco ##on dog strains . this panel of sar ##s - co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nts bearing zoo ##not ##ic and human epidemic spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s will provide het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoo ##not ##ic rein ##tro ##duction ##s as well as provide the appropriate model system for el ##uc ##ida ##ting the complex virus - host interactions that contribute to more - severe and fatal sar ##s - co ##v disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly .  
the main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays an essential role in the extensive pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the viral poly ##pro ##tein ##s ( pp ##1 ##a and pp ##1 ##ab ) , and it is an important target for anti - sar ##s drug development . it was found that sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) exists in solution as an equilibrium of both mono ##meric and dime ##ric forms , and the dime ##ric form is the en ##zy ##matic ##ally active form . however , the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) dime ##rization , especially the roles of its n - terminal seven residues ( n - finger ) and its unique c - terminal domain in the dime ##rization , remain unclear . here we report that the sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) c - terminal domain alone ( residues 187 to 306 ; m ( pro ) - c ) is produced in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli in both mono ##meric and dime ##ric forms , and no exchange could be observed between them at room temperature . the m ( pro ) - c dime ##r has a novel dime ##rization interface . meanwhile , the n - finger del ##eti ##on mutant of sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) also exists as both a stable mono ##mer and a stable dime ##r , and the dime ##r is formed through the same c - terminal - domain interaction as that in the m ( pro ) - c dime ##r . however , no c - terminal domain - mediated dime ##rization form can be detected for wild - type sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) . our study results help to clarify previously published controversial claims about the role of the n - finger in sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) dime ##rization . apparently , without the n - finger , sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) can no longer retain the active dime ##r structure ; instead , it can form a new type of dime ##r which is inactive . therefore , the n - finger of sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) is not only critical for its dime ##rization but also essential for the enzyme to form the en ##zy ##matic ##ally active dime ##r .  
the proteins encoded by gene 7 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) have been demonstrated to have pro ##ap ##op ##to ##tic activity when expressed from cd ##na but appear to be di ##sp ##ens ##able for virus replication . rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##vs bearing del ##eti ##ons in gene 7 were used to assess the contribution of gene 7 to virus replication and ap ##op ##tosis in several transformed cell lines , as well as to replication and pathogen ##esis in golden syrian ham ##sters . del ##eti ##on of gene 7 had no effect on sar ##s - co ##v replication in transformed cell lines , nor did it alter the induction of early ap ##op ##tosis markers such as annex ##in v binding and activation of cas ##pas ##e 3 . however , viruses with gene 7 disruption ##s were not as efficient as wild - type virus in inducing dna fragmentation , as judged by terminal de ##ox ##yn ##uc ##le ##ot ##id ##yl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se - mediated du ##tp - bio ##tin nick end labeling ( tune ##l ) stain ##ing , indicating that the gene 7 products do contribute to virus - induced ap ##op ##tosis . disruption of gene 7 did not affect virus replication or mor ##bid ##ity in golden syrian ham ##sters , suggesting that the gene 7 products are not required for acute infection in vivo . the data indicate that open reading frames 7 ##a and 7 ##b contribute to but are not solely responsible for the ap ##op ##tosis seen in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells .  
the highly pathogen ##ic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) poses a constant threat to human health . the viral spike protein ( sar ##s - s ) media ##tes host cell entry and is a potential target for anti ##vira ##l intervention . activation of sar ##s - s by host cell pro ##tea ##ses is essential for sar ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##ivity but remains incomplete ##ly understood . here , we analyzed the role of the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses ( tt ##sp ##s ) human air ##way try ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( hat ) and trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se , ser ##ine 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) , in sar ##s - s activation . we found that hat activate ##s sar ##s - s in the context of sur ##rogate systems and authentic sar ##s - co ##v infection and is coe ##x ##pressed with the viral receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) in bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells and p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . hat cl ##ea ##ved sar ##s - s at r ##66 ##7 , as determined by mu ##tage ##nes ##is and mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry , and activated sar ##s - s for cell - cell fusion in cis and trans , while the related pulmonary pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 cl ##ea ##ved sar ##s - s at multiple sites and activated sar ##s - s only in trans . however , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 but not hat expression rendered sar ##s - s - driven virus - cell fusion independent of cat ##he ##ps ##in activity , indicating that hat and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activate sar ##s - s differential ##ly . collectively , our results show that hat cl ##ea ##ves and activate ##s sar ##s - s and might support viral spread in patients .  
in 2012 , a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , designated middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus or mer ##s - co ##v and associated with severe respiratory disease in humans , emerged in the arabian peninsula . to date , 108 human cases have been reported , including cases of human - to - human transmission . the availability of an animal disease model is essential for understanding pathogen ##esis and developing effective counter ##me ##as ##ures . upon a combination of intra ##tra ##che ##al , o ##cular , oral , and intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation with 7 × 10 ( 6 ) 50 % tissue culture infectious dose of the mer ##s - co ##v isolate hc ##ov - em ##c / 2012 , r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection . clinical signs , virus shed ##ding , virus replication in respiratory tissues , gene expression , and cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e profiles peaked early in infection and decreased over time . mer ##s - co ##v caused a multi ##fo ##cal , mild to marked inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia , with virus replication occurring mainly in al ##ve ##olar p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . this tr ##op ##ism of mer ##s - co ##v for the lower respiratory tract may explain the severity of the disease observed in humans and the , up to now , limited human - to - human transmission .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerged disease that rapidly spread around the world . the disease originated in southern china and a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) has been implicated as the ca ##usa ##tive organism . the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery , though preliminary data point to origins in an animal reservoir . nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of sar ##s co ##v has been a striking feature in this epidemic . the clinical illness is similar to many acute respiratory infections , although a large proportion of patients show a rapid deterioration with respiratory distress towards the end of the second week of illness . the management principles are broadly similar to treating any community acquired pneumonia but the infection control measures take a pivotal role . there is no proven anti ##vira ##l agent against sar ##s co ##v . the most remarkable feature about the sar ##s epidemic was the speed with which the global community acted in a coordinated way to control it .  
the distribution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) receptor , an ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , does not strictly co ##rre ##late with sar ##s - co ##v cell tr ##op ##ism in lungs ; therefore , other cellular factors have been predicted to be required for activation of virus infection . in the present study , we identified trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se ser ##ine 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) , whose expression does co ##rre ##late with sar ##s - co ##v infection in the upper lobe of the lung . in ve ##ro cells expressing t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , large sync ##yt ##ia were induced by sar ##s - co ##v infection . further , the l ##ys ##oso ##me - tr ##op ##ic re ##age ##nts failed to inhibit , whereas the he ##pta ##d repeat peptide efficiently inhibit ##ed viral entry into cells , suggesting that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 affects the s protein at the cell surface and induce ##s virus - plasma membrane fusion . on the other hand , production of virus in t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - expressing cells did not result in s - protein cleavage or increased in ##fect ##ivity of the resulting virus . thus , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 affects the entry of virus but not other phases of virus replication . we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that the spatial orientation of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 vis - a - vis s protein is a key mechanism under ##ling this phenomenon . to test this , the t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and s proteins were expressed in cells labeled with fluorescent probe ##s of different colors , and the cell - cell fusion between these cells was tested . results indicate that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 needs to be expressed in the opposing ( target ) cell membrane to activate s protein rather than in the producer cell , as found for influenza a virus and meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus ##es . this is the first report of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 being required in the target cell for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the s protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells . our findings suggest that the t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 expressed in lung tissues may be a deter ##mina ##nt of viral tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##ici ##ty at the initial site of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the ser ##ological response profile of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection was defined by neutral ##ization tests and sub ##class - specific im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent ( if ) tests using serial sera from 20 patients . sar ##s co ##v total im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) ( i ##gg , i ##ga , and i ##gm [ i ##gga ##m ] ) was the first antibody to be detect ##able . there was no difference in time to ser ##oco ##n ##version between the patients who survived ( n = 14 ) and those who died ( n = 6 ) . although sar ##s co ##v i ##gm was still detect ##able by if tests with 8 of 11 patients at 7 months post ##in ##fect ##ion , the geometric mean ti ##ters dropped from 282 at 1 month post ##in ##fect ##ion to 19 at 7 months ( p = 0 . 001 ) . in contrast , neutral ##izing antibody and sar ##s co ##v i ##gga ##m and i ##gg antibody ti ##ters remained stable over this period . the sar ##s co ##v antibody response was sometimes associated with an increase in pre ##ex ##ist ##ing if i ##gg antibody ti ##ters for human corona ##virus ##es o ##c ##43 , 229 ##e , and nl ##6 ##3 . there was no change in if i ##gg ti ##ter for virus caps ##id antigen from the her ##pes ##virus that was used as an unrelated control , epstein - barr virus . in contrast , patients who had o ##c ##43 infections , and probably also 229 ##e infections , without prior exposure to sar ##s co ##v had increases of antibodies specific for the in ##fect ##ing virus but not for sar ##s co ##v . there is a need for awareness of cross - reactive antibody responses between corona ##virus ##es when interpreting if ser ##ology .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is highly pathogen ##ic in humans , with a death rate near 10 % . this high pathogen ##ici ##ty suggests that sar ##s - co ##v has developed mechanisms to overcome the host innate immune response . it has now been determined that sar ##s - co ##v open reading frame ( or ##f ) 3 ##b , or ##f 6 , and n proteins ant ##ago ##ni ##ze inter ##fer ##on , a key component of the innate immune response . all three proteins inhibit the expression of beta inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - β ) , and further examination revealed that these sar ##s - co ##v proteins inhibit a key protein necessary for the expression of if ##n - β , ir ##f - 3 . n protein dramatically inhibit ##ed expression from an n ##f - κ ##b - responsive promoter . all three proteins were able to inhibit expression from an inter ##fer ##on - stimulated response element ( is ##re ) promoter after infection with send ##ai virus , while only or ##f 3 ##b and or ##f 6 proteins were able to inhibit expression from the is ##re promoter after treatment with inter ##fer ##on . this indicates that n protein inhibit ##s only the synthesis of inter ##fer ##on , while or ##f 3 ##b and or ##f 6 proteins inhibit both inter ##fer ##on synthesis and signaling . or ##f 6 protein , but not or ##f 3 ##b or n protein , inhibit ##ed nuclear trans ##lo ##cation but not ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of stat ##1 . thus , it appears that these three inter ##fer ##on antagonist ##s of sar ##s - co ##v inhibit the inter ##fer ##on response by different mechanisms .  
the recent appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) highlights the continual threat to human health posed by emerging viruses . however , the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear , particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species . we outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence . we emphasize that , although the high mutation rates of rna viruses provide them with great adapt ##ability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases , their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints . understanding the me ##chan ##istic basis of these constraints , particularly the roles played by ep ##ista ##sis and pl ##ei ##ot ##rop ##y , is likely to be central in explaining why some rna viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries . viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v , with the suggestion that this virus is a rec ##om ##bina ##nt between mammalian and av ##ian corona ##virus ##es . we show , however , that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for rec ##om ##bina ##tion are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineage ##s and that rec ##om ##bina ##tion is unlikely to explain the appearance of sar ##s in humans .  
similar to other corona ##virus ##es , the membrane ( m ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a major trans ##me ##mb ##rane g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein with multiple biological functions . to date , limited information is available about its antigen ##ic properties . in this study , we identified two major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes on the m protein located in the extreme n - terminal region ( residues 1 to 31 ) and the interior c - terminal region ( residues 132 to 161 ) , respectively , by pep ##scan analyses against con ##vale ##scent - phase sera from sar ##s patients and anti ##ser ##a from virus - im ##mun ##ized mice and rabbits . synthetic peptide ##s m1 - 31 derived from the n - terminal ep ##ito ##pe and m1 ##32 - 161 derived from the c - terminal ep ##ito ##pe were highly reactive with all of the con ##vale ##scent - phase sera from 40 sar ##s patients but not with 30 control serum samples from healthy blood donors , suggesting their potential application for ser ##olo ##gic diagnosis of sar ##s . we showed that both peptide ##s ( m1 - 31 and m1 ##32 - 161 ) were able to induce high ti ##ters of antibody responses in the im ##mun ##ized rabbits , highlighting their antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . these findings provide important information for developing sar ##s diagnostic ##s and vaccines .  
ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is a terminal car ##box ##ype ##pt ##ida ##se and the receptor for the sar ##s and nl ##6 ##3 corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) . loss of ace ##2 function is implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) pathogen ##esis , but little is known about ace ##2 bio ##genesis and activity in the airways . we report that ace ##2 is shed from human air ##way ep ##ith ##elia , a site of sar ##s - co ##v infection . the regulation of ace ##2 release was investigated in polar ##ized human air ##way ep ##ith ##elia . con ##sti ##tu ##tive generation of soluble ace ##2 was inhibit ##ed by d ##pc 333 , imp ##lica ##ting a di ##sin ##te ##grin and metal ##lo ##pro ##tea ##se 17 ( adam ##17 ) . ph ##or ##bol este ##r , ion ##omy ##cin , end ##oto ##xin , and il - 1 ##β and tn ##f ##α acute ##ly induced ace ##2 release , further supporting that adam ##17 and adam ##10 regulate ace ##2 cleavage . soluble ace ##2 was en ##zy ##matic ##ally active and partially inhibit ##ed virus entry into target cells . we determined that the ace ##2 cleavage site resides between amino acid 71 ##6 and the put ##ative trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain starting at amino acid 74 ##1 . to reveal structural deter ##mina ##nts underlying ace ##2 release , several mutant and chi ##meric ace ##2 proteins were engineered . neither the ju ##xt ##ame ##mb ##rane stalk region , trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain , nor the cy ##tos ##olic domain was needed for con ##sti ##tu ##tive ace ##2 release . interesting ##ly , a point mutation in the ace ##2 ec ##to ##dom ##ain , l ##58 ##4 ##a , markedly at ##ten ##uated shed ##ding . the resultant ace ##2 - l ##58 ##4 ##a mutant traffic ##ked to the cell membrane and facilitated sar ##s - co ##v entry into target cells , suggesting that the ace ##2 ec ##to ##dom ##ain regulates its release and that residue l ##58 ##4 might be part of a put ##ative shed ##das ##e “ recognition motif . ” thus ace ##2 must be cell associated to serve as a co ##v receptor and soluble ace ##2 might play a role in modifying inflammatory processes at the air ##way mu ##cos ##al surface .  
the relationship between bats and corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) has received considerable attention since the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like co ##v was identified in the chinese horseshoe bat ( rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae ) in 2005 . since then , several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed co ##v sequences , and presumably co ##vs , in the fe ##ces ; however , no bat co ##vs have been isolated from nature . moreover , there are very few bat cell lines or re ##age ##nts available for investigating co ##v replication in bat cells or for iso ##lating bat co ##vs adapted to specific bat species . here , we show by molecular clock analysis that alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ( α - co ##v ) sequences derived from the north american tri ##color ##ed bat ( per ##im ##yo ##tis sub ##fl ##av ##us ) are predicted to share common ancestry with human co ##v ( hc ##ov ) - nl ##6 ##3 , with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 56 ##3 to 82 ##2 years ago . further , we developed immortal ##ized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with hc ##ov ##s . while sar ##s - co ##v , mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v ( ma ##15 ) , and chi ##meric sar ##s - co ##vs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicate ##d in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##ntly , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 replicate ##d for multiple passages in the immortal ##ized lung cells from this bat species . these observations support the hypothesis that human co ##vs are capable of establishing zoo ##not ##ic - reverse zoo ##not ##ic transmission cycles that may allow some co ##vs to readily ci ##rc ##ulate and exchange genetic material between strains found in bats and other mammals , including humans .  
the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) contains four structural genes , two replica ##se - transcript ##ase open reading frames , and more than five potential genes of unknown function . despite this relative simplicity , the molecular regulation of sar ##s - co ##v replication and assembly is not understood . here , we report that two viral genes , encoding the sar ##s - co ##v membrane ( m ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins , are necessary and sufficient for formation of virus - like particles . expression vectors encoding these two proteins were synthesized by using preferred human cod ##ons . when m and n expression pl ##as ##mi ##ds were cot ##ran ##sf ##ect ##ed into human 293 renal ep ##ith ##elial cells , pseudo ##par ##tic ##les formed readily . the addition of a third gene , encoding the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , facilitated bud ##ding of particles that contained a corona - like halo resembling sar ##s - co ##v when examined by transmission electron microscopy , with a bu ##oya ##nt density characteristic of corona ##virus ##es . specific bio ##chemical interactions of these proteins were also shown in vitro . the s , m , and n proteins of the sar ##s - co ##v are , therefore , necessary and sufficient for pseudo ##virus assembly . these findings advance the understanding of the mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v and enable the generation of safe , conform ##ation ##al mi ##met ##ics of the sar ##s virus that may facilitate the development of vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs .  
we have previously shown that ss ##ya ##10 - 001 blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication by inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se ( ns ##p ##13 ) . here , we show that ss ##ya ##10 - 001 also inhibit ##s replication of two other corona ##virus ##es , mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . a put ##ative binding pocket for ss ##ya ##10 - 001 was identified and shown to be similar in sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , and m ##h ##v he ##lica ##ses . these studies show that it is possible to target multiple corona ##virus ##es through broad - spectrum inhibitors .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak of 2002 and 2003 occurred as a result of zoo ##not ##ic transmission . corona ##virus ( co ##v ) found in naturally infected palm ci ##vet ( ci ##vet - co ##v ) represents the closest genetic relative to sar ##s - co ##v , but the degree and the deter ##mina ##nts of cross - neutral ##ization among these viruses remain to be investigated . studies indicate that the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein contains major deter ##mina ##nts for viral entry and neutral ##ization . we aim to character ##ize the impact of natural mutations within the rb ##ds of ci ##vet - co ##vs on viral entry and cross - neutral ##ization . in this study , the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein genes were recovered from naturally infected ci ##vet ##s in central china ( hub ##ei province ) , extending the geographic distribution of ci ##vet - co ##v beyond the southeastern province of guangdong . moreover , pseudo ##virus ##es generated in our laboratory with four ci ##vet s genes , each with a distinct rb ##d , infected cells expressing human receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , but with 90 to 95 % less efficiency compared to that of sar ##s - co ##v . these four ci ##vet s genes were also constructed as dna vaccines to im ##mun ##ize mice . im ##mun ##ized sera eli ##cite ##d against most ci ##vet s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s displayed potent neutral ##izing activities against auto ##log ##ous viruses but were much less efficient ( 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration , 20 - to 40 - fold ) at neutral ##izing sar ##s - co ##v and vice versa . con ##vale ##sc ##ence - phase sera from humans were similarly ineffective against the dominant ci ##vet pseudo ##virus . our findings suggest that the design of sar ##s vaccine should consider not only preventing the re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of sar ##s - co ##v but also providing cross - protection , thus interrupting zoo ##not ##ic transmission of a group of genetically diver ##gent ci ##vet co ##vs of broad geographic origin .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused an acute human respiratory illness with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in 2002 - 2003 . several studies have demonstrated the role of neutral ##izing antibodies induced by the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein in protecting susceptible hosts from lethal infection . however , the anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibody response is short - lived in patients who have recovered from sar ##s , making it critical to develop additional vaccine strategies . sar ##s - co ##v - specific memory cd ##8 t cells persisted for up to 6 years after sar ##s - co ##v infection , a time at which memory b cells and anti ##virus antibodies were und ##ete ##ctable in individuals who had recovered from sar ##s . in this study , we assessed the ability of virus - specific memory cd ##8 t cells to media ##te protection against infection in the absence of sar ##s - co ##v - specific memory cd ##4 t or b cells . we demonstrate that memory cd ##8 t cells specific for a single im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pe ( s ##43 ##6 or s ##52 ##5 ) substantially protected 8 - to 10 - month - old mice from lethal sar ##s - co ##v infection . intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##ization with peptide - loaded den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) followed by intra ##nas ##al boost ##ing with rec ##om ##bina ##nt va ##cci ##nia virus ( rv ##v ) encoding s ##43 ##6 or s ##52 ##5 resulted in accumulation of virus - specific memory cd ##8 t cells in bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid ( bal ) , lungs , and sp ##leen . upon challenge with a lethal dose of sar ##s - co ##v , virus - specific memory cd ##8 t cells efficiently produced multiple effect ##or cy ##tok ##ines ( gamma inter ##fer ##on [ if ##n - γ ] , tumor nec ##rosis factor alpha [ tn ##f - α ] , and inter ##le ##uki ##n 2 [ il - 2 ] ) and cy ##to ##ly ##tic molecules ( gran ##zy ##me b ) and reduced lung viral loads . overall , our results show that sar ##s - co ##v - specific memory cd ##8 t cells protect susceptible hosts from lethal sar ##s - co ##v infection , but they also suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - specific cd ##4 t cell and antibody responses are necessary for complete protection . importance virus - specific cd ##8 t cells are required for pathogen clearance following primary sar ##s - co ##v infection . however , the role of sar ##s - co ##v - specific memory cd ##8 t cells in media ##ting protection after sar ##s - co ##v challenge has not been previously investigated . in this study
over the past 30 years , several cross - species transmission events , as well as changes in virus tr ##op ##ism , have mediated significant animal and human diseases . most notable is severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a lower respiratory tract disease of humans that was first reported in late 2002 in guangdong province , china . the disease , which quickly spread worldwide over a period of 4 months spanning late 2002 and early 2003 , infected over 8 , 000 individuals and killed nearly 800 before it was successfully contained by aggressive public health intervention strategies . a corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s , and initial assessments determined that the virus crossed to human hosts from zoo ##not ##ic reservoirs , including bats , himalayan palm ci ##vet ##s ( pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta ) , and ra ##cco ##on dogs ( nyc ##ter ##eu ##tes pro ##cy ##ono ##ides ) , sold in exotic animal markets in guangdong province . in this review , we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern corona ##virus cross - species transmission both in vitro and in vivo , using the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v as a model . we pay particular attention to how changes in the spike attachment protein , both within and outside of the receptor binding domain , media ##te the emergence of corona ##virus ##es in new host populations .  
im ##mun ##ization with a killed or inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) . however , the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) viruses . in this study , we generated a sar ##s vaccine candidate by using the live - at ##ten ##uated modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) as a vector . the full - length sar ##s - co ##v envelope spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gene was introduced into the del ##eti ##on iii region of the mv ##a genome . the newly generated rec ##om ##bina ##nt mv ##a , ads - mv ##a , is replication inc ##omp ##ete ##nt in mammalian cells and highly im ##mun ##ogenic in terms of inducing potent neutral ##izing antibodies in mice , rabbits , and monkeys . after two intra ##mus ##cular va ##cci ##nation ##s with ads - mv ##a alone , the 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dil ##ution ##s of more than 1 , 000 - to 10 , 000 - fold in these animals . using fragmented s genes as im ##mun ##ogen ##s , we also mapped a neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pe in the region of n - terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ##400 - 600 ) , which overlap ##s with the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor - binding region ( rb ##r ; s ##31 ##8 - 510 ) . moreover , using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt soluble rb ##r - fc protein , we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutral ##izing antibodies despite observing that the full s protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutral ##izing activities in comparison with fragmented s proteins . our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutral ##izing sar ##s - co ##v likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ace ##2 . in addition , ads - mv ##a induced potent immune responses which very likely protected chinese r ##hes ##us monkeys from pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v challenge .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) recently emerged as a severe worldwide public health concern . the virus is highly pathogen ##ic , manifest ##ing in infected patients with an approximately 50 % fatal ##ity rate . it is known that the surface spike ( s ) proteins of corona ##virus ##es media ##te receptor recognition and membrane fusion , thereby playing an ind ##is ##pen ##sable role in initiating infection . in this process , he ##pta ##d repeats 1 and 2 ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) of the s protein assemble into a complex called the fusion core , which represents a key membrane fusion architecture . to date , however , the mer ##s - co ##v fusion core remains un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized . in this study , we performed a series of bio ##chemical and bio ##physical analyses character ##izing the hr ##1 / hr ##2 complexes of this novel virus . the hr sequences were var ##ia ##bly truncated and then connected with a flexible amino acid link ##er . in each case , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein automatically assembled into a trim ##er in solution , displaying a typical α - he ##lica ##l structure . one of these trim ##ers was successfully crystal ##lized , and its structure was solved at a resolution of 1 . 9 a . a canonical 6 - helix bundle , like those reported for other corona ##virus ##es , was revealed , with three hr ##1 he ##lices forming the central coiled - coil core and three hr ##2 chains surrounding the core in the hr ##1 side grooves . this demonstrates that mer ##s - co ##v utilizes a mechanism similar to those of other class i enveloped viruses for membrane fusion . with this notion , we further identified an hr ##2 - based peptide that could potent ##ly inhibit mer ##s - co ##v fusion and entry by using a pseudo ##type ##d - virus system . these results lay the ground ##work for future inhibitor ##y pep ##ti ##dic drug design .  
the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , is associated with severe pneumonia and renal failure . the environmental origin of mer ##s - co ##v is as yet unknown ; however , its genome sequence is closely related to those of two bat corona ##virus ##es , named bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 and bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 , which were derived from chinese bat samples . a hallmark of highly pathogen ##ic respiratory viruses is their ability to evade the innate immune response of the host . co ##v accessory proteins , for example those from severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , have been shown to block innate anti ##vira ##l signalling pathways . mer ##s - co ##v , similar to sar ##s - co ##v , has been shown to inhibit type i if ##n induction in a variety of cell types in vitro . we therefore h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that mer ##s - co ##v and the phylogenetic ##ally related bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 and bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 may en ##code proteins with similar capabilities . in this study , we have demonstrated that the or ##f ##4 ##b - encoded accessory protein ( p ##4 ##b ) of mer ##s - co ##v , bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 and bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 may indeed facilitate innate immune eva ##sion by inhibit ##ing the type i if ##n and n ##f - κ ##b signalling pathways . we also anal ##yse ##d the sub ##cellular local ##ization of p ##4 ##b from mer ##s - co ##v , bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##4 and bt ##co ##v - hk ##u ##5 and demonstrated that all are localized to the nucleus .  
a new enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) - based im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) - plus - i ##gm antibody detection test for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been developed by using a cocktail of four rec ##om ##bina ##nt poly ##pe ##pt ##ides as the antigen . these rec ##om ##bina ##nt fragments were designed as parts of two different structural proteins from sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . one rec ##om ##bina ##nt poly ##pe ##pt ##ide , s ##25 ##1 - 68 ##3 , was designed as part of the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , and the other three poly ##pe ##pt ##ides comprised almost the whole nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , avoiding the last 25 c - terminal amino acids . im ##mun ##ization with a cocktail of these four poly ##pe ##pt ##ides yielded a specific poly ##cl ##onal antibody that is able to recognize sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells by an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay . this poly ##pe ##pt ##ide cocktail was also used to set up an elisa - based i ##gg - plus - i ##gm antibody detection test , which showed 99 % specific ##ity and 90 % sensitivity upon evaluation using sera from 100 healthy negative controls and 20 sar ##s patients . separate im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity ass ##ays with each rec ##om ##bina ##nt poly ##pe ##pt ##ide demonstrated that a combination of n and s protein fragments was more suitable than the individual peptide ##s for developing a ser ##ological ass ##ay for sar ##s - co ##v .  
we investigated the contributions of the structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) to protective immunity by expressing them individually and in combinations from a rec ##om ##bina ##nt para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus ( pi ##v ) type 3 vector called bhp ##iv ##3 . this vector provided direct im ##mun ##ization of the respiratory tract , the major site of sar ##s transmission , replication , and disease . the bhp ##iv ##3 / sar ##s rec ##om ##bina ##nts were evaluated for im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protective efficacy in ham ##sters , which support a high level of pulmonary sar ##s - co ##v replication . a single intra ##nas ##al administration of bhp ##iv ##3 expressing the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein ( s ) induced a high ti ##ter of sar ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing serum antibodies , only 2 - fold less than that induced by sar ##s - co ##v infection . the expression of s with the two other put ##ative vi ##rion envelope proteins , the matrix m and small envelope e proteins , did not aug ##ment the neutral ##izing antibody response . in absence of s , expression of m and e or the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein n did not induce a detect ##able serum sar ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing antibody response . im ##mun ##ization with bhp ##iv ##3 expressing s provided complete protection against sar ##s - co ##v challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract . this was augmented slightly by coe ##x ##press ##ion with m and e . expression of m , e , or n in the absence of s did not con ##fer detect ##able protection . these results identify s among the structural proteins as the only significant sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##ization antigen and protective antigen and show that a single mu ##cos ##al im ##mun ##ization is highly protective in an experimental animal that supports efficient replication of sar ##s - co ##v .  
newly emerging viruses , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle eastern respiratory syndrome co ##vs ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and h ##7 ##n ##9 , cause fatal acute lung injury ( ali ) by driving hyper ##cy ##tok ##ine ##mia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive . in sar ##s - co ##v / mac ##aq ##ue models , we determined that anti – spike i ##gg ( s - i ##gg ) , in productive ##ly infected lungs , causes severe ali by sk ##ew ##ing inflammation - resolving response . al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges underwent functional polar ##ization in acute ##ly infected mac ##aq ##ues , demonstrating simultaneously both pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory and wound - healing characteristics . the presence of s - i ##gg prior to viral clearance , however , ab ##rogated wound - healing responses and promoted mc ##p ##1 and il - 8 production and pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory mono ##cy ##te / macro ##pha ##ge recruitment and accumulation . critically , patients who eventually died of sar ##s ( here ##af ##ter referred to as deceased patients ) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory , absence of wound - healing macro ##pha ##ges , and faster neutral ##izing antibody responses . their sera enhanced sar ##s - co ##v – induced mc ##p ##1 and il - 8 production by human mono ##cy ##te – derived wound - healing macro ##pha ##ges , whereas blockade of fc ##γ ##r reduced such effects . our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus - mediated ali , define a path ##ological consequence of viral specific antibody response , and provide a potential target for treatment of sar ##s - co ##v or other virus - mediated lung injury .  
high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) among camel ##s has been reported in kenya and other countries in africa . to date , the only report of mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity among humans in kenya is of two livestock keepers with no known contact with camel ##s . we assessed whether persons exposed to ser ##op ##osi ##tive camel ##s at household level had ser ##ological evidence of infection . in 2013 , 760 human and 87 ##9 camel sera were collected from 275 and 85 households respectively in mars ##abi ##t county . data on human and animal demographics and type of contact with camel ##s were collected . human and camel sera were tested for anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg using a commercial enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) test . human samples were confirmed by plaque reduction neutral ##ization test ( pr ##nt ) . log ##istic regression was used to identify factors associated with ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity . the median age of persons sampled was 30 years ( range : 5 – 90 ) and 50 % were males . a quarter ( 197 / 760 ) of the participants reported having had contact with camel ##s defined as milk ##ing , feeding , watering , slaughter ##ing , or herd ##ing . of the human sera , 18 ( 2 . 4 % ) were positive on elisa but negative by pr ##nt . of the camel sera , 79 ##1 ( 90 % ) were positive on elisa . on un ##ivar ##iate analysis , higher prevalence was observed in female and older camel ##s over 4 years of age ( p < 0 . 05 ) . on multi ##var ##iate analysis , only age remained significantly associated with increased odds of ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity . despite high ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce among camel ##s , there was no ser ##ological confirmation of mer ##s - co ##v infection among camel pastoral ##ists in mars ##abi ##t county . the high ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity suggests that mer ##s - co ##v or other closely related virus continues to ci ##rc ##ulate in camel ##s and highlights ongoing potential for animal - to - human transmission .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic was caused by the spread of a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed infectious agent , the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . here we show that sar ##s - co ##v could inhibit both virus - and inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - dependent signaling , two key steps of the anti ##vira ##l response . we mapped a strong inhibitor ##y activity to sar ##s - co ##v non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 1 ( ns ##p ##1 ) and show that expression of ns ##p ##1 significantly inhibit ##ed the activation of all three virus - dependent signaling pathways . we show that expression of ns ##p ##1 significantly inhibit ##ed if ##n - dependent signaling by decreasing the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation levels of stat ##1 while having little effect on those of stat ##2 , ja ##k ##1 , and ty ##k ##2 . we engineered an at ##ten ##uated mutant of ns ##p ##1 in sar ##s - co ##v through reverse genetics , and the resulting mutant virus was viable and replicate ##d as efficiently as wild - type virus in cells with a defective if ##n response . however , mutant virus replication was strongly at ##ten ##uated in cells with an intact if ##n response . thus , ns ##p ##1 is likely a vi ##ru ##lence factor that contributes to pathogen ##ici ##ty by favor ##ing sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a serious threat to public health and the economy on a global scale . the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent for sar ##s . thus , va ##cci ##nation against sar ##s - co ##v may represent an effective approach to controlling sar ##s . dna vaccines are an attractive approach for sar ##s vaccine development , as they offer many advantages over conventional vaccines , including stability , simplicity , and safety . our investigators have previously shown that dna va ##cci ##nation with antigen linked to cal ##ret ##ic ##ulin ( cr ##t ) dramatically enhance ##s major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex class i presentation of linked antigen to cd ##8 ( + ) t cells . in this study , we have employed this cr ##t - based enhancement strategy to create effective dna vaccines using sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein as a target antigen . va ##cci ##nation with naked cr ##t / n dna generated the most potent n - specific humor ##al and t - cell - mediated immune responses in va ##cci ##nated c ##57 ##bl / 6 mice among all of the dna construct ##s tested . furthermore , mice va ##cci ##nated with cr ##t / n dna were capable of significantly reducing the ti ##ter of challenging va ##cci ##nia virus expressing the n protein of the sar ##s virus . these results show that a dna vaccine encoding cr ##t linked to a sar ##s - co ##v antigen is capable of generating strong n - specific humor ##al and cellular immunity and may potentially be useful for control of infection with sar ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) targets the ep ##ith ##elial cells of the respiratory tract both in humans and in its natural host , the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel . vi ##rion attachment to host cells is mediated by 20 - nm - long homo ##tri ##mers of spike envelope protein s . the n - terminal subunit of each s proto ##mer , called s ##1 , folds into four distinct domains designated s ##1 ( a ) through s ##1 ( d ) . binding of mer ##s - co ##v to the cell surface entry receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) occurs via s ##1 ( b ) . we now demonstrate that in addition to d ##pp ##4 , mer ##s - co ##v binds to si ##alic acid ( si ##a ) . initially demonstrated by hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nation ass ##ay with human er ##yt ##hr ##ocytes and intact virus , mer ##s - co ##v si ##a - binding activity was assigned to s sub ##dom ##ain s ##1 ( a ) . when multi ##valent ##ly displayed on nano ##par ##tic ##les , s ##1 or s ##1 ( a ) bound to human er ##yt ##hr ##ocytes and to human mu ##cin in a strictly si ##a - dependent fashion . g ##ly ##can array analysis revealed a preference for α ##2 , 3 - linked si ##as over α ##2 , 6 - linked si ##as , which co ##rre ##lates with the differential distribution of α ##2 , 3 - linked si ##as and the predominant sites of mer ##s - co ##v replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of camel ##s and humans , respectively . binding is hampered by si ##a modifications such as 5 - n - g ##ly ##col ##yla ##tion and ( 7 , ) 9 - o - ace ##ty ##lation . de ##ple ##tion of cell surface si ##a by ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e treatment inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v entry of cal ##u - 3 human air ##way cells , thus providing direct evidence that virus – si ##a interactions may aid in vi ##rion attachment . the combined observations lead us to propose that high - specific ##ity , low - affinity attachment of mer ##s - co ##v to si ##alo ##gly ##cans during the pre ##att ##ach ##ment or early attachment phase may form another deter ##mina ##nt governing the host range and tissue tr ##op ##ism of this zoo ##not ##ic pathogen .  
based on their safety profile and ability to induce potent immune responses against infections , subunit vaccines have been used as candidates for a wide variety of pathogen ##s ( 1 - 3 ) . since the mammalian cell system is capable of post - translation ##al modification , thus forming properly folded and g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted proteins , rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins expressed in mammalian cells have shown the greatest potential to maintain high antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity ( 4 - 6 ) . although no new cases of sar ##s have been reported since 2004 , future outbreak ##s are a constant threat ; therefore , the development of vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v is a pr ##ude ##nt prevent ##ive step and should be carried out . the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v s protein plays important roles in receptor binding and induction of specific neutral ##izing antibodies against virus infection ( 7 - 9 ) . therefore , in this protocol , we describe novel methods for developing a rb ##d - based subunit vaccine against sar ##s . briefly , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d protein ( rr ##b ##d ) was expressed in culture super ##nat ##ant of mammalian 293 ##t cells to obtain a correctly folded protein with proper conform ##ation and high im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity ( 6 ) . the trans ##fect ##ion of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d encoding rb ##d to the cells was then performed using a calcium phosphate trans ##fect ##ion method ( 6 , 10 ) with some modifications . compared with the lip ##id trans ##fect ##ion method ( 11 , 12 ) , this modified calcium phosphate trans ##fect ##ion method is cheaper , easier to handle , and has the potential to reach high efficacy once a trans ##fect ##ion complex with suitable size and shape is formed ( 13 , 14 ) . finally , a sar ##s pseudo ##virus neutral ##ization ass ##ay was introduced in the protocol and used to detect the neutral ##izing activity of sera of mice va ##cci ##nated with rr ##b ##d protein . this ass ##ay is relatively safe , does not involve an infectious sar ##s - co ##v , and can be performed without the requirement of a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty - 3 laboratory ( 15 ) . the protocol described here can also be used to design and study rec ##om ##bina ##nt subunit vaccines against other viruses with class i fusion proteins , for example , hiv , respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus ( rs ##v ) , e ##bola virus , influenza virus , as well as ni ##pa ##h and hand ##ra viruses . in addition , the methods for generating a pseudo ##virus and subsequently establishing a pseudo ##virus neutral ##ization ass ##ay can be applied to all these viruses .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) became a worldwide outbreak with a mortality of 9 . 2 % . this new human emerge ##nt infectious disease is dominated by severe lower respiratory illness and is ae ##ti ##ological ##ly linked to a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . methods : pulmonary pathology and clinical co ##rre ##lates were investigated in seven patients who died of sar ##s in whom there was a strong ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link . investigations include a review of clinical features , morphological assessment , his ##to ##chemical and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical stain ##ings , ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural study , and vi ##rol ##ogical investigations in post ##mo ##rte ##m tissue . results : positive viral culture for corona ##virus was detected in most prem ##ort ##em nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate specimens ( five of six ) and post ##mo ##rte ##m lung tissues ( two of seven ) . viral particles , consistent with corona ##virus , could be detected in lung p ##ne ##um ##ocytes in most of the patients . these features suggested that p ##ne ##um ##ocytes are probably the primary target of infection . the path ##ological features were dominated by diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage , with the presence of multi ##nu ##cle ##ated p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . fi ##bro ##gra ##nu ##lation tissue proliferation in small airways and airspace ##s ( bro ##nch ##iol ##itis ob ##lite ##ran ##s organising pneumonia - like lesions ) in sub ##ple ##ural locations was also seen in some patients . conclusions : viable sar ##s - co ##v could be isolated from post ##mo ##rte ##m tissues . post ##mo ##rte ##m examination allows tissue to be sampled for vi ##rol ##ogical investigations and ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural examination , and when coupled with the appropriate lung morphological changes , is valuable to confirm the diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v , particularly in clinical ##ly una ##ppa ##rent or suspicious but un ##con ##firmed cases .  
per ##tur ##bation of the function of end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) causes stress leading to the activation of cell signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response ( up ##r ) . severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) uses er as a site for synthesis and processing of viral proteins . in this report , we demonstrate that infection with sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s the up ##r in culture ##d cells . a comparison with m , e , and ns ##p ##6 proteins indicates that sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein sufficiently induce ##s transcription ##al activation of several up ##r effect ##ors , including glucose - regulated protein 78 ( gr ##p ##7 ##8 ) , gr ##p ##9 ##4 , and c / e ##b ##p homo ##log ##ous protein . a substantial amount of s protein accumulate ##s in the er . the expression of s protein ex ##ert ##s different effects on the three major signaling pathways of the up ##r . particularly , it induce ##s gr ##p ##7 ##8 / 94 through p ##kr - like er kinase but has no influence on act ##ivating transcription factor 6 or x box - binding protein 1 . taken together , our findings suggest that sar ##s - co ##v s protein specifically mod ##ulates the up ##r to facilitate viral replication .  
advanced age has repeatedly been identified as an independent co ##rre ##late of adverse outcome and a predict ##or of mortality in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . sar ##s - associated mortality may exceed 50 % for persons aged 60 years or older . heightened su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of the elderly to severe sar ##s and the ability of sar ##s corona ##virus to replicate in mice led us to examine whether aged mice might be susceptible to disease . we report here that viral replication in aged mice was associated with clinical illness and pneumonia , demonstrating an age - related su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s disease in animals that parallels the human experience .  
the 3 ##c - like protein ##ase ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is one of the most promising targets for anti - sar ##s - co ##v drugs due to its crucial role in the viral life cycle . in this study , a database containing structural information of more than 8 , 000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . as a target for screening , both a homo ##logy model and the crystal ##log ##raphic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used . ci ##nan ##ser ##in ( sq 10 , 64 ##3 ) , a well - characterized ser ##oton ##in antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s , showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation . binding of both ci ##nan ##ser ##in and its hydro ##ch ##lor ##ide to bacterial ##ly expressed 3 ##cl ( pro ) of sar ##s - co ##v and the related human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) was demonstrated by surface pl ##as ##mon resonance technology . the catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibit ##ed with 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration ( ic ( 50 ) ) values of 5 μ ##m , as tested with a flu ##oro ##genic substrate . the anti ##vira ##l activity of ci ##nan ##ser ##in was further evaluated in tissue culture ass ##ays , namely , a rep ##lic ##on system based on hc ##ov - 229 ##e and quantitative test ass ##ays with infectious sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - 229 ##e . all ass ##ays revealed a strong inhibition of corona ##virus replication at non ##to ##xi ##c drug concentrations . the level of virus rna and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units , with ic ( 50 ) values ranging from 19 to 34 μ ##m . these findings demonstrate that the old drug ci ##nan ##ser ##in is an inhibitor of sar ##s - co ##v replication , acting most likely via inhibition of the 3 ##cl protein ##ase .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome with high mortality rates ( [UNK] % ) is associated with a novel group 2 ##c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus designated middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . we synthesized a panel of contiguous cd ##nas that spanned the entire genome . following con ##ti ##g assembly into genome - length cd ##na , trans ##fect ##ed full - length transcript ##s recovered several rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses ( rm ##ers - co ##v ) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones . because the wild - type mer ##s - co ##v contains a tissue culture - adapted t ##10 ##15 ##n mutation in the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , rm ##ers - co ##v replicate ##d [UNK] . 5 log less efficiently than wild - type virus . in addition , we ab ##lated expression of the accessory protein or ##f ##5 ( rm ##ers • or ##f ##5 ) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein ( rm ##ers - rf ##p ) or deleted the entire or ##f ##3 , 4 , and 5 accessory cluster ( rm ##ers - δ ##orf ##3 – 5 ) . rec ##om ##bina ##nt rm ##ers - co ##v , rm ##ers - co ##v • or ##f ##5 , and mer ##s - co ##v - rf ##p replicate ##d to high ti ##ters , whereas mer ##s - δ ##orf ##3 – 5 showed 1 – 1 . 5 logs reduced ti ##ter compared with rm ##ers - co ##v . northern b ##lot analyses confirmed the associated molecular changes in the rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses , and sequence analysis demonstrated that rf ##p was expressed from the appropriate consensus sequence aa ##c ##ga ##a . we further show dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 expression , mer ##s - co ##v replication , and rna and protein synthesis in human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cell cultures , primary lung fi ##bro ##bla ##sts , primary lung micro ##vas ##cular end ##oth ##elial cells , and primary al ##ve ##olar type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , demonstrating a much broader tissue tr ##op ##ism than severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus . the availability of a mer ##s - co ##v molecular clone , as well as rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses expressing indicator proteins , will allow for high - through ##put testing of therapeutic compounds and provide a genetic platform for studying gene function and the rational design of live virus vaccines .  
experimental studies were conducted to evaluate two species of cotton rats , si ##gm ##odon his ##pid ##us and si ##gm ##odon fu ##l ##vi ##vent ##er , as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . blood and tu ##rbin ##ate wash samples , and lung tissue were collected from each animal at different time points after sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection for determining the growth curve of virus , if any , by the standard in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ay in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . in addition , sections of the lung , liver , sp ##leen , and kidney were taken and used for his ##tology analysis . all animals were observed daily for signs of illness , and in some experiments , animals were weighed on the day when they were sacrificed . the results indicated that the cotton rat species , s . his ##pid ##us and s . fu ##l ##vi ##vent ##er , were not a useful model for either sar ##s - co ##v infection or disease . this observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness , the failure to consistently demonstrate virus in the blood and tissues , and the absent of any notable his ##top ##ath ##ology . however , infected animals were capable of producing neural ##izing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v , suggesting the ser ##oco ##n - version did occur . further studies are warrant ##ed to consider other animal species in efforts to find better animal models for the evaluation of sar ##s - co ##v vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs . key words : cotton rats — sar ##s — model animal .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by an emerge ##nt corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , for which there is currently no effective treatment . sar ##s - co ##v media ##tes receptor binding and entry by its spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , and infection is sensitive to l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic agents that per ##tur ##b end ##osomal ph . we demonstrate here that the l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic - agent - mediated block to sar ##s - co ##v infection is overcome by pro ##tea ##se treatment of target - cell - associated virus . in addition , sar ##s - co ##v infection was blocked by specific inhibitors of the ph - sensitive end ##osomal pro ##tea ##se cat ##he ##ps ##in l . a cell - free membrane - fusion system demonstrates that engagement of receptor followed by pro ##te ##ol ##ysis is required for sar ##s - co ##v membrane fusion and indicates that cat ##he ##ps ##in l is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by sar ##s - co ##v s . these results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v infection results from a unique , three - step process : receptor binding and induced conform ##ation ##al changes in s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein followed by cat ##he ##ps ##in l pro ##te ##ol ##ysis within end ##oso ##mes . the requirement for cat ##he ##ps ##in l pro ##te ##ol ##ysis identifies a previously un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized class of inhibitor for sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
in 2002 , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) appeared as a novel human virus with high similarity to bat corona ##virus ##es . however , while sar ##s - co ##v uses the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor for cellular entry , no corona ##virus isolated from bats appears to use ace ##2 . here we show that signatures of rec ##urrent positive selection in the bat ace ##2 gene map almost perfectly to known sar ##s - co ##v interaction surfaces . our data indicate that ace ##2 utilization preceded the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - like viruses from bats .  
replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) requires pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein by two viral cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses , a ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) and a papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) . these pro ##tea ##ses are important targets for development of anti ##vira ##l drugs that would inhibit viral replication and reduce mortality associated with outbreak ##s of sar ##s - co ##v . in this work , we describe the 1 . 85 - a crystal structure of the catalytic core of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro and show that the overall architecture adopt ##s a fold closely resembling that of known de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzymes . key features , however , distinguish pl ##pro from characterized de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzymes , including an intact zinc - binding motif , an uno ##bs ##truct ##ed catalytic ##ally competent active site , and the presence of an intriguing , u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like n - terminal domain . to gain insight into the active - site recognition of the c - terminal tail of u ##bi ##qui ##tin and the related l ##x ##gg motif , we propose a model of pl ##pro in complex with u ##bi ##qui ##tin – al ##deh ##yde that reveals well defined sites within the catalytic cl ##eft that help to account for strict substrate - recognition motifs .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected at least 77 people , with a fatal ##ity rate of more than 50 % . alarm ##ingly , the virus demonstrates the capability of human - to - human transmission , raising the possibility of global spread and end ##anger ##ing world health and economy . here we have identified the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) from the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and determined its crystal structure . this study also presents a structural comparison of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d with other corona ##virus rb ##ds , successfully positioning mer ##s - co ##v on the landscape of corona ##virus evolution and providing insights into receptor binding by mer ##s - co ##v . furthermore , we found that mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d functions as an effective entry inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v . the identified mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d may also serve as a potential candidate for mer ##s - co ##v subunit vaccines . overall , this study enhance ##s our understanding of the evolution of corona ##virus rb ##ds , provides insights into receptor recognition by mer ##s - co ##v , and may help control the transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in humans .  
bats are known to host viruses closely related to important human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) , such as hc ##ov - 229 ##e , severe - acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . as rna viruses may coe ##vo ##l ##ve with their hosts , we sought to investigate the closest sister taxon to bats , the eu ##lip ##ot ##yp ##hl ##a , and screened european hedge ##hog ##s ( erin ##ace ##us europa ##eus ) from germany for co ##v by nest ##ed reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r . a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus species in a phylogenetic sister relationship to mer ##s - co ##v and clade c bat co ##vs was detected and characterized on the whole - genome level . a total of 58 . 9 % of hedge ##hog fe ##cal specimens were positive for the novel co ##v ( eric ##ov ) at 7 . 9 log ( 10 ) mean rna copies per ml . eric ##ov rna concentrations were higher in the int ##est ##ine than in other solid organs , blood , or urine . detailed analyses of the full hedge ##hog int ##est ##ine showed the highest eric ##ov concentrations in lower gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract specimens , compatible with viral replication in the lower int ##est ##ine and fe ##cal - oral transmission . thirteen of 27 ( 48 . 2 % ) hedge ##hog sera contained non - neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v . the animal origins of this beta ##cor ##ona ##virus clade that includes mer ##s - co ##v may thus include both bat and non ##bat hosts .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that spread worldwide in early 2003 . the cause was determined as a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , sar ##s - associated co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , with a single - stranded , plus - sense rna . to date , no effective specific treatment has been identified . to exploit the possibility of using rna interference as a therapeutic approach to fight the disease , pl ##as ##mi ##d - mediated small interfering rna ##s ( sir ##nas ) were generated to target the sar ##s - co ##v genome . the expression of sir ##nas from two pl ##as ##mi ##ds , which specifically target the viral rna polymer ##ase , effectively blocked the cy ##top ##athic effects of sar ##s - co ##v on ve ##ro cells . these two pl ##as ##mi ##ds also inhibit ##ed viral replication as shown by ti ##ter ass ##ays and by an examination of viral rna and protein levels . thus , our results demonstrated the feasibility of developing sir ##nas as effective anti - sar ##s drugs .  
the spike proteins of corona ##virus ##es are capable of binding to a wide range of cellular targets , which contributes to the broad species tr ##op ##ism of corona ##virus ##es . previous reports have demonstrated that middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) predominantly utilizes dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) for cell entry . however , additional cellular binding targets of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein that may aug ##ment mer ##s - co ##v infection have not been further explored . in the current study , using the virus over ##lay protein binding ass ##ay ( vo ##p ##ba ) , we identified car ##cino ##em ##bry ##onic antigen - related cell ad ##hesion molecule 5 ( ce ##aca ##m ##5 ) as a novel cell surface binding target of mer ##s - co ##v . ce ##aca ##m ##5 co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ated with the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v in both over ##ex ##pressed and end ##ogen ##ous settings . disrupt ##ing the interaction between ce ##aca ##m ##5 and mer ##s - co ##v spike with anti - ce ##aca ##m ##5 antibody , rec ##om ##bina ##nt ce ##aca ##m ##5 protein , or small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) knock ##down of ce ##aca ##m ##5 significantly inhibit ##ed the entry of mer ##s - co ##v . rec ##om ##bina ##nt expression of ce ##aca ##m ##5 did not render non ##per ##missive baby ham ##ster kidney ( b ##h ##k ##21 ) cells susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v infection . instead , ce ##aca ##m ##5 over ##ex ##press ##ion significantly enhanced the attachment of mer ##s - co ##v to the b ##h ##k ##21 cells . more importantly , the entry of mer ##s - co ##v was increased when ce ##aca ##m ##5 was over ##ex ##pressed in per ##missive cells , which suggested that ce ##aca ##m ##5 could facilitate mer ##s - co ##v entry in conjunction with d ##pp ##4 despite not being able to support mer ##s - co ##v entry independently . taken together , the results of our study identified ce ##aca ##m ##5 as a novel cell surface binding target of mer ##s - co ##v that facilitates mer ##s - co ##v infection by aug ##ment ##ing the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface . importance infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is associated with the highest mortality rate among all known human - pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es . currently , there are no approved vaccines or therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v infection . the identification of car ##cino ##em ##bry ##onic antigen - related cell ad ##hesion molecule 5 ( ce ##aca ##m ##5 ) as a novel cell surface binding target of mer
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) can in ##fect humans and multiple species of animals , causing a wide spectrum of diseases . the corona ##virus main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) , which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s , is an attractive target for anti - co ##v drug design . in this study , the crystal structures of infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) m ( pro ) and a severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) m ( pro ) mutant ( h ##41 ##a ) , in complex with an n - terminal auto ##cle ##ava ##ge substrate , were individually determined to el ##uc ##ida ##te the structural flexibility and substrate binding of m ( pro ) . a mono ##meric form of ib ##v m ( pro ) was identified for the first time in co ##v m ( pro ) structures . a comparison of these two structures to other available m ( pro ) structures provides new insights for the design of substrate - based inhibitors targeting co ##v m ( pro ) s . furthermore , a michael accept ##or inhibitor ( named n ##3 ) was co ##cr ##yst ##all ##ized with ib ##v m ( pro ) and was found to demonstrate in vitro ina ##ct ##ivation of ib ##v m ( pro ) and potent anti ##vira ##l activity against ib ##v in chicken embryo ##s . this provides a feasible animal model for designing wide - spectrum inhibitors against co ##v - associated diseases . the structure - based optimization of n ##3 has yielded two more e ##ffi ##ca ##cious lead compounds , n ##27 and h ##16 , with potent inhibition against sar ##s - co ##v m ( pro ) .  
infection of humans with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) results in substantial mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , with death resulting primarily from respiratory failure . while the lungs are the major site of infection , the brain is also infected in some patients . brain infection may result in long - term neurological sequel ##ae , but little is known about the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v in this organ . we previously showed that the brain was a major target organ for infection in mice that are trans ##genic for the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ) . here ##in , we use these mice to show that virus enters the brain primarily via the ol ##factory bulb , and infection results in rapid , trans ##ne ##uron ##al spread to connected areas of the brain . this extensive ne ##uron ##al infection is the main cause of death because intra ##cr ##anial in ##oc ##ulation with low doses of virus results in a uniformly lethal disease even though little infection is detected in the lungs . death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and / or death of infected neurons , especially those located in card ##ior ##es ##pi ##rator ##y centers in the med ##ulla . remarkably , the virus induce ##s minimal cellular in ##filtration in the brain . our results show that neurons are a highly susceptible target for sar ##s - co ##v and that only the absence of the host cell receptor prevents severe mu ##rine brain disease .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel strain of corona ##virus . examination of the immune responses of patients who have recovered from sar ##s should provide important information for design of a safe and effective vaccine . we determined the continuous viral ep ##ito ##pes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients through bio ##pan ##ning with a vast m1 ##3 ph ##age display dod ##eca ##pe ##pt ##ide library . these ep ##ito ##pes converge ##d to very short peptide fragments , one on each of the structural proteins spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins 3a , 9 ##b , and ns ##p 3 . im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys found that most of the patients who had recovered from sar ##s developed complementary antibodies to the ep ##ito ##pe - rich region on the spike s ##2 protein , indicating that this is an im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant site on the viral envelope comprising the spike , matrix , and small envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s . these s ##2 - targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutral ##ize the corona ##virus , indicating that they provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from the viral infection . these results suggest that the sar ##s corona ##virus might have an antigen ##ic profile distinct from those of other human or animal corona ##virus ##es . due to the tested safety and protective effects of the con ##vale ##scent - phase ser ##ological antibodies , identification of their complementary antigen ##s may enable the design of an ep ##ito ##pe - based vaccine to prevent potential antibody - mediated im ##mun ##uo ##path ##ology .  
mann ##ose - binding le ##ct ##in ( mb ##l ) is a serum protein that plays an important role in host defenses as an ops ##oni ##n and through activation of the complement system . the objective of this study was to assess the interactions between mb ##l and severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( sar ##s - s ) . mb ##l was found to selective ##ly bind to retro ##vira ##l particles pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - s . unlike several other viral envelope ##s to which mb ##l can bind , both rec ##om ##bina ##nt and plasma - derived human mb ##l directly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - s - mediated viral infection . moreover , the interaction between mb ##l and sar ##s - s blocked viral binding to the c - type le ##ct ##in , dc - sign . mu ##tage ##nes ##is indicated that a single n - linked g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site , n ##33 ##0 , was critical for the specific interactions between mb ##l and sar ##s - s . despite the proximity of n ##33 ##0 to the receptor - binding motif of sar ##s - s , mb ##l did not affect interactions with the ace ##2 receptor or cat ##he ##ps ##in l - mediated activation of sar ##s - s - driven membrane fusion . thus , binding of mb ##l to sar ##s - s may interfere with other early pre - or post ##re ##ce ##pt ##or - binding events necessary for efficient viral entry .  
since early march 2003 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection has claimed 34 ##6 cases and 37 deaths in taiwan . the epidemic occurred in two stages . the first stage caused limited fa ##mi ##lia ##l or hospital infections and lasted from early march to mid - april . all cases had clear contact histories , primarily from guangdong or hong kong . the second stage resulted in a large outbreak in a municipal hospital , and quickly spread to northern and southern taiwan from late april to mid - june . during this stage , there were some sporadic cases with un ##tra ##cea ##ble contact histories . to investigate the origin and transmission route of sar ##s - co ##v in taiwan ' s epidemic , we conducted a systematic viral lineage study by sequencing the entire viral genome from ten sar ##s patients . sar ##s - co ##v viruses isolated from taiwan were found closely related to those from guangdong and hong kong . in addition , all cases from the second stage belonged to the same lineage after the municipal hospital outbreak , including the patients without an apparent contact history . analyses of these full - length sequences showed a positive selection occurring during sar ##s - co ##v virus evolution . the mis ##mat ##ch distribution indicated that sar ##s viral genome ##s did not reach equilibrium and suggested a recent introduction of the viruses into human populations . the estimated genome mutation rate was ≈ ##0 . 1 per genome , demonstrating possibly one of the lowest rates among known rna viruses .  
the case fatal ##ity was the lowest ( 3 . 8 % ) among 151 ##2 cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in guangdong province , china . rational use of co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid , non - invasive ventilation and the integration of traditional chinese medicine and modern medicine may partly have contributed to the lowest fatal ##ity figure . there was a close link ##age between ci ##vet cats and humans in terms of transmission of sar ##s . strict control of the wild - animal market may be significant in preventing a new outbreak of sar ##s this year .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute respiratory infection with as yet unclear ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . we previously showed that mer ##s - co ##v counter ##act ##s parts of the innate immune response in human bro ##nch ##iol ##ar cells . here we analyzed accessory proteins 3 , 4a , 4 ##b , and 5 for their abilities to inhibit the type i inter ##fer ##on response . accessory protein 4a was found to block inter ##fer ##on induction at the level of mel ##ano ##ma differentiation - associated protein 5 ( md ##a ##5 ) activation presumably by direct interaction with double - stranded rna .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a respiratory disease , caused by a corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , that is characterized by at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n protein ) of sar ##s - co ##v plays an important role in inhibition of type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) production via an unknown mechanism . in this study , the sar ##s - co ##v n protein was found to bind to the sp ##ry domain of the trip ##art ##ite motif protein 25 ( trim ##25 ) e ##3 u ##bi ##qui ##tin liga ##se , thereby interfering with the association between trim ##25 and re ##tino ##ic acid - ind ##ucible gene i ( rig - i ) and inhibit ##ing trim ##25 - mediated rig - i u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion and activation . type i if ##n production induced by poly i · c or send ##ai virus ( se ##v ) was suppressed by the sar ##s - co ##v n protein . sar ##s - co ##v replication was increased by over ##ex ##press ##ion of the full - length n protein but not n amino acids 1 to 36 ##1 , which could not interact with trim ##25 . these findings provide an insight ##ful interpretation of the sar ##s - co ##v - mediated host innate immune suppression caused by the n protein . importance the sar ##s - co ##v n protein is essential for the viral life cycle and plays a key role in the virus - host interaction . we demonstrated that the interaction between the c terminus of the n protein and the sp ##ry domain of trim ##25 inhibit ##ed trim ##25 - mediated rig - i u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion , which resulted in the inhibition of if ##n production . we also found that the middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) n protein interact ##ed with trim ##25 and inhibit ##ed rig - i signaling . the outcomes of these findings indicate the function of the corona ##virus n protein in mod ##ulating the host ' s initial innate immune response .  
replication of viruses in species other than their natural hosts is frequently limited by entry and post ##ent ##ry barriers . the corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) utilizes the receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) to in ##fect cells . here we compare human , mouse , and rat ace ##2 molecules for their ability to serve as receptors for sar ##s - co ##v . we found that , compared to human ace ##2 , mu ##rine ace ##2 less efficiently bound the s ##1 domain of sar ##s - co ##v and supported less - efficient s protein - mediated infection . rat ace ##2 was even less efficient , at near background levels for both activities . mu ##rine 3 ##t ##3 cells expressing human ace ##2 supported sar ##s - co ##v replication , whereas replication was less than 10 % as efficient in the same cells expressing mu ##rine ace ##2 . these data imply that a mouse trans ##genic ##ally expressing human ace ##2 may be a useful animal model of sar ##s .  
the spike ( s ) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) can be pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally activated by cat ##he ##ps ##ins b and l upon viral up ##take into target cell end ##oso ##mes . in contrast , it is largely unknown whether host cell pro ##tea ##ses located in the secret ##ory pathway of infected cells and / or on the surface of target cells can cl ##ea ##ve sar ##s s . we along with others could previously show that the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activate ##s the influenza virus hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin and the human meta ##p ##ne ##um ##ov ##irus f protein by cleavage . here , we assessed whether sar ##s s is pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally processed by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . western b ##lot analysis revealed that sar ##s s was cl ##ea ##ved into several fragments upon coe ##x ##press ##ion of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ( cis - cleavage ) and upon contact between sar ##s s - expressing cells and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - positive cells ( trans - cleavage ) . cis - cleavage resulted in release of sar ##s s fragments into the cellular super ##nat ##ant and in inhibition of antibody - mediated neutral ##ization , most likely because sar ##s s fragments function as antibody deco ##ys . trans - cleavage activated sar ##s s on effect ##or cells for fusion with target cells and allowed efficient sar ##s s - driven viral entry into targets treated with a l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic agent or a cat ##he ##ps ##in inhibitor . finally , ace ##2 , the cellular receptor for sar ##s - co ##v , and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 were found to be coe ##x ##pressed by type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , which represent important viral target cells , suggesting that sar ##s s is cl ##ea ##ved by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 in the lung of sar ##s - co ##v - infected individuals . in summary , we show that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 might promote viral spread and pathogen ##esis by dim ##ini ##shing viral recognition by neutral ##izing antibodies and by act ##ivating sar ##s s for cell - cell and virus - cell fusion .  
the shed ##ding of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) into saliva droplets plays a critical role in viral transmission . the source of high viral loads in saliva , however , remains elusive . here we investigate the early target cells of infection in the entire array of respiratory tissues in chinese mac ##aq ##ues after intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation ##s with a single - cycle pseudo ##type ##d virus and a pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v . we found that ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 - positive ( ace ##2 ( + ) ) cells were widely distributed in the upper respiratory tract , and ace ##2 ( + ) ep ##ith ##elial cells lining saliva ##ry gland duct ##s were the early target cells productive ##ly infected . our findings also have implications for sar ##s - co ##v early diagnosis and prevention .  
viruses of the family corona ##vir ##idae have recently emerged through zoo ##not ##ic transmission to become serious human pathogen ##s . the pathogen ##ic agent responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is a member of this large family of positive - strand rna viruses that cause a spectrum of disease in humans , other mammals , and birds . since the publicized outbreak ##s of sar ##s in china and canada in 2002 - 2003 , significant efforts successfully identified the ca ##usa ##tive agent , host cell receptor ( s ) , and many of the pathogen ##ic mechanisms underlying sar ##s . with this greater understanding of sar ##s - co ##v biology , many researchers have sought to identify agents for the treatment of sar ##s . here we report the utility of the potent anti ##vira ##l protein griffiths ##in ( gr ##ft ) in the prevention of sar ##s - co ##v infection both in vitro and in vivo . we also show that gr ##ft specifically binds to the sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and inhibit ##s viral entry . in addition , we report the activity of gr ##ft against a variety of additional corona ##virus ##es that in ##fect humans , other mammals , and birds . finally , we show that gr ##ft treatment has a positive effect on mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in a lethal infection model using a mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v and also specifically inhibit ##s del ##eter ##ious aspects of the host im ##mun ##ological response to sar ##s infection in mammals .  
the use of rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) - based antibody and antigen tests for diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v infections have been widely reported . however , no rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v spike protein ( s ) - based elisa is currently available . in this article , we describe the problems and solutions of setting up the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v s - based elisa for antibody detection . the sar ##s - co ##v s - based im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin m ( i ##gm ) and i ##gg elisa ##s were evaluated and compared with the corresponding n - based elisa for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia , using sera from 148 healthy blood donors who donated blood 3 years ago as controls and 95 sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia patients in hong kong . results obtained by the rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ( rs ) - based i ##gg elisa using the reg ##ener ##ated s prepared by dial ##ysis with decreasing concentrations of ur ##ea or direct addition of different coating buffer ##s , followed by addition of different regeneration buffer , identified 4 m ur ##ea and 1 m sar ##cos ##ine for plate coating and no regeneration buffer as the most optimal conditions for antibody detection . the specific ##ities of the s - based elisa for i ##gg and i ##gm detection were 98 . 6 % and 93 . 9 % , with corresponding sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 58 . 9 % and 74 . 7 % , respectively . the sensitivity of the rn i ##gg elisa ( 94 . 7 % ) is significantly higher than that of the rs i ##gg elisa ( p < 0 . 001 ) , whereas the sensitivity of the rs i ##gm elisa is significantly higher than that of the rn i ##gm elisa ( 55 . 2 % ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) . an elisa for detection of i ##gm against s and n could be more sensitive than one that detect ##s i ##gm against n alone for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) presents a novel emerging threat to public health worldwide . several treatments for infected individuals have been suggested including if ##n , rib ##avi ##rin and passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py with con ##vale ##scent plasma . administration of if ##n - α ##2 ##b and rib ##avi ##rin has improved outcomes of mer ##s - co ##v infection in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues when administered within 8 h post - challenge . however , detailed and systematic evidence on the activity of other clinical ##ly available drugs is limited . here we compared the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of mer ##s - co ##v with different if ##n products ( if ##n - α ##2 ##b , if ##n - γ , if ##n - universal , if ##n - α ##2 ##a and if ##n - β ) , as well as with two anti ##vira ##ls , rib ##avi ##rin and my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid ( mp ##a ) , against mer ##s - co ##v ( hu / jordan - n ##3 / 2012 ) in vitro . of all the if ##ns tested , if ##n - β showed the strong ##st inhibition of mer ##s - co ##v in vitro , with an ic ( 50 ) of 1 . 37 u ml ( − ##1 ) , 41 times lower than the previously reported ic ( 50 ) ( 56 . 08 u ml ( − ##1 ) ) of if ##n - α ##2 ##b . if ##n - β inhibition was confirmed in the virus yield reduction ass ##ay , with an ic ( 90 ) of 38 . 8 u ml ( − ##1 ) . rib ##avi ##rin did not inhibit viral replication in vitro at a dose that would be applicable to current treatment protocols in humans . in contrast , mp ##a showed strong inhibition , with an ic ( 50 ) of 2 . 87 µ ##m . this drug has not been previously tested against mer ##s - co ##v and may provide an alternative to rib ##avi ##rin for treatment of mer ##s - co ##v . in conclusion , if ##n - β , mp ##a or a combination of the two may be beneficial in the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v or as a post - exposure intervention in high - risk patients with known exposure ##s to mer ##s - co ##v .  
to identify host factors relevant for severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication , we performed a small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) library screen targeting the human kin ##ome . protein kinase ##s are key regulators of many cellular functions , and the systematic knock ##down of their expression should provide a broad perspective on factors and pathways promoting or ant ##ago ##ni ##zing corona ##virus replication . in addition to 40 proteins that promote sar ##s - co ##v replication , our study identified 90 factors exhibiting an anti ##vira ##l effect . pathway analysis grouped subset ##s of these factors in specific cellular processes , including the innate immune response and the metabolism of complex lip ##ids , which appear to play a role in sar ##s - co ##v infection . several factors were selected for in - depth validation in follow - up experiments . in cells depleted for the β ##2 subunit of the coat ##ome ##r protein complex ( cop ##b ##2 ) , the strongest pro ##vira ##l hit , we observed reduced sar ##s - co ##v protein expression and a > 2 - log reduction in virus yield . knock ##down of the cop ##b ##2 - related proteins cop ##b ##1 and go ##l ##gi - specific br ##efe ##ld ##in a - resistant gu ##ani ##ne nu ##cle ##otide exchange factor 1 ( gb ##f ##1 ) also suggested that cop ##i - coated ve ##sic ##les and / or the early secret ##ory pathway are important for sar ##s - co ##v replication . de ##ple ##tion of the anti ##vira ##l double - stranded rna - activated protein kinase ( p ##kr ) enhanced virus replication in the primary screen , and validation experiments confirmed increased sar ##s - co ##v protein expression and virus production upon p ##kr de ##ple ##tion . in addition , cy ##cl ##in - dependent kinase 6 ( cd ##k ##6 ) was identified as a novel anti ##vira ##l host factor in sar ##s - co ##v replication . the inventory of pro - and anti ##vira ##l host factors and pathways described here sub ##stan ##tia ##tes and expands our understanding of sar ##s - co ##v replication and may contribute to the identification of novel targets for anti ##vira ##l therapy . importance replication of all viruses , including sar ##s - co ##v , depends on and is influenced by cellular pathways . although substantial progress has been made in di ##sse ##cting the corona ##virus replica ##tive cycle , our understanding of the host factors that stimulate ( pro ##vira ##l factors ) or restrict ( anti ##vira ##l factors ) infection remains far from complete . to study the role of host proteins in sar ##s - co ##v infection , we set out to systematically identify kinase - regulated processes that influence virus replication . protein kinase ##s are key regulators in signal trans ##duction
we examined severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) rna in plasma of 32 patients ( probable sar ##s cases ) by a quantitative real - time reverse transcription - pc ##r ass ##ay and reported that the highest detection rate , 75 % , was found between day 5 and day 7 of illness , followed by rates of 64 , 50 , and 38 % found between day 8 and day 11 , day 2 and day 4 , and day 12 and day 16 , respectively . analysis of sequential sar ##s - co ##v load in plasma from six cases revealed different patterns of vi ##rem ##ia , with the peak between day 4 and day 8 . our findings of the high detection rate of sar ##s - co ##v rna in plasma before day 11 , together with the relative convenience of collecting and handling plasma , suggest that plasma can be used for early diagnosis of sar ##s .  
ni ##tric oxide ( no ) is an important signaling molecule between cells which has been shown to have an inhibitor ##y effect on some virus infections . the purpose of this study was to examine whether no inhibit ##s the replication cycle of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) in vitro . we found that an organic no donor , s - ni ##tro ##so - n - ace ##ty ##lp ##eni ##ci ##lla ##mine , significantly inhibit ##ed the replication cycle of sar ##s co ##v in a concentration - dependent manner . we also show here that no inhibit ##s viral protein and rna synthesis . furthermore , we demonstrate that no generated by ind ##ucible ni ##tric oxide synth ##ase , an enzyme that produces no , inhibit ##s the sar ##s co ##v replication cycle .  
ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is a receptor for sar ##s - co ##v , the novel corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome [ li , w . moore , m . j . , va ##sil ##ie ##va , n . , sui , j . , wong , s . k . , bern ##e , m . a . , so ##mas ##unda ##ran , m . , sullivan , j . l . , luz ##uria ##ga , k . , green ##ough , t . c . , et al . ( 2003 ) nature 42 ##6 , 450 – 45 ##4 ] . we have identified a different human cellular g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that can serve as an alternative receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . a human lung cd ##na library in ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus g pseudo ##type ##d retro ##virus was trans ##duced into chinese ham ##ster o ##vary cells , and the cells were sorted for binding of soluble sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , s ( 590 ) and s ( 118 ##0 ) . clones of trans ##duced cells that bound sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein were in ##oc ##ulated with sar ##s - co ##v , and increases in sub ##gen ##omic viral rna from 1 – 16 h or more were detected by multiple ##x rt - pc ##r in four clone ##d cell lines . sequencing of the human lung cd ##na insert ##s showed that each of the clone ##d cell lines contained cd ##na that encoded human cd ##20 ##9 ##l , a c - type le ##ct ##in ( also called l - sign ) . when the cd ##na encoding cd ##20 ##9 ##l from clone 2 . 27 was clone ##d and trans ##fect ##ed into chinese ham ##ster o ##vary cells , the cells expressed human cd ##20 ##9 ##l g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and became susceptible to infection with sar ##s - co ##v . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry showed that cd ##20 ##9 ##l is expressed in human lung in type ii al ##ve ##olar cells and end ##oth ##elial cells , both potential targets for sar ##s - co ##v . several other enveloped viruses including e ##bola and sin ##db ##is also use cd ##20 ##9 ##l as a portal of entry , and hiv and hepatitis c virus can bind to cd ##20 ##9 ##l on cell membranes but do not use it to media ##te virus entry . our data suggest that the large s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v may use both ace ##2 and cd ##20 ##9 ##l in virus infection and pathogen ##esis .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute respiratory tract disease characterized by diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage and h ##yal ##ine membrane formation . this pathology often progresses to acute respiratory distress ( such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [ ar ##ds ] ) and at ##yp ##ical pneumonia in humans , with characteristic age - related mortality rates approaching 50 % or more in im ##mun ##ose ##nes ##cent populations . the molecular basis for the extreme vi ##ru ##lence of sar ##s - co ##v remains elusive . since young and aged ( 1 - year - old ) mice do not develop severe clinical disease following infection with wild - type sar ##s - co ##v , a mouse - adapted strain of sar ##s - co ##v ( called ma ##15 ) was developed and was shown to cause lethal infection in these animals . to understand the genetic contributions to the increased pathogen ##esis of ma ##15 in rodents , we used reverse genetics and evaluated the vi ##ru ##lence of panels of derivative viruses encoding various combinations of mouse - adapted mutations . we found that mutations in the viral spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and , to a much less rigorous extent , in the ns ##p ##9 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein , were primarily associated with the acquisition of vi ##ru ##lence in young animals . the mutations in s likely increase recognition of the mouse ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor not only in ma ##15 but also in two additional , independently isolated mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##vs . in contrast to the findings for young animals , mutations to rev ##ert to the wild - type sequence in ns ##p ##9 and the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein were not sufficient to significantly at ##ten ##uate the virus compared to other combinations of mouse - adapted mutations in 12 - month - old mice . this panel of sar ##s - co ##vs provides novel re ##age ##nts that we have used to further our understanding of differential , age - related pathogen ##ic mechanisms in mouse models of human disease .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is known to take an end ##osomal pathway for cell entry ; however , it is thought to enter directly from the cell surface when a receptor - bound vi ##rion spike ( s ) protein is affected by try ##ps ##in , which induce ##s cleavage of the s protein and activate ##s its fusion potential . this suggests that sar ##s - co ##v bearing a cl ##ea ##ved form of the s protein can enter cells directly from the cell surface without try ##ps ##in treatment . to explore this possibility , we introduced a fur ##in - like cleavage sequence in the s protein at amino acids 79 ##8 to 80 ##1 and found that the mu ##tated s protein was cl ##ea ##ved and induced cell fusion without try ##ps ##in treatment when expressed on the cell surface . furthermore , a pseudo ##type virus bearing a cl ##ea ##ved s protein was revealed to in ##fect cells in the presence of a l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic agent as well as a pro ##tea ##se inhibitor , both of which are known to block sar ##s - co ##v infection via an end ##oso ##me , whereas the infection of pseudo ##type ##s with an uncle ##ave ##d , wild - type s protein was blocked by these agents . a he ##pta ##d repeat peptide , derived from a sar ##s - co ##v s protein that is known to efficiently block infections from the cell surface , blocked the infection by a pseudo ##type with a cl ##ea ##ved s protein but not that with an uncle ##ave ##d s protein . those results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v with a cl ##ea ##ved s protein is able to enter cells directly from the cell surface and agree with the previous observation of the pro ##tea ##se - mediated cell surface entry of sar ##s - co ##v .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) uses den ##dr ##itic cell - specific ic ##am - 3 grabbing non ##int ##eg ##rin ( dc - sign ) to facilitate cell entry via cellular receptor - ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 . for this project , we used rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus ##es expressing different lengths of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein in a capture ass ##ay to de ##du ##ce the minimal dc - sign binding region . our results identified the region location between amino acid ( aa ) residues 324 to 38 ##6 of the s protein . we then generated nine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against the s protein to map the dc - sign - binding domain using capture ass ##ays with pseudo ##type ##d viruses and observed that mab si ##a ##5 significantly blocked s protein - dc - sign interaction . an enhancement ass ##ay using the hk ##u ##39 ##8 ##49 sar ##s - co ##v strain and human immature den ##dr ##itic cells confirmed our observation . data from a pep ##scan analysis and m1 ##3 ph ##age peptide display library system mapped the reactive mab si ##a ##5 ep ##ito ##pe to aa residues 36 ##3 to 36 ##8 of the s protein . results from a capture ass ##ay testing three pseudo ##type ##d viruses with mu ##tated n - linked g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites of the s protein indicate that only two pseudo ##type ##d viruses ( n ##33 ##0 ##q and n ##35 ##7 ##q , both of which lost g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites near the si ##a ##5 ep ##ito ##pe ) had diminished dc - sign - binding capacity . we also noted that mab si ##b ##4 ex ##erted a neutral ##izing effect against hk ##u ##39 ##8 ##49 ; its reactive ep ##ito ##pe was mapped to aa residues 435 to 43 ##9 of the s protein . we offer the data to facilitate the development of therapeutic agents and prevent ##ive vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 , caused by a zoo ##not ##ically transmitted corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . over 1 , 900 cases have been reported to date , with [UNK] % fatal ##ity rate . lack of auto ##ps ##ies from mer ##s cases has hind ##ered understanding of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis . a small animal model that develops progressive pulmonary manifestation ##s when infected with mer ##s - co ##v would advance the field . as mice are restricted to infection at the level of d ##pp ##4 , the mer ##s - co ##v receptor , we generated mice with human ##ized ex ##ons 10 – 12 of the mouse d ##pp ##4 locus . upon in ##oc ##ulation with mer ##s - co ##v , human d ##pp ##4 knock ##in ( ki ) mice supported virus replication in the lungs , but developed no illness . after 30 serial passages through the lungs of ki mice , a mouse - adapted virus emerged ( mer ##s ( ma ) ) that grew in lungs to over 100 times higher ti ##ters than the starting virus . a plaque - pu ##rified mer ##s ( ma ) clone caused weight loss and fatal infection . virus antigen was observed in air ##way ep ##ith ##elia , p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , and macro ##pha ##ges . path ##olo ##gic findings included diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage with pulmonary ed ##ema and h ##yal ##ine membrane formation associated with accumulation of activated inflammatory mono ##cy ##te – macro ##pha ##ges and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s in the lungs . relative to the parental mer ##s - co ##v , mer ##s ( ma ) viruses contained 13 – 22 mutations , including several within the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gene . s - protein mutations sen ##sit ##ized viruses to entry - act ##ivating ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses and conferred more rapid entry kinetic ##s . rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s ( ma ) bearing mutant s proteins were more vi ##ru ##lent than the parental virus in hd ##pp ##4 ki mice . the hd ##pp ##4 ki mouse and the mer ##s ( ma ) provide tools to investigate disease causes and develop new the ##ra ##pies .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s , a fatal pulmonary disorder with no effective treatment . we found that sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s protein ) , a key molecule for viral entry , binds to cal ##ne ##xin , a molecular cha ##per ##one in the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) , but not to cal ##ret ##ic ##ulin , a homo ##log of cal ##ne ##xin . cal ##ne ##xin bound to most truncated mutants of s protein , and s protein bound to all mutants of cal ##ne ##xin . pseudo ##type ##d virus carrying s protein ( s - pseudo ##virus ) produced by human cells that were treated with small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) for cal ##ne ##xin expression ( cal ##ne ##xin sir ##na - treated cells ) showed significantly lower in ##fect ##ivity than s - pseudo ##virus ##es produced by un ##tre ##ated and control sir ##na - treated cells . s - pseudo ##virus produced by cal ##ne ##xin sir ##na - treated cells contained s protein modified with n - g ##ly ##can side chains differently from other two s proteins and consisted of two kinds of viral particles : those of normal density with little s protein and those of high density with abundant s protein . treatment with peptide - n - g ##ly ##cos ##ida ##se f ( p ##nga ##se f ) , which removes all types of n - g ##ly ##can side chains from g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , eliminated the in ##fect ##ivity of s - pseudo ##virus . s - pseudo ##virus and sar ##s - co ##v produced in the presence of α - g ##lu ##cos ##ida ##se inhibitors , which disrupt the interaction between cal ##ne ##xin and its substrates , showed significantly lower in ##fect ##ivity than each virus produced in the absence of those compounds . in s - pseudo ##virus , the incorporation of s protein into viral particles was obviously inhibit ##ed . in sar ##s - co ##v , viral production was obviously inhibit ##ed . these findings demonstrated that cal ##ne ##xin strictly monitors the mat ##uration of s protein by its direct binding , resulting in con ##fer ##ring in ##fect ##ivity on sar ##s - co ##v .  
prevalence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was determined in 45 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from two geographically separated herds in jordan . virus shed ##ding was only detected in sw ##ab ##s obtained from the respiratory tract and primarily observed in camel ##s younger than 3 years . mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce increased with age of camel ##s . bo ##vine and sheep sera were ser ##one ##gative . phylogenetic analysis of partial s ##2 clustered the jordanian mer ##s - co ##v strains with contemporary mer ##s - co ##v strains associated with nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s .  
five mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - causing corona ##virus ( co ##v ) were developed by hybrid ##oma technology . ep ##ito ##pe mapping by western b ##lot ##ting showed that these anti - sar ##s - co ##v np mab ##s bind to distinct domains of np . these anti - sar ##s - co ##v np mab ##s , with their high specific ##ity , are potentially ideal candidates for developing early and sensitive diagnostic ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in early 2003 to cause a very severe acute respiratory syndrome , which eventually resulted in a 10 % case - fatal ##ity rate . owing to excellent public health measures that isolated focus cases and their contacts , and the use of supportive the ##ra ##pies , the epidemic was suppressed to the point that further cases have not appeared since 2005 . however , despite intensive research since then ( over 350 ##0 publications ) , it remains an un ##tre ##atable disease . the potential for re - emergence of the sar ##s - co ##v or a similar virus with unknown but potentially serious consequences remains high . this is due in part to the extreme genetic variability of rna viruses such as the corona ##virus ##es , the many animal reservoirs that seem to be able host the sar ##s - co ##v in which re ##ass ##ort ##ment or rec ##om ##bina ##tion events could occur and the ability corona ##virus ##es have to transmit relatively rapidly from species to species in a short period of time . thus , it seems pr ##ude ##nt to continue to explore and develop anti ##vira ##l che ##mot ##her ##ap ##ies to treat sar ##s - co ##v infections . to this end , the various e ##ffi ##ca ##cious anti - sar ##s - co ##v the ##ra ##pies recently published from 2007 to 2010 are reviewed in this article . in addition , compounds that have been tested in various animal models and were found to reduce virus lung ti ##ters and / or were protective against death in lethal models of disease , or otherwise have been shown to am ##eli ##ora ##te the effects of viral infection , are also reported .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in the middle east since 2012 has caused more than 900 human infections with [UNK] % mortality to date . animal models are needed for studying pathogen ##esis and for development of prevent ##ive and therapeutic agents against mer ##s - co ##v infection . non ##hum ##an primate ##s ( r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues and mar ##mos ##ets ) are expensive models of limited availability . although a mouse lung infection model has been described using aden ##ov ##irus vectors expressing human cd ##26 / dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , it is believed that a trans ##genic mouse model is needed for mer ##s - co ##v research . we have developed this trans ##genic mouse model as indicated in this study . we show that trans ##genic mice globally expressing hc ##d ##26 / d ##pp ##4 were fully per ##missive to mer ##s - co ##v infection , resulting in relentless weight loss and death within days post ##in ##fect ##ion . high infectious virus ti ##ters were recovered primarily from the lungs and brains of mice at 2 and 4 days post ##in ##fect ##ion , respectively , whereas viral rna ##s were also detected in the heart , sp ##leen , and int ##est ##ine , indicating a di ##sse ##minating viral infection . infected t ##g ( + ) mice developed a progressive pneumonia , characterized by extensive inflammatory in ##filtration . in contrast , an inconsistent mild per ##iva ##scu ##lar cuff ##ing was the only path ##ological change associated with the infected brains . moreover , infected t ##g ( + ) mice were able to activate genes encoding for many anti ##vira ##l and inflammatory media ##tors within the lungs and brains , coin ##ci ##ding with the high levels of viral replication . this new and unique trans ##genic mouse model will be useful for further ##ing knowledge of mer ##s pathogen ##esis and for the development of vaccine and treatments against mer ##s - co ##v infection . importance small and economical animal models are required for the controlled and extensive studies needed for el ##uc ##ida ##ting pathogen ##esis and development of vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls against mer ##s . mice are the most desirable small - animal species for this purpose because of availability and the existence of a thorough knowledge base , particularly of genetics and im ##mun ##ology . the standard small animals , mice , ham ##sters , and fe ##rret ##s , all lack the functional mer ##s - co ##v receptor and are not susceptible to infection . so , initial studies were done with non ##hum ##an primate ##s , expensive models of limited availability . a mouse lung infection model was described where a mouse aden ##ov ##irus was used to trans ##fect lung cells for receptor expression . nevertheless ,
l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and increasing viral load in the first 10 days of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) suggested immune eva ##sion by sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . in this study , we focused on den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) which play important roles in linking the innate and adaptive immunity . sar ##s - co ##v was shown to in ##fect both immature and mature human mono ##cy ##te - derived dc ##s by electron microscopy and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence . the detection of negative strands of sar ##s - co ##v rna in dc ##s suggested viral replication . however , no increase in viral rna was observed . using cy ##top ##athic ass ##ays , no increase in virus ti ##ter was detected in infected dc ##s and cell - culture super ##nat ##ant , confirming that virus replication was incomplete . no induction of ap ##op ##tosis or mat ##uration was detected in sar ##s - co ##v – infected dc ##s . the sar ##s - co ##v – infected dc ##s showed low expression of anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ines ( inter ##fer ##on α [ if ##n - α ] , if ##n - β , if ##n - γ , and inter ##le ##uki ##n 12 ##p ##40 [ il - 12 ##p ##40 ] ) , moderate up - regulation of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines ( tumor nec ##rosis factor α [ tn ##f - α ] and il - 6 ) but significant up - regulation of inflammatory che ##mo ##kin ##es ( macro ##pha ##ge inflammatory protein 1 ##α [ mi ##p - 1 ##α ] , regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secret ##ed [ ran ##tes ] ) , inter ##fer ##on - ind ##ucible protein of 10 k ##da [ ip - 10 ] , and mono ##cy ##te che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t protein 1 [ mc ##p - 1 ] ) . the lack of anti ##vira ##l cy ##tok ##ine response against a background of intense che ##mo ##kin ##e up - regulation could represent a mechanism of immune eva ##sion by sar ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a high - priority pathogen in pan ##de ##mic prepared ##ness research . reverse genetics systems are a valuable tool to study viral replication and pathogen ##esis , design at ##ten ##uated vaccines and create defined viral ass ##ay systems for applications such as anti ##vira ##l screening . here we present a novel reverse genetics system for mer ##s - co ##v that involves maintenance of the full - length viral genome as a cd ##na copy inserted in a bacterial artificial chromosome am ##ena ##ble to manipulation by homo ##logue rec ##om ##bina ##tion , based on the ba ##cter ##io ##pha ##ge λ red rec ##om ##bina ##tion system . based on a full - length infectious mer ##s - co ##v cd ##na clone , optimal gen ##omic insertion sites and expression strategies for g ##fp were identified and used to generate a reporter mer ##s - co ##v expressing g ##fp in addition to the complete set of viral proteins . g ##fp was genetically fused to the n - terminal part of protein 4a , from which it is released during translation via por ##cine te ##sch ##ov ##irus 2a peptide activity . the resulting reporter virus achieved ti ##tres nearly identical to the wild - type virus 48 h after infection of ve ##ro cells at m . o . i . 0 . 001 ( 1 ##× ##10 ( 5 ) p . f . u . ml ( − ##1 ) and 3 ##× ##10 ( 5 ) p . f . u . ml ( − ##1 ) , respectively ) , and allowed determination of the 50 % inhibitor ##y concentration for the known mer ##s - co ##v inhibitor cy ##cl ##os ##por ##ine a based on flu ##orescence read ##out . the resulting value was 2 . 41 µ ##m , which corresponds to values based on wild - type virus . the reverse genetics system described here ##in can be efficiently mu ##tated by red - mediated rec ##om ##bina ##tion . the g ##fp - expressing reporter virus contains the full set of mer ##s - co ##v proteins and achieve ##s wild - type ti ##tres in cell culture .  
public health measures successfully contained outbreak ##s of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . however , the precursor of the sar ##s - co ##v remains in its natural bat reservoir , and re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of a human - adapted sar ##s - like corona ##virus remains a plausible public health concern . va ##cci ##nation is a major strategy for containing resurgence of sar ##s in humans , and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models . we previously reported that antibody eli ##cite ##d by a sar ##s - co ##v vaccine candidate based on rec ##om ##bina ##nt full - length spike - protein trim ##ers potent ##iated infection of human b cell lines despite eli ##cit ##ing in vivo a neutral ##izing and protective immune response in rodents . these observations prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) of sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . we demonstrate here that anti - spike immune serum , while inhibit ##ing viral entry in a per ##missive cell line , potent ##iated infection of immune cells by sar ##s - co ##v spike - pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles , as well as replication - competent sar ##s corona ##virus . antibody - mediated infection was dependent on fc ##γ receptor ii but did not use the end ##osomal / l ##ys ##osomal pathway utilized by ang ##iot ##ens ##in i converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the accepted receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . this suggests that ad ##e of sar ##s - co ##v utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells . different sar ##s vaccine candidates eli ##cit sera that differ in their capacity to induce ad ##e in immune cells despite their comparable pot ##ency to neutral ##ize infection in ace ##2 - bearing cells . our results suggest a novel mechanism by which sar ##s - co ##v can enter target cells and illustrate the potential pit ##falls associated with im ##mun ##ization against it . these findings should prompt further investigations into sar ##s pathogen ##esis .  
spike ( s ) proteins , the defining projections of the enveloped corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , media ##te cell entry by connecting viruses to plasma membrane receptors and by cat ##aly ##zing subsequent virus - cell membrane fusion ##s . the latter membrane fusion requires an s protein conform ##ation ##al flexibility that is facilitated by pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage ##s . we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that the most relevant cellular pro ##tea ##ses in this process are those closely linked to host cell receptors . the primary receptor for the human severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s ) co ##v is ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . ace ##2 im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation captured trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se / ser ##ine subfamily member 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) , a known human air ##way and al ##ve ##olar pro ##tea ##se . ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 col ##oca ##lized on cell surfaces and enhanced the cell entry of both sar ##s s - pseudo ##type ##d hiv and authentic sar ##s - co ##v . enhanced entry correlated with t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - mediated pro ##te ##ol ##ysis of both s and ace ##2 . these findings indicate that a cell surface complex comprising a primary receptor and a separate end ##op ##rot ##ease operates as a portal for activation of sar ##s - co ##v cell entry .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel infectious disease caused by the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . there are four major structural proteins in the sar ##s - co ##v , including the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , spike , membrane , and small envelope proteins . in this study , two sets of truncated fragments of spike protein were generated , the first were approximately 210 - bp non ##over ##la ##pping fragments and the second were overlapping segments of 750 to 900 bp . from these 23 fragments , we identified a fragment of 259 amino acids ( amino acids 441 to 700 ) that is a major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pe . this fragment was highly expressed , and the pu ##rified fragment c could detect all 33 sar ##s patient serum samples tested , collected from 7 to 60 days after the onset of fever , but had no react ##ivity with all 66 healthy human serum samples tested . thus , fragment c of spike protein was identified as an im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant antigen and could be used for ser ##ological detection of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
here we analyzed the gene expression profile of cells that stab ##ly express the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 3a protein to determine its effects on host functions . a lung ep ##ith ##elial cell - line , a ##54 ##9 , was chosen for this study because the lung is the primary organ infected by sar ##s - co ##v and fatalities resulted mainly from pulmonary complications . our results showed that the expression of 3a up - regulates the mrna levels of all three subunit ##s , a ##α , b ##β , and γ , of fi ##bri ##no ##gen . consequently , the intra ##cellular levels as well as the secret ##ion of fi ##bri ##no ##gen were increased . we also observed increased fi ##bri ##no ##gen levels in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells .  
the emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the arabian peninsula . the evolutionary origins of mer ##s - co ##v are unknown . we determined the full genome sequence of a co ##v directly from fe ##cal material obtained from a south african neo ##rom ##icia cape ##nsis bat ( neo ##co ##v ) . neo ##co ##v shared essential details of genome architecture with mer ##s - co ##v . eighty - five percent of the neo ##co ##v genome was identical to mer ##s - co ##v at the nu ##cle ##otide level . based on taxonomic criteria , neo ##co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v belonged to one viral species . the presence of a genetically diver ##gent s ##1 subunit within the neo ##co ##v spike gene indicated that intra ##sp ##ike rec ##om ##bina ##tion events may have been involved in the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v . neo ##co ##v constitutes a sister taxon of mer ##s - co ##v , placing the mer ##s - co ##v root between a recently described virus from african camel ##s and all other viruses . this suggests a higher level of viral diversity in camel ##s than in humans . together with ser ##olo ##gic evidence for widespread mer ##s - co ##v infection in camel ##ids sampled up to 20 years ago in africa and the arabian peninsula , the genetic data indicate that camel ##s act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa . the majority of camel ##s on the arabian peninsula is imported from the greater horn of africa , where several neo ##rom ##icia species occur . the acquisition of mer ##s - co ##v by camel ##s from bats might have taken place in sub - saharan africa . camel ##ids may represent mixing vessels for mer ##s - co ##v and other mammalian co ##vs . importance it is unclear how , when , and where the highly pathogen ##ic mer ##s - co ##v emerged . we characterized the full genome of an african bat virus closely related to mer ##s - co ##v and show that human , camel , and bat viruses belong to the same viral species . the bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of mer ##s - co ##v , providing evidence for an evolution of mer ##s - co ##v in camel ##s that preceded that in humans . the revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camel ##s rather than vice versa . although mer ##s - co ##v cases occur mainly on the arabian peninsula , the data from this study together with ser ##olo ##gic and molecular investigations of african camel ##s indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in africa . the emergence of mer ##s - co ##v likely involved exchanges of genetic elements between different viral ancestors . these exchanges
to understand how middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) transmitted from bats to humans , we compared the virus surface spikes of mer ##s - co ##v and a related bat corona ##virus , hk ##u ##4 . although hk ##u ##4 spike cannot media ##te viral entry into human cells , two mutations enabled it to do so by allowing it to be activated by human pro ##tea ##ses . these mutations are present in mer ##s - co ##v spike , explaining why mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##s human cells . these mutations therefore played critical roles in the bat - to - human transmission of mer ##s - co ##v , either directly or through intermediate hosts .  
a unique corona ##virus severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was revealed to be a ca ##usa ##tive agent of a life - threatening sar ##s . although this virus grows in a variety of tissues that express its receptor , the mechanism of the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is not well understood . here , we report a possible mechanism for the extensive damage seen in the major target organs for this disease . a recent study of the cell entry mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v reveals that it takes an end ##osomal pathway . we found that pro ##tea ##ses such as try ##ps ##in and the ##rm ##ol ##ys ##in enabled sar ##s - co ##v ads ##or ##bed onto the cell surface to enter cells directly from that site . this finding shows that sar ##s - co ##v has the potential to take two distinct pathways for cell entry , depending on the presence of pro ##tea ##ses in the environment . moreover , the pro ##tea ##se - mediated entry facilitated a 100 - to 1 , 000 - fold higher efficient infection than did the end ##osomal pathway used in the absence of pro ##tea ##ses . these results suggest that the pro ##tea ##ses produced in the lungs by inflammatory cells are responsible for high multiplication of sar ##s - co ##v , which results in severe lung tissue damage . likewise , el ##ast ##ase , a major pro ##tea ##se produced in the lungs during inflammation , also enhanced sar ##s - co ##v infection in culture ##d cells .  
objective : this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##vir ##s ( mer ##s - co ##v ) surveillance protocol in the emergency department ( ed ) at ham ##ad general hospital . effectiveness was measured by : ( a ) reduction in the number of patients admitted into the mer ##s - co ##v tracking system ; ( b ) identification of positive mer ##s - co ##v cases ; ( c ) containment of cross in ##fect ##ivity ; and ( d ) increased efficiency in ed functioning . methods : a retrospective chart review was carried out of all ed patients suspected of mer ##s - co ##v during the height of the epidemic ( august to october 2013 ) . an algorithm was created on the basis of international guidelines to screen and tri ##age suspected mer ##s - co ##v patients . once identified , patients were isolated , had a chest roe ##nt ##gen ##og ##ram [ chest radio ##graphy ( c ##x ##r ) ] taken , and a nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab for pc ##r was sent with sp ##ut ##um samples for testing . patients with normal c ##x ##r and mild respiratory symptoms were discharged with home isolation instructions until nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and sp ##ut ##um pc ##r results were available . patients with fever and acute respiratory distress , with or without abnormal c ##x ##r , were treated in the hospital until tests proved negative for mer ##s - co ##v . results : the protocol successfully reduced the number of patients who needed to be tested for mer ##s - co ##v from 12 56 ##3 to 51 ##4 , identified seven positive cases , and did not lead to apparent cross in ##fect ##ivity that resulted in serious illness or death . the protocol also increased the efficiency of ed and cut the turn ##around time for nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab and sp ##ut ##um results from 3 days to 1 day . conclusion : a highly protocol ##ized surveillance system limited the impact of mer ##s - co ##v on ed functioning by identifying and prior ##iti ##zing high - risk patients . the emergence of new infectious diseases requires constant monitoring of interventions to reduce the impact of epidemic ##s on population health and health services .  
there were 211 , 000 indonesian ha ##j ##j pilgrims going to mecca through 11 main airports in 2015 who were at risk of contracting the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . we aimed to find out whether there was any occurrence of mer ##s - co ##v by performing screening on 28 , 197 returning pilgrims . those with a body temperature of > 38 °c and respiratory symptoms were sent to the airport clinic to have an oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab and a bacterial culture . fifteen pilgrims had fever ( > 38 °c ) accompanied by respiratory symptoms ; of these , 12 patients were diagnosed with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and three patients with pneumonia . however , none of them were found to be infected with mer ##s - co ##v . the bacterial cultures showed evidence of normal flora growth .  
we have recently demonstrated that the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) also media ##tes cellular entry of the newly discovered human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) nl ##6 ##3 . here , we show that expression of dc - sign aug ##ments nl ##6 ##3 spike ( s ) - protein - driven infection of susceptible cells , while only expression of ace ##2 but not dc - sign is sufficient for entry into non ##per ##missive cells , indicating that ace ##2 fulfill ##s the criteria of a bon ##a fide hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 receptor . as for sar ##s - co ##v , mu ##rine ace ##2 is used less efficiently by nl ##6 ##3 - s for entry than human ace ##2 . in contrast , several amino acid exchanges in human ace ##2 which dim ##ini ##sh sar ##s - s - driven entry do not interfere with nl ##6 ##3 - s - mediated infection , suggesting that sar ##s - s and nl ##6 ##3 - s might engage human ace ##2 differential ##ly . moreover , we observed that nl ##6 ##3 - s - driven entry was less dependent on a low - ph environment and activity of end ##osomal pro ##tea ##ses compared to infection mediated by sar ##s - s , further suggesting differences in hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 and sar ##s - co ##v cellular entry . nl ##6 ##3 - s does not exhibit significant homo ##logy to sar ##s - s but is highly related to the s - protein of hc ##ov - 229 ##e , which enters target cells by engaging cd ##13 . employing mu ##tage ##nic analyses , we found that the n - terminal unique domain in nl ##6 ##3 - s , which is absent in 229 ##e - s , does not con ##fer binding to ace ##2 . in contrast , the highly homo ##log ##ous c - terminal parts of the nl ##6 ##3 - s ##1 and 229 ##e - s ##1 subunit ##s in conjunction with distinct amino acids in the central regions of these proteins con ##fer recognition of ace ##2 and cd ##13 , respectively . therefore , despite the high homo ##logy of these sequences , they likely form sufficiently distinct surfaces , thus determining receptor specific ##ity .  
rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein was employed to establish an antigen - capturing enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . anti ##nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein antibodies could be detected in 68 . 4 % of probable sar ##s patients 6 to 10 days after illness and in 89 . 6 % of the patients 11 to 61 days after illness . no false - positive results were observed in 20 non - sar ##s fever patients , 24 non - sar ##s respiratory illness patients , and 20 health care workers . among 94 ##0 other non - sar ##s clinical serum samples , only 1 was found to be weakly positive . this method provides a new , sensitive , and specific approach for sar ##s diagnosis .  
introduction : the continual middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) threat highlights the importance of developing effective anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s to prevent and treat mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . a surface spike ( s ) protein guides mer ##s - co ##v entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , followed by fusion between virus and host cell membranes . mer ##s - co ##v s protein represents a key target for developing therapeutic ##s to block viral entry and inhibit membrane fusion . areas covered : this review illustrates mer ##s - co ##v s protein ’ s structure and function , particularly s ##1 receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) and s ##2 he ##pta ##d repeat 1 ( hr ##1 ) as therapeutic targets , and sum ##mar ##izes current advancement on developing anti - mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic ##s , focusing on neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) and anti ##vira ##l peptide ##s . expert opinion : no anti - mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic is approved for human use . several s - targeting neutral ##izing mab ##s and peptide ##s have demonstrated efficacy against mer ##s - co ##v infection , providing feasibility for development . generally , human neutral ##izing mab ##s targeting rb ##d are more potent than those targeting other regions of s protein . however , emergence of escape mutant viruses and mab ’ s limitations make it necessary for combining neutral ##izing mab ##s recognizing different neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes and engineering them with improved efficacy and reduced cost . optimization of the peptide sequences is expected to produce next - generation anti - mer ##s - co ##v peptide ##s with improved pot ##ency .  
the recently identified et ##iol ##ogical agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) belongs to corona ##vir ##idae ( co ##v ) , a family of viruses replica ##ting by a poorly understood mechanism . here , we report the crystal structure at 2 . 7 - a resolution of ns ##p ##9 , a hit ##her ##to un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized subunit of the sar ##s - co ##v replica ##tive poly ##pro ##tein ##s . we show that sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##9 is a single - stranded rna - binding protein displaying a previously un ##re ##port ##ed , ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##de / ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide fold - like fold . the presence of this type of protein has not been detected in the replica ##tive complexes of rna viruses , and its presence may reflect the unique and complex co ##v viral replication / transcription machinery .  
a western im ##mun ##ob ##lot ass ##ay for confirm ##atory ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was developed utilizing viral l ##ys ##ate antigen ##s combined with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , gs ##t - n ( g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ) of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the viral l ##ys ##ate antigen ##s were separated by electro ##ph ##ores ##is and trans ##bl ##otted onto ni ##tro ##cel ##lu ##los ##e membranes . the resultant membrane was subsequently added with the gs ##t - n rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein at a specific location . the positions of bands corresponding to some of the structural proteins im ##mo ##bil ##ized on the membrane were then located and verified with mouse or rabbit anti ##ser ##a specific to the respective proteins . the western im ##mun ##ob ##lot ass ##ay was able to detect antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v in all 40 serum specimens from sar ##s patients and differentiate the sar ##s - positive samples from those of the healthy donor or non - sar ##s patient controls ( 150 samples ) when set criteria were followed . in addition , when the im ##mun ##ob ##lot was used to test samples considered falsely positive by an in - house - developed sar ##s - specific enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay , band patterns different from those with samples from sar ##s patients were obtained .  
we verified the analytical performance characteristics of a previously described real - time reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ay targeting the open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1b region of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) with rna transcript ##s . we then compared it to a novel nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay with gen ##omic rna . the ass ##ays differed only in the prime ##r and probe sequences and final concentrations . a commercially available armored rna ( am ##bio ##n , austin , tex . ) was evaluated as positive control for the or ##f 1b ass ##ay . the analytical sensitivity , rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility , amp ##li ##fication efficiency , and dynamic range of the ass ##ays were similar . both were specific for sar ##s - co ##v as determined by testing against human co ##v 229 ##e and o ##c ##43 , specimens from patients without sar ##s , and by blast searches of gen ##bank for prime ##r and probe sequence homo ##logy . the armored rna was found to be a suitable positive control for the or ##f 1b ass ##ay that could be re ##lia ##bly recovered and amplified from a variety of clinical specimens .  
antigen ##ic sites on the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were mapped by pep ##scan analysis with overlapping peptide ##s that span the n protein sequence . two major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes located in the c - terminal region ( amino acids [ aa ] 36 ##2 to 412 ) and middle region ( aa 153 to 178 ) reacted with more than 75 % of sera from sar ##s patients . several minor im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes were reactive with about 50 % of the sar ##s sera . anti ##ser ##a from mice im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v recognized the two major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes and one antigen ##ic site located adjacent to the n - terminal region ( aa 76 to 101 ) , which did not react with the sera from sar ##s patients . several mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v bound to the n - or c - terminal antigen ##ic sites . these results suggest that the above antigen ##ic sites on the n protein are important in eli ##cit ##ing humor ##al immune response against sar ##s - co ##v in humans and animals and can be used as antigen ##s for developing diagnostic tests .  
to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) infection , a corona ##virus protein micro ##ar ##ray that harbor ##s proteins from sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and five additional corona ##virus ##es was constructed . these micro ##ar ##ray ##s were used to screen ≈ ##400 canadian sera from the sar ##s outbreak , including samples from confirmed sar ##s - co ##v cases , respiratory illness patients , and healthcare professionals . a computer algorithm that uses multiple class ##ifiers to predict samples from sar ##s patients was developed and used to predict 206 sera from chinese fever patients . the test assigned patients into two distinct groups : those with antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v and those without . the micro ##ar ##ray also identified patients with sera reactive against other corona ##virus proteins . our results correlated well with an indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence test and demonstrated that viral infection can be monitored for many months after infection . we show that protein micro ##ar ##ray ##s can serve as a rapid , sensitive , and simple tool for large - scale identification of viral - specific antibodies in sera .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 , and detailed phylogenetic and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analyses have suggested that it originated from animals . the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein has been identified as a major component of protective immunity , and 23 different amino acid changes were noted during the expanding epidemic . using a panel of sar ##s - co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nts bearing the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s from isolate ##s representing the zoo ##not ##ic and human early , middle , and late phases of the epidemic , we identified 23 mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) with neutral ##izing activity against one or multiple sar ##s - co ##v spike variants and determined the presence of at least six distinct neutral ##izing profiles in the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . four of these mab ##s showed cross - neutral ##izing activity against all human and zoo ##not ##ic s variants in vitro , and at least three of these were mapped in distinct ep ##ito ##pes using escape mutants , structure analyses , and competition ass ##ays . these three mab ##s ( s ##10 ##9 . 8 , s ##22 ##7 . 14 , and s ##23 ##0 . 15 ) were tested for use in passive va ##cci ##nation studies using lethal sar ##s - co ##v challenge models for young and sen ##es ##cent mice with four different homo ##log ##ous and het ##ero ##log ##ous sar ##s - co ##v s variants . both s ##22 ##7 . 14 and s ##23 ##0 . 15 completely protected young and old mice from weight loss and virus replication in the lungs for all viruses tested , while s ##10 ##9 . 8 completely protected mice from weight loss and clinical signs in the presence of viral ti ##ters . we conclude that a single human mab can con ##fer broad protection against lethal challenge with multiple zoo ##not ##ic and human sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , and we identify a robust cocktail formulation that targets distinct ep ##ito ##pes and minimize ##s the likely generation of escape mutants .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) open reading frame 3a protein has recently been shown to be a structural protein . the protein is encoded by one of the so - called group - specific genes and has no sequence homo ##logy with any of the known structural or group - specific proteins of corona ##virus ##es . it does , however , have several similarities to the corona ##virus m proteins ; ( i ) they are triple membrane spanning with the same topology , ( ii ) they have similar intra ##cellular local ##izations ( predominantly go ##l ##gi ) , ( iii ) both are viral structural proteins , and ( iv ) they appear to interact with the e and s proteins , as well as with each other . the m protein plays a crucial role in corona ##virus assembly and is g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted in all corona ##virus ##es , either by n - linked or by o - linked ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des . the conserved g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of the corona ##virus m proteins and the resemblance of the 3a protein to them led us to investigate the g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of these two sar ##s - co ##v membrane proteins . the proteins were expressed separately using the va ##cci ##nia virus t ##7 expression system , followed by metabolic labeling . pulse - chase analysis showed that both proteins were modified , although in different ways . while the m protein acquired cot ##ran ##sl ##ation ##ally ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des that could be removed by p ##nga ##sef , the 3a protein acquired its modifications post ##tra ##ns ##lation ##ally , and they were not sensitive to the n - g ##ly ##cos ##ida ##se enzyme . the sar ##s - co ##v 3a protein , however , was demonstrated to contain si ##alic acids , indicating the presence of ol ##igo ##sa ##cc ##hari ##des . o - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of the 3a protein was indeed confirmed using an in situ o - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion ass ##ay of end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum - retained mutants . in addition , we showed that substitution of ser ##ine and th ##re ##oni ##ne residues in the ec ##to ##dom ##ain of the 3a protein abolished the addition of the o - linked sugar ##s . thus , the sar ##s - co ##v 3a protein is an o - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , like the group 2 corona ##virus m proteins but unlike the sar ##s - co ##v m protein , which is n g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted .  
to evaluate the react ##ivity of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli strain b ##l ##21 ( de ##3 ) , a western b ##lot ass ##ay was performed by using a panel of 78 serum samples obtained , respectively , from con ##vale ##scent - phase patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ( 30 samples ) and from healthy donors ( 48 samples ) . as antigen for detection of sar ##s - co ##v , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) showed high sensitivity and strong react ##ivity with all samples from sar ##s - co ##v patients and cross - reacted with all serum samples from healthy subjects , with either those obtained from china ( 10 samples ) or those obtained from france ( 38 serum samples ) , giving then a significant rate of false positive ##s . specifically , our data indicated that the two subunit ##s , s ##1 ( residues 14 to 760 ) and s ##2 ( residues 76 ##1 to 119 ##0 ) , resulted from the divided spike reacted with all samples from sar ##s - co ##v patients and without any cross - react ##ivity with any of the healthy serum samples . consequently , these data revealed the non ##sp ##ec ##ific nature of n protein in ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v compared with the s ##1 and s ##2 , where the specific ##ity is of 100 % . moreover , the reported results indicated that the use of one single protein as a detection antigen of sar ##s - co ##v infection may lead to false - positive diagnosis . these may be rec ##ti ##fied by using more than one protein for the ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in november 2002 as a case of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia in china , and the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s was identified to be a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . bone marrow st ##rom ##al antigen 2 ( bs ##t - 2 ; also known as cd ##31 ##7 or te ##ther ##in ) was initially identified to be a pre - b - cell growth promoter , but it also inhibit ##s the release of vi ##rion ##s of the retro ##virus human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) by te ##ther ##ing bud ##ding vi ##rion ##s to the host cell membrane . further work has shown that bs ##t - 2 restrict ##s the release of many other viruses , including the human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) , and the genome ##s of many of these viruses en ##code bs ##t - 2 antagonist ##s to overcome bs ##t - 2 restriction . given the previous studies on bs ##t - 2 , we aimed to determine if bs ##t - 2 has the ability to restrict sar ##s - co ##v and if the sar ##s - co ##v genome en ##codes any proteins that mod ##ulate bs ##t - 2 ' s anti ##vira ##l function . through an in vitro screen , we identified four potential bs ##t - 2 mod ##ulator ##s encoded by the sar ##s - co ##v genome : the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ( pro ) ) , non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 1 ( ns ##p ##1 ) , or ##f ##6 , and or ##f ##7 ##a . as the function of or ##f ##7 ##a in sar ##s - co ##v replication was previously unknown , we focused our study on or ##f ##7 ##a . we found that bs ##t - 2 does restrict sar ##s - co ##v , but the loss of or ##f ##7 ##a leads to a much greater restriction , confirming the role of or ##f ##7 ##a as an inhibitor of bs ##t - 2 . we further characterized the mechanism of bs ##t - 2 inhibition by or ##f ##7 ##a and found that or ##f ##7 ##a local ##ization changes when bs ##t - 2 is over ##ex ##pressed and or ##f ##7 ##a binds directly to bs ##t - 2 . finally , we also show that sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##7 ##a blocks the restriction activity of bs ##t - 2 by blocking the g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of bs ##t - 2 . importance the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged from zoo ##not ##ic sources in 2002 and caused over 8 , 000 infections and 800 deaths
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection . serum from con ##vale ##scent mer ##s patients may provide some benefit but is not readily available . in contrast , nearly all camel ##s in the middle east have been infected with mer ##s - co ##v . here , we show that sera obtained from mer ##s - immune camel ##s aug ##ment the kinetic ##s of mer ##s - co ##v clearance and reduce the severity of path ##ological changes in infected lungs , with efficacy proportional to the ti ##ter of mer ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing serum antibody . importance middle east respiratory syndrome , caused by a corona ##virus , is highly lethal , with a case fatal ##ity rate of 35 to 40 % . no specific therapy is available , and care is generally supportive . one promising approach is passive administration of sera from con ##vale ##scent human mer ##s patients or other animals to exposed or infected patients . the vast majority of , if not all , camel ##s in the middle east have been infected with mer ##s - co ##v , and some contain high ti ##ters of antibody to the virus . here , we show that this antibody is protective if delivered either prop ##hyl ##actic ##ally or therapeutic ##ally to mice infected with mer ##s - co ##v , indicating that this may be a useful intervention in infected patients .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease , caused by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and is considered to be a zoo ##nosis . however , the natural reservoirs of mer ##s - co ##v remain obscure , with bats and camel ##s as the most suspected sources . in this article , we review the evidence supporting a bat / camel origin of human mer ##s - co ##v infection and current knowledge on the modes of camel - to - human transmission of mer ##s - co ##v .  
we have identified the membrane - active regions of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein by determining the effect on model membrane integrity of a 16 / 18 - mer sar ##s co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein peptide library . by monitoring the effect of this peptide library on membrane leak ##age in model membranes , we have identified three regions on the sar ##s co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein with membrane - interacting capabilities : region 1 , located immediately upstream of he ##pta ##d repeat 1 ( hr ##1 ) and suggested to be the fusion peptide ; region 2 , located between hr ##1 and hr ##2 , which would be analogous to the loop domain of human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus type 1 ; and region 3 , which would correspond to the pre ##tra ##ns ##me ##mb ##rane region . the identification of these membrane - active regions , which are capable of modifying the bio ##physical properties of ph ##os ##ph ##oli ##pid membranes , supports their direct role in sar ##s co ##v - mediated membrane fusion , as well as facilitating the future development of sar ##s co ##v entry inhibitors .  
bats are reservoirs for a wide range of human pathogen ##s including ni ##pa ##h , hen ##dra , ra ##bies , e ##bola , mar ##burg and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the recent implication of a novel beta ( β ) - co ##v as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the middle east emphasizes the importance of surveillance for co ##vs that have potential to move from bats into the human population . in a screen of 60 ##6 bats from 42 different species in camp ##eche , chi ##apa ##s and mexico city we identified 13 distinct co ##vs . nine were alpha ( α ) - co ##vs ; four were β - co ##vs . twelve were novel . analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in co ##v evolution , even in all ##opa ##tric populations separated by significant geographical distance ; and that a single species / genus of bat can contain multiple co ##vs . a β - co ##v with 96 . 5 % amino acid identity to the β - co ##v associated with human disease in the middle east was found in a nyc ##tino ##mo ##ps la ##tica ##uda ##tus bat , suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families mo ##los ##si ##dae / ve ##sper ##ti ##lion ##idae , or the closely related nyc ##ter ##idae / em ##ball ##on ##uri ##dae . while it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats , it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk , and bats should not be stigma ##tized ubiquitous ##ly as significant threats to public health .  
one of the hallmark findings in patients suffering from sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) is l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , which is the result of massive l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte death . sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s corona ##virus ) , a novel corona ##virus that has been et ##iol ##ogical ##ly associated with sar ##s cases , is homo ##log ##ous with m ##h ##v ( mu ##rine hepatitis corona ##virus ) , and m ##h ##v small envelope e protein is capable of inducing ap ##op ##tosis . we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that sar ##s - co ##v en ##codes a small envelope e protein that is homo ##log ##ous with m ##h ##v e protein , thus inducing t - cell ap ##op ##tosis . to test this hypothesis , a cd ##na encoding sar ##s - co ##v e protein was created using whole gene synthesis . our results showed that sar ##s - co ##v e protein induced ap ##op ##tosis in the trans ##fect ##ed ju ##rka ##t t - cells , which was amplified to higher ap ##op ##tosis rates in the absence of growth factors . however , ap ##op ##tosis was inhibit ##ed by over ##ex ##pressed anti ##ap ##op ##to ##tic protein bc ##l - xl . moreover , we found that sar ##s - co ##v e protein interact ##ed with bc ##l - xl in vitro and end ##ogen ##ous bc ##l - xl in vivo and that bc ##l - xl interaction with sar ##s - co ##v e protein was mediated by b ##h ##3 ( bc ##l - 2 homo ##logy domain 3 ) of bc ##l - xl . finally , we identified a novel b ##h ##3 - like region located in the c - terminal cy ##tos ##olic domain of sar ##s - co ##v e protein , which media ##tes its binding to bc ##l - xl . these results demonstrate , for the first time , a novel molecular mechanism of t - cell ap ##op ##tosis that contributes to the sar ##s - co ##v - induced l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia observed in most sar ##s patients .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , also called infectious at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel variant of corona ##virus ( sar ##s - associated corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v ) . it is mainly characterized by pulmonary infection with a high in ##fect ##ivity and fatal ##ity . sar ##s is swept across almost all the continents of the globe , and has currently involved 33 countries and regions , including the mainland china , hong kong , taiwan , north america and europe . on june 30 , 2003 , an ac ##um ##ula ##tive total reached 84 ##50 cases with 81 ##0 deaths . sar ##s epidemic was very rampant in march , april and may 2003 in the mainland of china and hong kong . chinese scientists and healthcare workers cooperate ##d closely with other scientists from all over the world to fight the disease . on april 16 , 2003 , world health organization ( who ) formally declared that sar ##s - co ##v was an et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s . currently , there is no specific and effective therapy and prevention method for sar ##s . the main treatments include co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid therapy , anti - viral agents , anti - infection , mechanical ventilation and isolation . this disease can be prevented and controlled , and it is also cu ##rable . under the endeavor of the chinese government , medical staff ##s and other related professionals , sar ##s has been under control in china , and chinese scientists have also made a great contribution to sar ##s research . other studies in developing new detection ass ##ays and the ##ra ##pies , and discovering new drugs and vaccines are in progress . in this paper , we briefly review the current status of sar ##s in china .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) represent highly pathogen ##ic human co ##vs that share a property to inhibit host gene expression at the post ##tra ##ns ##cript ##ional level . similar to the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 1 ( ns ##p ##1 ) of sar ##s - co ##v that inhibit ##s host gene expression at the translation ##al level , we report that mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 also exhibits a conserved function to negatively regulate host gene expression by inhibit ##ing host mrna translation and inducing the degradation of host mrna ##s . furthermore , like sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , the mrna degradation activity of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , most probably triggered by its ability to induce an end ##on ##uc ##le ##ol ##ytic rna cleavage , was sep ##arable from its translation inhibitor ##y function . despite these functional similarities , mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 used a striking ##ly different strategy that selective ##ly targeted translation ##ally competent host mrna ##s for inhibition . while sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 is localized exclusively in the cy ##top ##las ##m and binds to the 40 ##s rib ##osomal subunit to gain access to translating mrna ##s , mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 was distributed in both the nucleus and the cy ##top ##las ##m and did not bind stab ##ly to the 40 ##s subunit , suggesting a distinctly different mode of targeting translating mrna ##s . interesting ##ly , consistent with this notion , mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 selective ##ly targeted mrna ##s , which are transcribed in the nucleus and transported to the cy ##top ##las ##m , for translation inhibition and mrna degradation but spared ex ##ogen ##ous mrna ##s introduced directly into the cy ##top ##las ##m or virus - like mrna ##s that originate in the cy ##top ##las ##m . collectively , these data point toward a novel viral strategy wherein the cy ##top ##las ##mic origin of mer ##s - co ##v mrna ##s facilitates their escape from the inhibitor ##y effects of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 . importance middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic human co ##v that emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 . mer ##s - co ##v has a zoo ##not ##ic origin and poses a major threat to public health . however , little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high vi ##ru ##lence of mer ##s - co ##v . many animal viruses , including co ##vs , en ##code proteins that interfere with host gene expression , including those involved in anti ##vira ##l immune responses , and these viral proteins are
the reverse transcription ( rt ) - pc ##r protocols of two world health organization ( who ) severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) network laboratories ( who sar ##s network laboratories at the university of hong kong [ who - hk ##u ] and at the bernhard - no ##cht institute in hamburg , germany [ who - hamburg ] ) were evaluated for rapid diagnosis of a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) associated with sar ##s in hong kong . a total of 303 clinical specimens were collected from 163 patients suspected to have sar ##s . the end point of both who - hk ##u and who - hamburg rt - pc ##r ass ##ays was determined to be 0 . 1 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive dose . using ser ##oco ##n ##version to co ##v as the “ gold standard ” for sar ##s co ##v diagnosis , who - hk ##u and who - hamburg rt - pc ##r ass ##ays exhibited diagnostic sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 61 and 68 % ( nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate specimens ) , 65 and 72 % ( throat sw ##ab specimens ) , 50 and 54 % ( urine specimens ) , and 58 and 63 % ( stool specimens ) , respectively , with an overall specific ##ity of 100 % . for patients confirmed to have sar ##s co ##v and from whom two or more respiratory specimens were collected , testing the second specimen increased the sensitivity from 64 and 71 % to 75 and 79 % for the who - hk ##u and who - hamburg rt - pc ##r ass ##ays , respectively . testing more than one respiratory specimen will maximize the sensitivity of pc ##r ass ##ays for sar ##s co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus that causes mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in humans . after infection with sar ##s - co ##v , the acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function . a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation in this wound healing process leads to fi ##bro ##sis . many survivors of sar ##s - co ##v infection develop pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis ( p ##f ) , with higher prevalence in older patients . using mouse models of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , we have identified that the wound repair pathway , controlled by the ep ##ider ##mal growth factor receptor ( e ##gf ##r ) , is critical to recovery from sar ##s - co ##v - induced tissue damage . in mice with con ##sti ##tu ##tively active e ##gf ##r [ e ##gf ##r ( ds ##k ##5 ) mice ] , we find that sar ##s - co ##v infection causes enhanced lung disease . importantly , we show that during infection , the e ##gf ##r ligand ##s amp ##hire ##gul ##in and he ##par ##in - binding e ##gf - like growth factor ( h ##b - e ##gf ) are up ##re ##gul ##ated , and ex ##ogen ##ous addition of these ligand ##s during infection leads to enhanced lung disease and altered wound healing dynamics . our data demonstrate a key role of e ##gf ##r in the host response to sar ##s - co ##v and how it may be implicated in lung disease induced by other highly pathogen ##ic respiratory viruses . importance p ##f has many ca ##usa ##tive triggers , including severe respiratory viruses such as sar ##s - co ##v . currently there are no treatments to prevent the onset or limit the progression of p ##f , and the molecular pathways underlying the development of p ##f are not well understood . in this study , we identified a role for the balanced control of e ##gf ##r signaling as a key factor in progression to p ##f . these data demonstrate that therapeutic treatment mod ##ulating e ##gf ##r activation could protect against p ##f development caused by severe respiratory virus infection .  
aims : to develop a quantitative reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( q - rt - pc ##r ) for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) detection and explore the potential of using g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##de - 3 - phosphate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ( gap ##dh ) mrna as an internal control to exclude false negative results . methods : sar ##s - co ##v and gap ##dh mrna were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with sar ##s , 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients , and appropriate control subjects . the relation between sar ##s po ##sit ##ivity and gap ##dh mrna concentration was investigated using the χ ( 2 ) test . increasing the sensitivity for sar ##s - co ##v and gap ##dh mrna detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which sar ##s - co ##v and gap ##dh mrna were not detected initially . results : varying amounts of sar ##s - co ##v were found in the 26 sar ##s - co ##v positive specimens and sar ##s - co ##v was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls . in addition , concentrations of gap ##dh mrna were significantly different between the patients with sar ##s , follow up specimens , and healthy controls ( k ##rus ##kal - wallis test , p < 0 . 05 ) . moreover , gap ##dh mrna concentrations were highly correlated with sar ##s - co ##v po ##sit ##ivity ( χ ( 2 ) = 5 . 43 ; p < 0 . 05 ) . finally , sar ##s - co ##v and gap ##dh mrna were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cd ##na used was increased from 5 μ ##l to 10 and 15 μ ##l . conclusions : this q - rt - pc ##r ass ##ay can be used to detect sar ##s - co ##v . moreover , gap ##dh mrna may be useful to rule out false negative results in sar ##s - co ##v detection , and the current extraction method for urine may not be sensitive enough to detect low ti ##tres of sar ##s - co ##v .  
we previously reported that trans ##genic ( t ##g ) mice expressing human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) , the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , were highly susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection , which resulted in the development of disease of various severity and even death in some lineage ##s . in this study , we further characterized and compared the pathogen ##eses of sar ##s - co ##v infection in two of the most stable t ##g lineage ##s , ac ##70 and ac ##22 , representing those susceptible and resistant to the lethal sar ##s - co ##v infection , respectively . the kinetic ##s of virus replication and the inflammatory responses within the lungs and brains , as well as the clinical and path ##ological outcomes , were assessed in each lineage . in addition , we generated information on l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte subset ##s and mit ##ogen - mediated proliferation of sp ##len ##ocytes . we found that while both lineage ##s were per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v infection , causing elevated secret ##ion of many inflammatory media ##tors within the lungs and brains , viral infection appeared to be more intense in ac ##70 than in ac ##22 mice , especially in the brain . moreover , such infection was accompanied by a more profound immune suppression in the former , as evidenced by the extensive loss of t cells , compromised responses to con ##cana ##val ##in a stimulation , and absence of inflammatory infiltrate ##s within the brain . we also found that cd ##8 ( + ) t cells were partially effective in at ##ten ##uating the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v infection in lethal ##ity - resistant ac ##22 mice . collectively , our data revealed a more intense viral infection and im ##mun ##os ##up ##press ##ion in ac ##70 mice than in ac ##22 mice , thereby providing us with an im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogenic basis for the fatal outcome of sar ##s - co ##v infection in the ac ##70 mice .  
bats may host emerging viruses , including corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) . we conducted an evaluation of co ##v in rhino ##lo ##phi ##d and ve ##sper ##ti ##lion ##id bat species common in europe . rhino ##lo ##phi ##ds carried severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - related co ##v at high frequencies and concentrations ( 26 % of animals are positive ; up to 2 . 4 × 10 ( 8 ) copies per gram of fe ##ces ) , as well as two alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus clade ##s , one novel and one related to the hk ##u ##2 clade . all three clade ##s present in mini ##op ##ter ##us bats in china ( hk ##u ##7 , hk ##u ##8 , and 1a related ) were also present in european mini ##op ##ter ##us bats . an additional novel alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus clade ( bat co ##v [ bt ##co ##v ] / bn ##m ##9 ##8 - 30 ) was detected in nyc ##tal ##us lei ##sler ##i . a co ##v grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 81 ##6 - bp fragment of the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ##s ( rd ##rp ) of all accepted mammalian co ##v species ( rd ##rp - based grouping units [ r ##gu ] ) . criteria for defining separate r ##gu in mammalian co ##v were a > 4 . 8 % amino acid distance for alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es and a > 6 . 3 % distance for beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . all the above - mentioned novel clade ##s represented independent r ##gu . strict associations between co ##v r ##gu and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent r ##gu represented simultaneously in china and europe . a sar ##s - related virus ( bt ##co ##v / b ##m ##48 - 31 / bulgaria / 2008 ) from a rhino ##lo ##phus b ##las ##ii ( r ##hi b ##la ) bat was fully sequence ##d . it is predicted that proteins 3 ##b and 6 were highly diver ##gent from those proteins in all known sar ##s - related co ##v . open reading frame 8 ( or ##f ##8 ) was surprisingly absent . surface expression of spike and stain ##ing with sera of sar ##s survivors suggested low antigen ##ic overlap with sar ##s co ##v . however , the receptor binding domain of sar ##s co ##v showed higher similarity with that of bt ##co ##v / b ##m ##48 - 31 / bulgaria / 2008 than with that of any chinese bat - borne co ##v . critical spike domains 47 ##2 and 48 ##7 were identical and similar , respectively . this study under ##lines the importance of assessments of the zoo ##not ##ic potential of widely distributed bat - borne co ##v .  
as a novel corona ##virus first reported by saudi arabia in 2012 , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is responsible for an acute human respiratory syndrome . the virus , of 2 ##c beta - co ##v lineage , expresses the dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) receptor and is densely endemic in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s of east africa and the arabian peninsula . mer ##s - co ##v is zoo ##not ##ic but human - to - human transmission is also possible . surveillance and phylogenetic researches indicate mer ##s - co ##v to be closely associated with bats ’ corona ##virus ##es , suggesting bats as reservoirs , although un ##con ##firmed . with no vaccine currently available for mer ##s - co ##v nor approved prop ##hyl ##actic ##s , its global spread to over 25 countries with high fatalities highlights its role as ongoing public health threat . an articulated action plan ought to be taken , prefer ##ably from a one health perspective , for appropriately advanced counter ##me ##as ##ures against mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly identified beta ##cor ##ona ##virus causing high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in humans . the corona ##virus spike ( s ) protein is the main deter ##mina ##nt of viral entry , and although it was previously shown that mer ##s - co ##v s can be activated by various pro ##tea ##ses , the details of the mechanisms of pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activation of fusion are still incomplete ##ly characterized . here , we have uncovered distinctive characteristics of mer ##s - co ##v s . we identify , by bio ##in ##form ##atics and peptide cleavage ass ##ays , two cleavage sites for fur ##in , a ubiquitous ##ly expressed pro ##tea ##se , which are located at the s ##1 / s ##2 interface and at the s ##2 ′ position of the s protein . we show that although the s ##1 / s ##2 site is pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally processed by fur ##in during protein bio ##sy ##nt ##hesis , the s ##2 ′ site is cl ##ea ##ved upon viral entry . mer ##s - co ##v pseudo ##vir ##ion infection was shown to be enhanced by elevated levels of fur ##in expression , and entry could be decreased by fur ##in sir ##na si ##len ##cing . enhanced fur ##in activity appeared to partially over ##ride the low ph - dependent nature of mer ##s - co ##v entry . inhibition of fur ##in activity was shown to decrease mer ##s - co ##v s - mediated entry , as well as infection by the virus . overall , we show that mer ##s - co ##v has evolved an unusual two - step fur ##in activation for fusion , suggest ##ive of a role during the process of emergence into the human population . the ability of mer ##s - co ##v to use fur ##in in this manner , along with other pro ##tea ##ses , may explain the poly ##tro ##pic nature of the virus .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has represented a human health threat since 2012 . although several mer ##s - related co ##vs that belong to the same species as mer ##s - co ##v have been identified from bats , they do not use the mer ##s - co ##v receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . here , we screened 1 , 05 ##9 bat samples from at least 30 bat species collected in different regions in south china and identified 89 strains of lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , including ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is pac ##hy ##pus corona ##virus hk ##u ##4 , pip ##ist ##rell ##us pip ##ist ##rell ##us corona ##virus hk ##u ##5 , and mer ##s - related co ##vs . we sequence ##d the full - length genome ##s of two positive samples collected from the great evening bat , ia io , from guangdong province . the two genome ##s were highly similar and exhibited gen ##omic structures identical to those of other lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . while they exhibited genome - wide nu ##cle ##otide identities of only 75 . 3 to 81 . 2 % with other mer ##s - related co ##vs , their gene - coding regions were highly similar to their counterparts , except in the case of the spike proteins . further protein - protein interaction ass ##ays demonstrated that the spike proteins of these mer ##s - related co ##vs bind to the receptor d ##pp ##4 . rec ##om ##bina ##tion analysis suggested that the newly discovered mer ##s - related co ##vs have acquired their spike genes from a d ##pp ##4 - recognizing bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##4 . our study provides further evidence that bats represent the evolutionary origins of mer ##s - co ##v . importance previous studies suggested that mer ##s - co ##v originated in bats . however , its evolutionary path from bats to humans remains unclear . in this study , we discovered 89 novel lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in eight bat species . we provide evidence of a mer ##s - related co ##v derived from the great evening bat that uses the same host receptor as human mer ##s - co ##v . this virus also provides evidence for a natural rec ##om ##bina ##tion event between the bat mer ##s - related co ##v and another bat corona ##virus , hk ##u ##4 . our study expands the host ranges of mer ##s - related co ##v and represents an important step toward establishing bats as the natural reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v . these findings may lead to improved ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v and the prevention and control of the spread of mer ##s - co ##v to humans .  
taiwan experienced a series of outbreak ##s of nos ##oco ##mia ##l severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) infections in 2003 . two months after the final outbreak , we recruited 65 ##8 employees from the hospital that suffered the first and most severe sar ##s infections to help us investigate ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and genetic factors associated with the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . sar ##s - co ##v infections were detected by using enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys and confirmed by a combination of western b ##lot ass ##ays , neutral ##izing antibody tests , and commercial sar ##s tests . risk factors were analyzed via question ##naire responses and sequence - specific ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide probe ##s of human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) all ##eles . our results indicate that 3 % ( 20 / 65 ##8 ) of the study participants were ser ##op ##osi ##tive , with one female nurse identified as a sub ##cl ##ini ##cal case . identified sar ##s - co ##v infection risk factors include working in the same building as the hospital ' s emergency room and infection ward , providing direct care to sar ##s patients , and carrying a cw * 08 ##01 h ##la all ##ele . the odds ratio for contracting a sar ##s - co ##v infection among persons with either a homo ##zy ##go ##us or a het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us cw * 08 ##01 gen ##otype was 4 . 4 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 12 . 9 ; p = 0 . 00 ##7 ) .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe respiratory illness . whole uv - inactivated sar ##s - co ##v ( uv - v ) , bearing multiple ep ##ito ##pes and proteins , is a candidate vaccine against this virus . however , whole inactivated sar ##s vaccine that includes nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein is reported to induce e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic in ##filtration in mouse lungs after challenge with live sar ##s - co ##v . in this study , an ability of toll - like receptor ( t ##lr ) ago ##nist ##s to reduce the side effects of uv - v va ##cci ##nation in a 6 - month - old adult bal ##b / c mouse model was investigated , using the mouse - passage ##d frankfurt 1 isolate of sar ##s - co ##v . im ##mun ##ization of adult mice with uv - v , with or without al ##um , resulted in partial protection from lethal doses of sar ##s - co ##v challenge , but extensive e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l in ##filtration in the lungs was observed . in contrast , t ##lr ago ##nist ##s added to uv - v vaccine , including lip ##op ##ol ##ys ##ac ##cha ##ride , poly ( u ) , and poly ( i · c ) ( uv - v + t ##lr ) , striking ##ly reduced excess e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic in ##filtration in the lungs and induced lower levels of inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 and - 13 and e ##ota ##xin in the lungs than uv - v - im ##mun ##ization alone . additionally , micro ##ar ##ray analysis showed that genes associated with che ##mot ##ax ##is , e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l migration , e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lia , and cell movement and the polar ##ization of th ##2 cells were up ##re ##gul ##ated in uv - v - im ##mun ##ized but not in uv - v + t ##lr - im ##mun ##ized mice . in particular , cd ##11 ##b ( + ) cells in the lungs of uv - v - im ##mun ##ized mice showed the up ##re ##gul ##ation of genes associated with the induction of e ##osi ##no ##phi ##ls after challenge . these findings suggest that vaccine - induced e ##osi ##no ##phi ##l im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in the lungs upon sar ##s - co ##v infection could be avoided by the t ##lr ago ##nist ad ##ju ##vant ##s . importance inactivated whole severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) vaccines induce neutral ##izing antibodies in mouse models ; however , they also cause increased e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology in the lungs upon sar ##s - co ##v challenge . in this study , the ability of ad ##ju ##vant
the engineering of a full - length infectious cd ##na clone and a functional rep ##lic ##on of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) urban ##i strain as bacterial artificial chromosomes ( ba ##cs ) is described in this study . in this system , the viral rna was expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cy ##tom ##ega ##lov ##irus promoter and further amplified in the cy ##top ##las ##m by the viral replica ##se . both the infectious clone and the rep ##lic ##on were fully stable in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . using the sar ##s - co ##v rep ##lic ##on , we have shown that the recently described rna - processing enzymes ex ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se , end ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se , and 2 ′ - o - rib ##ose methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se were essential for efficient corona ##virus rna synthesis . the sar ##s reverse genetic system developed as a ba ##c constitutes a useful tool for the study of fundamental viral processes and also for developing genetically defined vaccines .  
defining prospective pathways by which zoo ##nos ##es evolve and emerge as human pathogen ##s is critical for anticipating and controlling both natural and deliberate pan ##de ##mics . however , predicting ten ##able pathways of animal - to - human movement has been hind ##ered by challenges in identifying reservoir species , cult ##ivating zoo ##not ##ic organisms in culture , and iso ##lating full - length genome ##s for cl ##oning and genetic studies . the ability to design and recover pathogen ##s rec ##ons ##tituted from synthesized cd ##nas has the potential to overcome these obstacles by allowing studies of replication and pathogen ##esis without identification of reservoir species or cultivation of primary isolate ##s . here , we report the design , synthesis , and recovery of the largest synthetic replica ##ting life form , a 29 . 7 - kb bat severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like corona ##virus ( bat - sc ##ov ) , a likely pro ##gen ##itor to the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic . to test a possible route of emergence from the non ##cu ##lt ##iva ##ble bat - sc ##ov to human sar ##s - co ##v , we designed a consensus bat - sc ##ov genome and replaced the bat - sc ##ov spike receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) with the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d ( bat - sr ##b ##d ) . bat - sr ##b ##d was infectious in cell culture and in mice and was efficiently neutral ##ized by antibodies specific for both bat and human co ##v spike proteins . rational design , synthesis , and recovery of hypothetical rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses can be used to investigate mechanisms of trans ##sp ##ec ##ies movement of zoo ##nos ##es and has great potential to aid in rapid public health responses to known or predicted emerging micro ##bial threats .  
corona ##virus ##es can cause respiratory and enter ##ic disease in a wide variety of human and animal hosts . the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus infections in humans . in 2012 , a similar previously unknown corona ##virus emerged , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , thus far causing over 650 laboratory - confirmed infections , with an une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months . the human mer ##s fatal ##ity rate of [UNK] % is alarm ##ingly high , even though many deaths were associated with underlying medical conditions . registered therapeutic ##s for the treatment of corona ##virus infections are not available . moreover , the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases . therefore , we have screened a library of 34 ##8 fda - approved drugs for anti - mer ##s - co ##v activity in cell culture . if such compounds proved sufficiently potent , their efficacy might be directly assessed in mer ##s patients . we identified four compounds ( ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine , lo ##per ##ami ##de , and lo ##pina ##vir ) inhibit ##ing mer ##s - co ##v replication in the low - micro ##mo ##lar range ( 50 % effective concentrations [ ec ( 50 ) s ] , 3 to 8 μ ##m ) . moreover , these compounds also inhibit the replication of sar ##s corona ##virus and human corona ##virus 229 ##e . although their protective activity ( alone or in combination ) remains to be assessed in animal models , our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es like mer ##s - co ##v . although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low levels , a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune response .  
zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es , including the one that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , cause significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in humans . no specific therapy for any human corona ##virus is available , making vaccine development critical for protection against these viruses . we previously showed that rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ( urban ##i strain based ) lacking envelope ( e ) protein expression ( ru - δ ##e ) provided good but not perfect protection in young mice against challenge with vi ##ru ##lent mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v ( ma ##15 ) . to improve vaccine efficacy , we developed a second set of e - deleted vaccine candidates on an ma ##15 background ( rm ##a1 ##5 - δ ##e ) . rm ##a1 ##5 - δ ##e is safe , causing no disease in 6 - week - , 12 - month - , or 18 - month - old bal ##b / c mice . im ##mun ##ization with this virus completely protected mice of three ages from lethal disease and effect ##ed more - rapid virus clearance . compared to ru - δ ##e , rm ##a1 ##5 - δ ##e im ##mun ##ization resulted in significantly greater neutral ##izing antibody and sar ##s - co ##v - specific cd ##4 and cd ##8 t cell responses . after challenge , inflammatory cell in ##filtration , ed ##ema , and lung destruction were decreased in the lungs of rm ##a1 ##5 - δ ##e - im ##mun ##ized mice compared to those in ru - δ ##e - im ##mun ##ized 12 - month - old mice . collectively , these results show that im ##mun ##ization with a species - adapted at ##ten ##uated corona ##virus lacking e protein expression is safe and provides optimal im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and long - term protection against challenge with lethal virus . this approach will be generally useful for development of vaccines protective against human corona ##virus ##es as well as against corona ##virus ##es that cause disease in domestic and companion animals .  
the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a previously unidentified corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) of sar ##s - co ##v plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti - sar ##s therapy . there is a lack of structural or bio ##chemical data on any corona ##virus polymer ##ase . to provide insights into the structure and function of sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp , we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all rd ##rp ##s , and built a three - dimensional model of the catalytic domain . the structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes . we predict important structural attributes of potential anti - sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp nu ##cle ##otide analog inhibitors : hydrogen - bonding capability for the 2 ′ and 3 ′ groups of the sugar ring and c ##3 ′ end ##o sugar puck ##ering , and the absence of a hydro ##phobic binding pocket for non - nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis c virus rd ##rp and human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus type 1 reverse transcript ##ase . we propose that the clinical ##ly observed resistance of sar ##s to rib ##avi ##rin is probably due to per ##tur ##bation of the conserved motif a that controls rn ##tp binding and fidelity of polymer ##ization . our results suggest that designing anti - sar ##s the ##ra ##pies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other anti ##vira ##l drugs . this work should also provide guidance for future bio ##chemical experiments .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome . ve ##ro ##e ##6 cells , fetal r ##hes ##us monkey kidney cells , and human peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells were the only cells known to be susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v . we developed a multiple ##x reverse transcription - pc ##r ass ##ay to analyze the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of cells derived from a variety of tissues and species to sar ##s - co ##v . additionally , productive infection was determined by ti ##tra ##tion of cellular super ##nat ##ants . cells derived from three species of monkey were susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v . however , the levels of sar ##s - co ##v produced differed by 4 log ( 10 ) . min ##k lung ep ##ith ##elial cells ( mv ##1 ##lu ) and r - mix , a mixed mono ##layer of human lung - derived cells ( a ##54 ##9 ) and min ##k lung - derived cells ( mv ##1 ##lu ) , are used by diagnostic laboratories to detect respiratory viruses ( e . g . , influenza virus ) ; they were also infected with sar ##s - co ##v , indicating that the practices of diagnostic laboratories should be examined to ensure appropriate bio ##sa ##fe ##ty precautions . mv ##1 ##lu cells produce little sar ##s - co ##v compared to that produced by ve ##ro ##e ##6 cells , which indicates that they are a safer alternative for sar ##s - co ##v diagnostic ##s . evaluation of cells per ##missive to other corona ##virus ##es indicated that these cell types are not infected by sar ##s - co ##v , providing additional evidence that sar ##s - co ##v binds an alternative receptor . analysis of human cells derived from lung , kidney , liver , and int ##est ##ine led to the discovery that human cell lines were productive ##ly infected by sar ##s - co ##v . this study identifies new cell lines that may be used for sar ##s - co ##v diagnostic ##s and / or basic research . our data and other in vivo studies indicate that sar ##s - co ##v has a wide host range , suggesting that the cellular receptor ( s ) utilized by sar ##s - co ##v is highly conserved and is expressed by a variety of tissues .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a highly lethal pneumonia . mer ##s was recently identified as a candidate for vaccine development but most efforts focus on antibody responses , which are often transient after co ##v infections . co ##v - specific t cells are generally long - lived but the virus - specific t cell response has not been addressed in mer ##s patients . here , we obtained p ##bm ##cs and / or sera from 21 mer ##s survivors . we detected mer ##s - co ##v - specific cd ##4 and cd ##8 t cell responses in all mer ##s survivors and demonstrated functionality by measuring cy ##tok ##ine expression after peptide stimulation . neutral ##izing ( pr ##nt ( 50 ) ) antibody ti ##ters measured in vitro predicted serum protective ability in infected mice and correlated with cd ##4 but not cd ##8 t cell responses ; patients with higher pr ##nt ( 50 ) and cd ##4 t cell responses had longer ic ##u stays and prolonged virus shed ##ding and required ventilation . survivors with und ##ete ##ctable mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibody responses mounted cd ##8 t cell responses comparable to those of the whole co ##hort . there were no correlation ##s between age , disease severity , co - mor ##bid ##ities and virus - specific cd ##8 t cell responses . in conclusion , measurements of mer ##s - co ##v - specific t cell responses may be useful for predicting pro ##gno ##sis , monitoring vaccine efficacy and identifying mer ##s patients with mild disease in ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies and will complement virus - specific antibody measurements .  
we report the discovery and optimization of a potent inhibitor against the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) from the corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . this unique pro ##tea ##se is not only responsible for processing the viral poly ##pro ##tein into its functional units but is also capable of cl ##ea ##ving u ##bi ##qui ##tin and is ##g ##15 con ##ju ##gate ##s and plays a significant role in helping sar ##s - co ##v evade the human immune system . we screened a structurally diverse library of 50 , 08 ##0 compounds for inhibitors of pl ##pro and discovered a non ##co ##valent lead inhibitor with an ic ( 50 ) value of 20 μ ##m , which was improved to 600 nm via synthetic optimization . the resulting compound , gr ##l ##0 ##6 ##17 , inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v viral replication in ve ##ro e ##6 cells with an ec ( 50 ) of 15 μ ##m and had no associated cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city . the x - ray structure of pl ##pro in complex with gr ##l ##0 ##6 ##17 indicates that the compound has a unique mode of inhibition whereby it binds within the s ##4 - s ##3 sub ##sit ##es of the enzyme and induce ##s a loop closure that shut ##s down cat ##aly ##sis at the active site . these findings provide proof - of - principle that pl ##pro is a viable target for development of anti ##vira ##ls directed against sar ##s - co ##v , and that potent non ##co ##valent cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se inhibitors can be developed with specific ##ity directed toward pathogen ##ic de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzymes without inhibit ##ing host dub ##s .  
many viral fusion proteins are prime ##d by pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage near their fusion peptide ##s . while the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spike ( s ) protein is known to be cl ##ea ##ved at the s ##1 / s ##2 boundary , this cleavage site is not closely linked to a fusion peptide . however , a second cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) s ##2 domain ( r ##7 ##9 ##7 ) . here , we investigated whether this internal cleavage of s ##2 expose ##s a viral fusion peptide . we show that the residues immediately c - terminal to the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 cleavage site sf ##ied ##ll ##f ##nk ##v ##tl ##ada ##gf are very highly conserved across all co ##vs . mu ##tage ##nes ##is studies of these residues in sar ##s - co ##v s , followed by cell - cell fusion and pseudo ##type ##d vi ##rion in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ays , showed a critical role for residues l ##80 ##3 , l ##80 ##4 , and f ##80 ##5 in membrane fusion . mutation of the most n - terminal residue ( s ##7 ##9 ##8 ) had little or no effect on membrane fusion . bio ##chemical analyses of synthetic peptide ##s corresponding to the proposed s ##2 fusion peptide also showed an important role for this region in membrane fusion and indicated the presence of α - he ##lica ##l structure . we propose that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage within s ##2 expose ##s a novel internal fusion peptide for sar ##s - co ##v s , which may be conserved across the corona ##vir ##idae .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) currently spreads in humans and causes [UNK] % fatal ##ity in infected patients . believed to have originated from bats , mer ##s - co ##v is genetically related to bat corona ##virus ##es hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 . to understand how bat corona ##virus ##es transmit to humans , we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus - surface spike proteins of hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 . we found that dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , the receptor for mer ##s - co ##v , is also the receptor for hk ##u ##4 , but not hk ##u ##5 . despite sharing a common receptor , mer ##s - co ##v and hk ##u ##4 spikes demonstrated functional differences . first , whereas mer ##s - co ##v prefers human d ##pp ##4 over bat d ##pp ##4 as its receptor , hk ##u ##4 shows the opposite trend . second , in the absence of ex ##ogen ##ous pro ##tea ##ses , both mer ##s - co ##v and hk ##u ##4 spikes media ##te pseudo ##virus entry into bat cells , whereas only mer ##s - co ##v spike , but not hk ##u ##4 spike , media ##tes pseudo ##virus entry into human cells . thus , mer ##s - co ##v , but not hk ##u ##4 , has adapted to use human d ##pp ##4 and human cellular pro ##tea ##ses for efficient human cell entry , contributing to the enhanced pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v in humans . these results establish d ##pp ##4 as a functional receptor for hk ##u ##4 and host cellular pro ##tea ##ses as a host range deter ##mina ##nt for hk ##u ##4 . they also suggest that d ##pp ##4 - recognizing bat corona ##virus ##es threaten human health because of their spikes ’ capability to adapt to human cells for cross - species transmissions .  
in 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused one of the most devastating epidemic ##s known to the developed world . there were two important lessons from this epidemic . firstly , corona ##virus ##es , in addition to influenza viruses , can cause severe and rapidly spreading human infections . secondly , bats can serve as the origin and natural animal reservoir of deadly human viruses . since then , researchers around the world , especially those in asia where sar ##s - co ##v was first identified , have turned their focus to find novel corona ##virus ##es in ##fect ##ing humans , bats , and other animals . two human corona ##virus ##es , hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 and hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , were identified shortly after the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic as common causes of human respiratory tract infections . in 2012 , a novel human corona ##virus , now called middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has emerged in the middle east to cause fatal human infections in three continents . mer ##s - co ##v human infection is similar to sar ##s - co ##v in having a high fatal ##ity rate and the ability to spread from person to person which resulted in secondary cases among close contacts including healthcare workers without travel history to the middle east . both viruses also have close relationships with bat corona ##virus ##es . new cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans continue to occur with the origins of the virus still unknown in many cases . a multi ##face ##ted approach is necessary to control this evolving mer ##s - co ##v outbreak . source identification requires detailed ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies of the infected patients and enhanced surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v or similar corona ##virus ##es in humans and animals . early diagnosis of infected patients and appropriate infection control measures will limit the spread in hospitals , while social di ##stan ##cing strategies may be necessary to control the outbreak in communities if it remained un ##con ##tro ##lled as in the sar ##s epidemic .  
aim : to study whether severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) could be ex ##cre ##ted from digest ##ive system . methods : cell culture and semi - nest ##ed rt - pc ##r were used to detect sar ##s - co ##v and its rna from 21 stool and urine samples , and a kind of electro ##po ##sit ##ive filter media particles was used to concentrate the virus in 10 sewage samples from two hospitals receiving sar ##s patients in beijing in china . results : it was demonstrated that there was no live sar ##s - co ##v in all samples collected , but the rna of sar ##s - co ##v could be detected in seven stool samples from sar ##s patients with any one of the symptoms of fever , mala ##ise , cough , or d ##ys ##p ##nea , in 10 sewage samples before di ##sin ##fect ##ion and 3 samples after di ##sin ##fect ##ion from the two hospitals . the rna could not be detected in urine and stool samples from patients recovered from sar ##s . conclusion : nuclei ##c acid of sar ##s - co ##v can be ex ##cre ##ted through the stool of patients into sewage system , and the possibility of sar ##s - co ##v transmitting through digest ##ive system cannot be excluded .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) assemble by bud ##ding into the lu ##men of the early go ##l ##gi complex prior to ex ##oc ##yt ##osis . the small co ##v envelope ( e ) protein plays roles in assembly , vi ##rion release , and pathogen ##esis . co ##v e has a single hydro ##phobic domain ( hd ) , is targeted to go ##l ##gi complex membranes , and has cat ##ion channel activity in vitro . however , the precise functions of the co ##v e protein during infection are still enigma ##tic . structural data for the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v e protein suggest that it assemble ##s into a homo ##pen ##tam ##er . specific residues in the hd regulate the ion - conducting por ##e formed by sar ##s - co ##v e in artificial bi ##layer ##s and the pathogen ##ici ##ty of the virus during infection . the e protein from the av ##ian infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) has dramatic effects on the secret ##ory system which require residues in the hd . here , we use the known structural data from sar ##s - co ##v e to in ##fer the residues important for ion channel activity and the ol ##igo ##mer ##ization of ib ##v e . we present bio ##chemical data for the formation of two distinct ol ##igo ##meric pools of ib ##v e in trans ##fect ##ed and infected cells and the residues required for their formation . a high - order ol ##igo ##mer of ib ##v e is required for the production of virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) , imp ##lica ##ting this form of the protein in vi ##rion assembly . additionally , disruption of the secret ##ory pathway by ib ##v e co ##rre ##lates with a form that is likely mono ##meric , suggesting that the effects on the secret ##ory pathway are independent of e ion channel activity . importance co ##vs are important human pathogen ##s with significant zoo ##not ##ic potential , as demonstrated by the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v . progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates in mouse models of co ##v infection , including the use of at ##ten ##uated viruses that lack the co ##v e protein or express e - protein mutants . however , no approved vaccines or anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s exist . we previously reported that the hydro ##phobic domain of the ib ##v e protein , a put ##ative vi ##rop ##orin , causes disruption of the mammalian secret ##ory pathway when ex ##ogen ##ously expressed in cells . understanding the mechanism of this disruption could lead to the identification of novel anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s . here , we present bio ##chemical evidence for two distinct ol ##igo ##meric forms of ib
the recently discovered middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to in ##fect humans , with high mortality . specific , highly effective therapeutic ##s and vaccines against the mer ##s - co ##v are urgently needed to save human lives and address the pan ##de ##mic concerns . we identified three human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) , m3 ##36 , m3 ##37 , and m3 ##38 , targeting the receptor ( cd ##26 / d ##pp ##4 ) binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein from a very large naive - antibody library ( containing [UNK] ( 11 ) antibodies ) . they bound with high affinity : equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant ##s for the three mab ##s were equal to 4 . 2 , 9 . 3 , and 15 nm , respectively , as measured by bi ##aco ##re for fa ##bs binding to rb ##d . the avid ##ity for i ##gg ##1 m3 ##36 , m3 ##37 , and m3 ##38 was even higher : 99 , 820 , and 560 pm , respectively . the antibodies bound to overlapping ep ##ito ##pes that overlap the receptor binding site on the rb ##d as suggested by competition experiments and further supported by site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is of the rb ##d and a docking model of the m3 ##36 - rb ##d complex . the highest - affinity mab , m3 ##36 , neutral ##ized both pseudo ##type ##d and live mer ##s - co ##v with exceptional pot ##ency , 50 % neutral ##ization at 0 . 00 ##5 and 0 . 07 μ ##g / ml , respectively , likely by competing with d ##pp ##4 for binding to the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . the exceptionally high neutral ##ization activity of these antibodies and especially m3 ##36 suggests that they have great potential for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and therapy of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans and as a tool for development of vaccine im ##mun ##ogen ##s . the rapid identification ( within several weeks ) of potent mab ##s suggests a possibility to use the new large antibody library and related methodology for a quick response to the public threat resulting from emerging corona ##virus ##es . importance a novel human corona ##virus , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , was found to in ##fect humans with a high mortality rate in 2012 , just 1 decade after the appearance of the first highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . there are no effective therapeutic ##s available . it is highly desirable to find an approach for rapidly developing potent therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v , which not only can be implemented for mer ##s
human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) were selected from semi ##sy ##nt ##hetic antibody ph ##age display libraries by using whole ir ##rad ##iated severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) vi ##rion ##s as target . we identified eight human mab ##s binding to virus and infected cells , six of which could be mapped to two sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins : the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and spike ( s ) proteins . two mab ##s reacted with n protein . one of the n protein mab ##s recognized a linear ep ##ito ##pe conserved between all published human and animal sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , and the other bound to a nonlinear n ep ##ito ##pe . these two n mab ##s did not compete for binding to sar ##s - co ##v . four mab ##s reacted with the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , and three of these mab ##s neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v in vitro . all three neutral ##izing anti - s mab ##s bound a rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##1 fragment comprising residues 318 to 510 , a region previously identified as the sar ##s - co ##v s receptor binding domain ; the non ##ne ##ut ##ral ##izing mab did not . two strongly neutral ##izing anti - s ##1 mab ##s blocked the binding of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt s fragment ( residues 1 to 56 ##5 ) to sar ##s - co ##v - susceptible ve ##ro cells completely , whereas a poorly neutral ##izing s ##1 mab blocked binding only partially . the mab ability to block s ##1 - receptor binding and the level of neutral ##ization of the two strongly neutral ##izing s ##1 mab ##s correlated with the binding affinity to the s ##1 domain . finally , ep ##ito ##pe mapping , using rec ##om ##bina ##nt s fragments ( residues 318 to 510 ) containing naturally occurring mutations , revealed the importance of residue n ##47 ##9 for the binding of the most potent neutral ##izing mab , cr ##30 ##14 . the complete set of sar ##s - co ##v mab ##s described here may be useful for diagnosis , che ##mo ##pro ##phy ##la ##xi ##s , and therapy of sar ##s - co ##v infection and disease .  
the spike ( s ) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays important roles in viral pathogen ##esis and potentially in the development of an effective vaccine against this vi ##ru ##lent infectious disease . in this study , the cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed s gene of sar ##s - co ##v was synthesized to construct dna vaccine pl ##as ##mi ##ds expressing either the full - length or segments of the s protein . high ti ##ter s - specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g antibody responses were eli ##cite ##d in rabbits im ##mun ##ized with dna against various segments of the s protein . two neutral ##izing domains were identified on the s protein , one at the n terminus ( ser ##12 - th ##r ##53 ##5 ) and the other near the c terminus ( ar ##g ##7 ##9 ##7 - ile ##11 ##9 ##2 ) .  
corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection of humans is usually not associated with severe disease . however , discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v revealed that highly pathogen ##ic human co ##vs ( hc ##ov ##s ) can evolve . the identification and characterization of new hc ##ov ##s is , therefore , an important task . recently , a hc ##ov termed nl ##6 ##3 was discovered in patients with respiratory tract illness . here , cell tr ##op ##ism and receptor usage of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 were analyzed . the nl ##6 ##3 spike ( s ) protein mediated infection of different target cells compared with the closely related 229 ##e - s protein but facilitated entry into cells known to be per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v - s - driven infection . an analysis of receptor engagement revealed that nl ##6 ##3 - s binds ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ( ace ) 2 , the receptor for sar ##s - co ##v , and hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 uses ace ##2 as a receptor for infection of target cells . potent neutral ##izing activity directed against nl ##6 ##3 - but not 229 ##e - s protein was detected in virtually all sera from patients 8 years of age or older , suggesting that hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 infection of humans is common and usually acquired during childhood . here , we show that sar ##s - co ##v shares its receptor ace ##2 with hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 . because the two viruses differ dramatically in their ability to induce disease , analysis of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 might un ##rave ##l pathogen ##ici ##ty factors in sar ##s - co ##v . the frequent hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 infection of humans suggests that highly pathogen ##ic variants have ample opportunity to evolve , under ##lining the need for vaccines against hc ##ov ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a highly lethal pulmonary infection with [UNK] % mortality . the potential for a future pan ##de ##mic originating from animal reservoirs or health care - associated events is a major public health concern . there are no vaccines or therapeutic agents currently available for mer ##s - co ##v . using a probe - based single b cell cl ##oning strategy , we have identified and characterized multiple neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) specifically binding to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) or s ##1 ( non - rb ##d ) regions from a con ##vale ##scent mer ##s - co ##v - infected patient and from im ##mun ##ized r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues . rb ##d - specific mab ##s tended to have greater neutral ##izing pot ##ency than non - rb ##d s ##1 - specific mab ##s . six rb ##d - specific and five s ##1 - specific mab ##s could be sorted into four rb ##d and three non - rb ##d distinct binding patterns , based on competition ass ##ays , mapping neutral ##ization escape variants , and structural analysis . we determined co ##cr ##yst ##al structures for two mab ##s targeting the rb ##d from different angles and show they can bind the rb ##d only in the “ out ” position . we then showed that selected rb ##d - specific , non - rb ##d s ##1 - specific , and s ##2 - specific mab ##s given prop ##hyl ##actic ##ally prevented mer ##s - co ##v replication in lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge . importantly , combining rb ##d - and non - rb ##d mab ##s delayed the emergence of escape mutations in a cell - based virus escape ass ##ay . these studies identify mab ##s targeting different antigen ##ic sites on s that will be useful for defining mechanisms of mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##ization and for developing more effective interventions to prevent or treat mer ##s - co ##v infections . importance mer ##s - co ##v causes a highly lethal respiratory infection for which no vaccines or anti ##vira ##l therapeutic options are currently available . based on continuing exposure from established reservoirs in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and bats , transmission of mer ##s - co ##v into humans and future outbreak ##s are expected . using structurally defined probe ##s for the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) , the target for neutral ##izing antibodies , single b cells were sorted from a con ##vale ##scent human and im ##mun ##ized non ##hum ##an primate ##s ( nh ##ps ) . mab ##s produced from paired im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin gene sequences were mapped to multiple ep ##ito ##pes within and outside the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d )
sar ##s - co ##v from the corona ##vir ##idae family has been identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a highly con ##tag ##ious upper respiratory disease that reached epidemic status in 2002 . sar ##s - 3 ##cl ( pro ) , a cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se ind ##is ##pen ##sible to the viral life cycle , has been identified as one of the key therapeutic target against sar ##s . a combined ligand and structure based virtual screening was carried out against the as ##ine ##x platinum collection . multiple low micro ##mo ##lar inhibitors of the enzyme were identified through this search , one of which also showed activity against sar ##s - co ##v in a whole cell cp ##e ass ##ay . furthermore , multi nano ##se ##con ##d explicit solvent simulations were carried out using the docking poses of the identified hits to study the overall stability of the binding site interactions as well as identify important changes in the interaction profile that were not apparent from the docking study . cumulative analysis of the evaluated compounds and the simulation studies led to the identification of certain protein - ligand interaction patterns which would be useful in further structure based design efforts .  
we present here a rapid im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic ass ##ay for the detection of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) antigen in the nasal sw ##ab ##s of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . the ass ##ay is based on the detection of mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in a short time frame using highly selective mono ##cl ##onal antibodies at room temperature . the relative sensitivity and specific ##ity of the ass ##ay were found to be 93 . 90 % and 100 % , respectively , compared to that of the up ##e and open reading frame 1a ( or ##f ##1 ##a ) real - time reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) . the results suggest that the ass ##ay developed here is a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s .  
using paired serum samples obtained from patients with illness associated with increases in anti - human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) or anti - hc ##ov - 229 ##e antibodies , we examined the possibility of false - positive results detected in a rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . three of the 21 and 1 of the 7 con ##vale ##scent - phase serum samples from persons with increases in antibodies against hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and hc ##ov - 229 ##e , respectively , tested positive by the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein - based elisa . none of these samples were found to contain a specific antibody in the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v spike poly ##pe ##pt ##ide - based western b ##lot ass ##ay .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , resulted in substantial mor ##bid ##ity , mortality , and economic losses during the 2003 epidemic . while sar ##s - co ##v infection has not rec ##ur ##red to a significant extent since 2003 , it still remains a potential threat . understanding of sar ##s and development of therapeutic approaches have been hampered by the absence of an animal model that mimic ##s the human disease and is rep ##rod ##ucible . here we show that trans ##genic mice that express the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 [ ha ##ce ##2 ] ) in air ##way and other ep ##ith ##elia develop a rapidly lethal infection after intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation with a human strain of the virus . infection begins in air ##way ep ##ith ##elia , with subsequent al ##ve ##olar involvement and extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry virus spread to the brain . infection results in macro ##pha ##ge and l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte in ##filtration in the lungs and up ##re ##gul ##ation of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es in both the lung and the brain . this model of lethal infection with sar ##s - co ##v should be useful for studies of pathogen ##esis and for the development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies .  
although the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) epidemic was controlled by non ##vac ##cine measures , corona ##virus ##es remain a major threat to human health . the design of optimal corona ##virus vaccines therefore remains a priority . such vaccines present major challenges : corona ##virus immunity often wan ##es rapidly , individuals needing to be protected include the elderly , and vaccines may ex ##ace ##rba ##te rather than prevent corona ##virus lung im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . to address these issues , we compared in a mu ##rine model a range of rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike protein or inactivated whole - virus vaccine candidates alone or ad ##ju ##vant ##ed with either al ##um , cp ##g , or ad ##va ##x , a new delta in ##ulin - based poly ##sa ##cc ##hari ##de ad ##ju ##vant . while all vaccines protected against lethal infection , addition of ad ##ju ##vant significantly increased serum neutral ##izing - antibody ti ##ters and reduced lung virus ti ##ters on day 3 post ##chal ##len ##ge . whereas una ##d ##ju ##vant ##ed or al ##um - formulated vaccines were associated with significantly increased lung e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology on day 6 post ##chal ##len ##ge , this was not seen in mice im ##mun ##ized with vaccines formulated with delta in ##ulin ad ##ju ##vant . protection against e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology by vaccines containing delta in ##ulin ad ##ju ##vant ##s correlated better with enhanced t - cell gamma inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - γ ) recall responses rather than reduced inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 ( il - 4 ) responses , suggesting that im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology predominantly reflects an inadequate vaccine - induced th ##1 response . this study highlights the critical importance for development of effective and safe corona ##virus vaccines of selection of ad ##ju ##vant ##s based on the ability to induce durable if ##n - γ responses . importance corona ##virus ##es such as sar ##s - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cause high case fatal ##ity rates and remain major human public health threats , creating a need for effective vaccines . while corona ##virus antigen ##s that induce protective neutral ##izing antibodies have been identified , corona ##virus vaccines present a unique problem in that im ##mun ##ized individuals when infected by virus can develop lung e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic pathology , a problem that is further ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by the formulation of sar ##s - co ##v vaccines with al ##um ad ##ju ##vant ##s . this study shows that formulation of sar ##s - co ##v spike protein or inactivated whole - virus vaccines with novel delta in ##ulin - based poly ##sa ##cc ##hari ##de ad ##ju ##vant ##s enhance ##s neutral
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes a respiratory disease with a mortality rate of 10 % . a mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v - ma ##15 ) lacking the envelope ( e ) protein ( rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - δ ##e ) is at ##ten ##uated in vivo . to identify e protein regions and host responses that contribute to rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - δ ##e at ##ten ##uation , several mutants ( rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - e * ) containing point mutations or del ##eti ##ons in the amino - terminal or the car ##box ##y - terminal regions of the e protein were generated . amino acid substitution ##s in the amino terminus , or del ##eti ##on of regions in the internal car ##box ##y - terminal region of e protein , led to virus at ##ten ##uation . at ##ten ##uated viruses induced minimal lung injury , diminished limited ne ##ut ##rop ##hil influx , and increased cd ##4 ( + ) and cd ##8 ( + ) t cell counts in the lungs of bal ##b / c mice , compared to mice infected with the wild - type virus . to analyze the host responses leading to rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - e * at ##ten ##uation , differences in gene expression eli ##cite ##d by the native and mutant viruses in the lungs of infected mice were determined . expression levels of a large number of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines associated with lung injury were reduced in the lungs of rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - e * - infected mice , whereas the levels of anti - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines were increased , both at the mrna and protein levels . these results suggested that the reduction in lung inflammation together with a more robust anti ##vira ##l t cell response contributed to rs ##ars - co ##v - ma ##15 - e * at ##ten ##uation . the at ##ten ##uated viruses completely protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus , indicating that these viruses are promising vaccine candidates . importance human corona ##virus ##es are important zoo ##not ##ic pathogen ##s . sar ##s - co ##v caused a worldwide epidemic in ##fect ##ing more than 8 , 000 people with a mortality of around 10 % . therefore , understanding the vi ##ru ##lence mechanisms of this pathogen and developing e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccines are of high importance to prevent epidemic ##s from this and other human corona ##virus ##es . previously , we demonstrated that a sar ##s - co ##v lacking the e protein was at ##ten ##uated in vivo . here , we show that small del ##eti ##ons and modifications within the e protein led to virus at
a new human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v , was first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 . in response , we developed two real - time reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) ass ##ays targeting the mer ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) gene and evaluated these ass ##ays as a panel with a previously published ass ##ay targeting the region upstream of the mer ##s - co ##v envelope gene ( up ##e ) for the detection and confirmation of mer ##s - co ##v infection . all ass ##ays detected ≤ ##10 copies / reaction of quan ##ti ##fied rna transcript ##s , with a linear dynamic range of 8 log units and 1 . 3 × 10 ( − ##3 ) 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive doses ( tc ##id ( 50 ) ) / ml of culture ##d mer ##s - co ##v per reaction . all ass ##ays performed com ##para ##bly with respiratory , serum , and stool specimens spiked with culture ##d virus . no false - positive amp ##li ##fication ##s were obtained with other human corona ##virus ##es or common respiratory viral pathogen ##s or with 336 diverse clinical specimens from non - mer ##s - co ##v cases ; specimens from two confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases were positive with all ass ##ay signatures . in june 2012 , the u . s . food and drug administration authorized emergency use of the rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ay panel as an in vitro diagnostic test for mer ##s - co ##v . a kit consisting of the three ass ##ay signatures and a positive control was assembled and distributed to public health laboratories in the united states and internationally to support mer ##s - co ##v surveillance and public health responses .  
a comb ##inator ##ial human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin gene library was constructed from the peripheral l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes of two patients who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the library was screened for the production of fa ##b antibody fragments to a rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . one fa ##b clone , as ##3 - 3 , reacted with the spike protein in an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . the di ##sso ##ciation constant of as ##3 - 3 was 1 . 98 × 10 ( − ##8 ) m . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent microscopy revealed that it reacted with sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . the library seems to be a potent tool for the production of human antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v .  
the new severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , described in february 2003 , infected a total of 8 , 43 ##9 people . a total of 81 ##2 people died due to respiratory ins ##uf ##fi ##ciency . close contact with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic patients appeared to be the main route of transmission . however , potential transmission by blood trans ##fusion could not be definitely excluded . two real - time sar ##s - specific pc ##r ass ##ays were assessed for their sen ##sit ##iv ##ities , agreement of test results , and intra - ass ##ay var ##ia ##bilities . both ass ##ays rely on reverse transcription and amp ##li ##fication of extracted rna . dil ##ution ##s of gamma - ir ##rad ##iated cell culture super ##nat ##ants of sar ##s co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells were prepared to determine the precision ##s , linear ranges , and acc ##ura ##cies of the ass ##ays . the linear range for the art ##us real ##art hp ##a - corona ##virus ass ##ay ( art ##us ass ##ay ) was 1 × 10 ( 2 ) to 1 × 10 ( 7 ) copies / ml , and that for the roche light ##cycle ##r sar ##s co ##v quan ##ti ##fication kit ( roche ass ##ay ) was 1 × 10 ( 4 ) to 2 × 10 ( 8 ) copies / ml . the detection limit of the roche ass ##ay was 3 , 98 ##2 . 1 copies / ml , whereas that of the art ##us ass ##ay was 37 . 8 copies / ml . detection limits were calculated with a standard preparation that was recommended for use by the world health organization . however , quan ##ti ##fication of co ##v in this preparation may be imp ##re ##cise . in summary , both ass ##ays are suitable for quantitative measurement of sar ##s co ##v at the high concentrations expected in sp ##ut ##um samples . the art ##us ass ##ay is also suitable for detection of sar ##s co ##v at the low concentrations found in serum samples .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerging highly pathogen ##ic virus causing almost 50 % lethal ##ity in infected individuals . the development of a small - animal model is critical for the understanding of this virus and to aid in development of counter ##me ##as ##ures against mer ##s - co ##v . we found that bal ##b / c , 129 / sv ##ev and 129 / sv ##ev stat ##1 knockout mice are not per ##missive to mer ##s - co ##v infection . the lack of infection may be due to the low level of mrna and protein for the mer ##s - co ##v receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , in the lungs of mice . the low level of d ##pp ##4 in the lungs likely contributes to the lack of viral replication in these mouse models and suggests that a trans ##genic mouse model expressing d ##pp ##4 to higher levels is necessary to create a mouse model for mer ##s - co ##v .  
outbreak ##s of emerging infections present health professionals with the unique challenge of trying to select appropriate ph ##arm ##aco ##logic treatments in the clinic with little time available for drug testing and development . typically , clinic ##ians are left with general supportive care and often un ##test ##ed con ##vale ##scent - phase plasma as available treatment options . rep ##ur ##po ##sing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for new indications presents an attractive alternative to clinic ##ians , researchers , public health agencies , drug developers , and funding agencies . given the development times and manufacturing requirements for new products , rep ##ur ##po ##sing of existing drugs is likely the only solution for outbreak ##s due to emerging viruses . in the studies described here , a library of 290 compounds was screened for anti ##vira ##l activity against middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . selection of compounds for inclusion in the library was dependent on current or previous fda approval or advanced clinical development . some drugs that had a well - defined cellular pathway as target were included . in total , 27 compounds with activity against both mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v were identified . the compounds belong to 13 different classes of pharmaceuticals , including inhibitors of est ##rogen receptors used for cancer treatment and inhibitors of do ##pa ##mine receptor used as anti ##psy ##cho ##tics . the drugs identified in these screens provide new targets for in vivo studies as well as incorporation into ongoing clinical studies .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) binds to cellular receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) via the spike ( s ) protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . the rb ##d contains critical neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes and serves as an important vaccine target . since rb ##d mutations occur in different mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s and antibody escape mutants , cross - neutral ##ization of diver ##gent mer ##s - co ##v strains by rb ##d - induced antibodies remains unknown . here , we constructed four rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d ( rr ##b ##d ) proteins with single or multiple mutations detected in representative human mer ##s - co ##v strains from the 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 outbreak ##s , respectively , and one rr ##b ##d protein with multiple changes derived from camel mer ##s - co ##v strains . like the rb ##d of prototype em ##c ##20 ##12 ( em ##c - rb ##d ) , all five rb ##ds maintained good antigen ##ici ##ty and functionality , the ability to bind rb ##d - specific neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) and the d ##pp ##4 receptor , and high im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity , able to eli ##cit s - specific antibodies . they induced potent neutral ##izing antibodies cross - neutral ##izing 17 mer ##s pseudo ##virus ##es expressing s proteins of representative human and camel mer ##s - co ##v strains identified during the 2012 - 2015 outbreak ##s , 5 mab escape mer ##s - co ##v mutants , and 2 live human mer ##s - co ##v strains . we then constructed two rb ##ds mu ##tated in multiple key residues in the receptor - binding motif ( rb ##m ) of rb ##d and demonstrated their strong cross - react ##ivity with anti - em ##c - rb ##d antibodies . these rb ##d mutants with diminished d ##pp ##4 binding also led to virus at ##ten ##uation , suggesting that im ##mun ##oe ##vas ##ion after rb ##d im ##mun ##ization is accompanied by loss of viral fitness . therefore , this study demonstrates that mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d is an important vaccine target able to induce highly potent and broad - spectrum neutral ##izing antibodies against infection by diver ##gent circulating human and camel mer ##s - co ##v strains . importance mer ##s - co ##v was first identified in june 2012 and has since spread in humans and camel ##s . mutations in its spike ( s ) protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , a key vaccine target , have been identified , raising concerns over the efficacy of rb ##d - based mer ##s vaccines against circulating human and camel mer ##s - co ##v strains . here , we constructed five vaccine candidates
the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a major target of protective immunity in vivo . although a large number of neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) have been developed , it remains unclear if a single rb ##d - targeting na ##b or two in combination can prevent neutral ##ization escape and , if not , at ##ten ##uate viral vi ##ru ##lence in vivo . in this study , we used a large panel of human na ##bs against an ep ##ito ##pe that overlap ##s the interface between the rb ##d and its receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , to assess their cross - neutral ##ization activities against a panel of human and zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##vs and neutral ##ization escape mutants . we also investigated the neutral ##ization escape profiles of these na ##bs and evaluated their effects on receptor binding and virus fitness in vitro and in mice . we found that some na ##bs had great pot ##ency and breadth in neutral ##izing multiple viral strains , including neutral ##ization escape viruses derived from other na ##bs ; however , no single na ##b or combination of two blocked neutral ##ization escape . interesting ##ly , in mice the neutral ##ization escape mutant viruses showed either at ##ten ##uation ( urban ##i background ) or increased vi ##ru ##lence ( g ##d ##0 ##3 background ) consistent with the different binding af ##fin ##ities between their rb ##ds and the mouse ace ##2 . we conclude that using either single na ##bs or dual na ##b combinations to target a sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d ep ##ito ##pe that shows plastic ##ity may have limitations for preventing neutral ##ization escape during in vivo im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py . however , rb ##d - directed na ##bs may be useful for providing broad neutral ##ization and prevention of escape variants when combined with other na ##bs that target a second conserved ep ##ito ##pe with less plastic ##ity and more structural constraint . importance the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 has resulted in severe human respiratory disease with high death rates . their zoo ##not ##ic origins highlight the likelihood of re ##eme ##rgen ##ce or further evolution into novel human corona ##virus pathogen ##s . broadly neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) that prevent infection of related viruses represent an important im ##mun ##ost ##rate ##gy for combat ##ing corona ##virus infections ; however , for this strategy to succeed , it is essential to uncover na ##b - mediated escape pathways and to pioneer strategies that prevent escape . here ,
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an important emerging pathogen that was first described in 2012 . while the cell surface receptor for mer ##s - co ##v has been identified as dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , the mouse d ##pp ##4 homo ##logue does not allow virus entry into cells . therefore , development of mouse models of mer ##s - co ##v has been hampered by the fact that mer ##s - co ##v does not replicate in commonly available mouse strains . we have previously described a mouse model in which md ##pp ##4 was replaced with hd ##pp ##4 such that hd ##pp ##4 is expressed under the end ##ogen ##ous md ##pp ##4 promoter . in this study , we used this mouse model to analyze the host response to mer ##s - co ##v infection using im ##mun ##ological ass ##ays and transcript ##ome analysis . de ##ple ##tion of cd ##4 ( + ) t cells , cd ##8 ( + ) t cells , or macro ##pha ##ges has no effect on mer ##s - co ##v replication in the lungs of infected mice . however , we found that de ##ple ##tion of cd ##8 ( + ) t cells protects and de ##ple ##tion of macro ##pha ##ges ex ##ace ##rba ##tes mer ##s - co ##v - induced pathology and clinical symptoms of disease . overall , we demonstrate an important role for the inflammatory response in regulating mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis in vivo . importance the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus that emerged from zoo ##not ##ic sources in 2012 . human infections are still occurring throughout saudi arabia at a 38 % case fatal ##ity rate , with the potential for worldwide spread via air travel . in this work , we identify the host response to the virus and identify inflammatory pathways and cell populations that are critical for protection from severe lung disease . by understanding the immune response to mer ##s - co ##v we can develop targeted the ##ra ##pies to inhibit pathogen ##esis in the future .  
the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) led to a rapid response not only to contain the outbreak but also to identify possible therapeutic interventions , including the generation of human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( hm ##ab ##s ) . human mab ##s may be used therapeutic ##ally without the draw ##backs of chi ##meric or animal abs . several different methods have been used to generate sar ##s - co ##v specific neutral ##izing hm ##ab ##s including the im ##mun ##ization of trans ##genic mice , cl ##oning of small chain variable regions from naive and con ##vale ##scent patients , and the immortal ##ization of con ##vale ##scent b cells . ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of the techniques used , the majority of hm ##ab ##s specifically reacted with the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike ( s ) protein and likely prevented receptor binding . however , several hm ##ab ##s that can bind to ep ##ito ##pes either within the rb ##d , located n terminal of the rb ##d or in the s ##2 domain and neutral ##ize the virus with or without inhibit ##ing receptor binding have been identified . therapeutic utility of hm ##ab ##s has been further el ##uc ##ida ##ted through the identification of potential combinations of hm ##ab ##s that could neutral ##ize viral variants including escape mutants selected using hm ##ab ##s . these results suggest that a cocktail of hm ##ab ##s which can bind to unique ep ##ito ##pes and have different mechanisms of action might be of clinical utility against sar ##s - co ##v infection , and indicate that a similar approach may be applied to treat other viral infections .  
to investigate whether genetic factors of innate immunity might influence su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and / or progression in individuals infected with sar ##s , we evaluated the cd ##14 gene poly ##morphism in 198 hong kong blood donors and 152 hong kong severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) patients who were previously gen ##otype ##d for fc ##γ ##ri ##ia poly ##morphism ##s . the prevalence of the cd ##14 - 159 ##cc poly ##morphism was significantly higher in the patients with severe sar ##s than in the those with mild sar ##s or controls ( 31 % versus 15 % [ mild sar ##s ] or 20 % [ controls ] ; mild sar ##s : p = 0 . 02 ##9 ; odds ratio , 2 . 74 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 15 to 6 . 57 ; controls , p = 0 . 04 ; odds ratio , 2 . 41 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 05 to 5 . 54 ) , and both cd ##14 - 159 ##cc and fc ##γ ##ri ##ia - rr ##13 ##1 are risk gen ##otype ##s for severe sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
the emergence of a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) cat ##aly ##zed the development of rapid diagnostic tests . stool samples have been shown to be appropriate for diagnostic testing for sar ##s co ##v , although it has been recognized to be a het ##ero ##gen ##eous and difficult sample that contains amp ##li ##fication inhibitors . limited information on the efficiency of extraction methods for the purification and concentration of sar ##s co ##v rna from stool samples is available . our study objectives were to determine the optimal extraction method for sar ##s co ##v rna detection and to examine the effect of increased specimen volume for the detection of sar ##s co ##v rna in stool specimens . we conducted a multi ##cent ##er evaluation of four automated and four manual extraction methods using dil ##ution ##s of viral l ##ys ##ate in replicate mock stool samples , followed by quan ##ti ##tation of sar ##s co ##v rna using real - time reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r . the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of the manual methods ranged from 50 % to 100 % , with the cortex bio ##che ##m mag ##az ##or ##b method , a magnetic bea ##d isolation method , allowing detection of all 12 positive samples . the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of the automated methods ranged from 75 % to 100 % . the bio ##merie ##ux nu ##cl ##isen ##s automated extract ##or and mini ##ma ##g extraction methods each had a sensitivity of 100 % . examination of the copy numbers detected and the generation of 10 - fold dil ##ution ##s of the extracted material indicated that a number of extraction methods retained inhibitor ##y substances that prevented optimal amp ##li ##fication . increasing the volume of sample input did improve detection . this information could be useful for the extraction of other rna viruses from stool samples and demonstrates the need to evaluate extraction methods for different specimen types .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes several unique group - specific open reading frames ( or ##fs ) relative to other known corona ##virus ##es . to determine the significance of the sar ##s - co ##v group - specific or ##fs in virus replication in vitro and in mice , we systematically deleted five of the eight group - specific or ##fs , or ##f ##3 ##a , of ##3 ##b , or ##f ##6 , or ##f ##7 ##a , and or ##f ##7 ##b , and characterized rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus replication and gene expression in vitro . del ##eti ##on of the group - specific or ##fs of sar ##s - co ##v , either alone or in various combinations , did not dramatically influence replication efficiency in cell culture or in the levels of viral rna synthesis . the greatest reduction in virus growth was noted following or ##f ##3 ##a del ##eti ##on . sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein does not en ##code a rough end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( re ##r ) / go ##l ##gi retention signal , and it has been suggested that or ##f ##3 ##a interact ##s with and targets s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein retention in the re ##r / go ##l ##gi apparatus . del ##eti ##on of or ##f ##3 ##a did not alter sub ##cellular local ##ization of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein from distinct pun ##ct ##uate local ##ization in the re ##r / go ##l ##gi apparatus . these data suggest that or ##f ##3 ##a plays little role in the targeting of s local ##ization in the re ##r / go ##l ##gi apparatus . in addition , insertion of the 29 - bp del ##eti ##on fu ##sing or ##f ##8 ##a / b into the single or ##f ##8 , noted in early - stage sar ##s - co ##v human and ci ##vet cat isolate ##s , had little if any impact on in vitro growth or rna synthesis . all rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses replicate ##d to wild - type levels in the mu ##rine model , suggesting that either the group - specific or ##fs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for disc ##ern ##ing the role of the group - specific or ##fs in disease origin and development .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic of 2003 was responsible for 77 ##4 deaths and caused significant economic damage worldwide . since july 2003 , a number of sar ##s cases have occurred in china , raising the possibility of future epidemic ##s . we describe here a rapid , sensitive , and highly efficient ass ##ay for the detection of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in culture ##d material and a small number ( n = 7 ) of clinical samples . using rolling circle amp ##li ##fication ( rca ) , we were able to achieve sensitive detection levels of sar ##s - co ##v rna in both solid and liquid phases . the main advantage of rca is that it can be performed under iso ##thermal conditions with minimal re ##age ##nts and avoids the generation of false - positive results , a problem that is frequently encountered in pc ##r - based ass ##ays . furthermore , the rca technology provides a faster , more sensitive , and economical option to currently available pc ##r - based methods .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 and is a highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus . there are no treatment options against mer ##s - co ##v for humans or animals , and there are no large - scale clinical trials for the ##ra ##pies against mer ##s - co ##v . to address this need , we developed an inactivated ra ##bies virus ( ra ##b ##v ) that contains the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein expressed on its surface . our initial rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine , bn ##sp ##33 ##3 - s , expresses a full - length wild - type mer ##s - co ##v s protein ; however , it showed significantly reduced viral ti ##ters compared to those of the parental ra ##b ##v strain and only low - level incorporation of full - length mer ##s - co ##v s into ra ##b ##v particles . therefore , we developed a ra ##b ##v - mer ##s vector that contained the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 domain of the mer ##s - co ##v s protein fused to the ra ##b ##v g protein c terminus ( bn ##sp ##33 ##3 - s ##1 ) . bn ##sp ##33 ##3 - s ##1 grew to ti ##ters similar to those of the parental vaccine vector bn ##sp ##33 ##3 , and the ra ##b ##v g – mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 fusion protein was efficiently expressed and incorporated into ra ##b ##v particles . when we va ##cci ##nated mice , chemical ##ly inactivated bn ##sp ##33 ##3 - s ##1 induced high - ti ##ter neutral ##izing antibodies . next , we challenged both va ##cci ##nated mice and control mice with mer ##s - co ##v after aden ##ov ##irus trans ##duction of the human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) receptor and then analyzed the ability of mice to control mer ##s - co ##v infection . our results demonstrated that va ##cci ##nated mice were fully protected from the mer ##s - co ##v challenge , as indicated by the significantly lower mer ##s - co ##v ti ##ters and mer ##s - co ##v and mrna levels in challenged mice than those in un ##vac ##cina ##ted controls . these data establish that an inactivated ra ##b ##v - mer ##s s - based vaccine may be effective for use in animals and humans in areas where mer ##s - co ##v is endemic . importance ra ##bies virus - based vectors have been proven to be efficient dual vaccines against ra ##bies and emerge ##nt infectious diseases such as e ##bola virus . here we show that inactivated ra ##bies virus particles containing the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 protein induce potent immune responses against mer ##s - co ##v and ra ##b ##v . this novel vaccine
to understand the pathogen ##esis and develop an animal model of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , the frankfurt 1 sar ##s - co ##v isolate was passage ##d serial ##ly in young f ##34 ##4 rats . young rats were susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v but cleared the virus rapidly within 3 to 5 days of intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation . after 10 serial passages , replication and vi ##ru ##lence of sar ##s - co ##v were increased in the respiratory tract of young rats without clinical signs . by contrast , adult rats infected with the passage ##d virus showed respiratory symptoms and severe path ##ological lesions in the lung . levels of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines in sera and lung tissues were significantly higher in adult f ##34 ##4 rats than in young rats . during in vivo passage of sar ##s - co ##v , a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which is known as a sar ##s - co ##v receptor . the rat - passage ##d virus more efficiently infected cho cells expressing rat ace ##2 than did the original isolate . these results strongly indicate that host and virus factors such as advanced age and virus adaptation are critical for the development of sar ##s in rats .  
intra ##nas ##al in ##hala ##tion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) in the im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##ete ##nt mouse strain 129 ##s ##ve ##v resulted in infection of conducting air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells followed by rapid clearance of virus from the lungs and the development of self - limited bro ##nch ##iol ##itis . animals resistant to the effects of inter ##fer ##ons by virtue of a deficiency in stat ##1 demonstrated a markedly different course following intra ##nas ##al in ##hala ##tion of sar ##s co ##v , one characterized by replication of virus in lungs and progressively worse ##ning pulmonary disease with inflammation of small airways and al ##ve ##oli and systemic spread of the virus to liver ##s and sp ##leen ##s .  
how viruses evolve to select their receptor proteins for host cell entry is pu ##zzling . we recently determined the crystal structures of nl ##6 ##3 corona ##virus ( nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v ) and sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) receptor - binding domains ( rb ##ds ) , each complex ##ed with their common receptor , human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) , and proposed the existence of a virus - binding hot spot on ha ##ce ##2 . here we investigated the function of this hypothetical hot spot using structure - guided bio ##chemical and functional ass ##ays . the hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydro ##phobic tunnel walls . mutations that disturb the hot spot structure have significant effects on virus / receptor interactions , revealing critical energy contributions from the hot spot structure . the tunnel structure at the nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v / ha ##ce ##2 interface is more compact than that at the sar ##s - co ##v / ha ##ce ##2 interface , and hence rb ##d / ha ##ce ##2 binding af ##fin ##ities are decreased either by nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v mutations decreasing the tunnel space or by sar ##s - co ##v mutations increasing the tunnel space . furthermore , nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v rb ##d inhibit ##s ha ##ce ##2 - dependent trans ##duction by sar ##s - co ##v spike protein , a successful application of the hot spot theory that has the potential to become a new anti ##vira ##l strategy against sar ##s - co ##v infections . these results suggest that the structural features of the hot spot on ha ##ce ##2 were among the driving forces for the converge ##nt evolution of nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis , and mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges are the key players in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s . in this study , we compared the transcription ##al profiles of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) - infected mono ##cy ##tic cells against that infected by corona ##virus 229 ##e ( co ##v - 229 ##e ) . total rna was extracted from infected dc - sign - trans ##fect ##ed mono ##cytes ( th ##p - 1 - dc - sign ) at 6 and 24 h after infection , and the gene expression was profile ##d in ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide - based micro ##ar ##ray ##s . analysis of immune - related gene expression profiles showed that at 24 h after sar ##s - co ##v infection : ( 1 ) if ##n - α / β - ind ##ucible and cat ##he ##ps ##in / pro ##tea ##some genes were down ##re ##gul ##ated ; ( 2 ) h ##yp ##ox ##ia / hyper ##ox ##ia - related genes were up ##re ##gul ##ated ; and ( 3 ) t ##lr / t ##lr - signaling , cy ##tok ##ine / cy ##tok ##ine receptor - related , che ##mo ##kin ##e / che ##mo ##kin ##e receptor - related , l ##ys ##oso ##me - related , m ##hc / cha ##per ##on - related , and fi ##bro ##sis - related genes were differential ##ly regulated . these results el ##uc ##ida ##te that sar ##s - co ##v infection regulates immune - related genes in mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges , which may be important to the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
foreign viral proteins expressed by ra ##bies virus ( rv ) have been shown to induce potent humor ##al and cellular immune responses in im ##mun ##ized animals . in addition , highly at ##ten ##uated and , therefore , very safe rv - based vectors have been constructed . here , an rv - based vaccine vehicle was utilized as a novel vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . for this approach , the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) or envelope spike protein ( s ) genes were clone ##d between the rv g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein g and polymer ##ase l genes . rec ##om ##bina ##nt vectors expressing sar ##s - co ##v n or s protein were recovered and their im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity was studied in mice . a single in ##oc ##ulation with the rv - based vaccine expressing sar ##s - co ##v s protein induced a strong sar ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing antibody response . the ability of the rv - sar ##s - co ##v s vector to con ##fer immunity after a single in ##oc ##ulation makes this live vaccine a promising candidate for era ##dication of sar ##s - co ##v in animal reservoirs , thereby reducing the risk of transmitting the infection to humans .  
development of vaccines is essential for the prevention of future rec ##ur ##rence ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the spike ( s ) protein , especially receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v , plays important roles in the prevention of sar ##s infection , and is thus an important component in sar ##s vaccine development . in this study , we expressed a 219 - mer ( residues 318 – 53 ##6 ) rb ##d protein in chinese ham ##ster o ##vary ( cho ) - k ##1 cells ( rb ##d ##21 ##9 - cho ) , and tested its immune responses and protective immunity in a mouse model . the results showed that this rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein was correctly folded , being able to maintain intact conform ##ation and authentic antigen ##ici ##ty . it could induce strong humor ##al and cellular immune responses and high ti ##ters of neutral ##izing antibodies in the va ##cci ##nated mice . rb ##d ##21 ##9 - cho protein eli ##cite ##d potent protective immunity that protected all va ##cci ##nated mice from sar ##s - co ##v challenge . these results suggest that the rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d ##21 ##9 - cho protein has great potential for the development of an effective and safe sar ##s subunit vaccine .  
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) at the cellular level is unclear . no human cell line was previously known to be susceptible to both sar ##s - co ##v and other human corona ##virus ##es . huh ##7 cells were found to be susceptible to both sar ##s - co ##v , associated with sar ##s , and human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) , usually associated with the common cold . highly l ##ytic and productive rates of infections within 48 h of in ##oc ##ulation were rep ##rod ##ucible with both viruses . the early transcription ##al profiles of host cell response to both types of infection at 2 and 4 h post ##ino ##cula ##tion were determined by using the af ##fy ##met ##rix h ##g - u ##13 ##3 ##a micro ##ar ##ray ( about 22 , 000 genes ) . much more per ##tur ##bation of cellular gene transcription was observed after infection by sar ##s - co ##v than after infection by hc ##ov - 229 ##e . besides the up ##re ##gul ##ation of genes associated with ap ##op ##tosis , which was exactly opposite to the previously reported effect of sar ##s - co ##v in a colon ##ic car ##cino ##ma cell line , genes related to inflammation , stress response , and pro ##co ##ag ##ulation were also up ##re ##gul ##ated . these findings were confirmed by semi ##qua ##nti ##tative reverse transcription - pc ##r , reverse transcription - quantitative pc ##r for mrna of genes , and im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys for some encoded proteins . these transcript ##oma ##l changes are compatible with the his ##to ##logical changes of pulmonary va ##scu ##lit ##is and micro ##vas ##cular th ##rom ##bos ##is in addition to the diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage involving the p ##ne ##um ##ocytes .  
the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of h ##la - a2 - restricted t - cell ep ##ito ##pes in the s protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and of human corona ##virus strain 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) was analyzed for the eli ##cit ##ation of a t - cell immune response in donors who had fully recovered from sar ##s - co ##v infection . we employed online database analysis to compare the differences in the amino acid sequences of the homo ##log ##ous t ep ##ito ##pes of hc ##ov - 229 ##e and sar ##s - co ##v . the identified t - cell ep ##ito ##pe peptide ##s were synthesized , and their binding af ##fin ##ities for h ##la - a2 were valid ##ated and compared in the t ##2 cell system . the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of all these peptide ##s was assessed by using t cells obtained from donors who had fully recovered from sar ##s - co ##v infection and from healthy donors with no history of sar ##s - co ##v infection . h ##la - a2 typing by indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent antibody stain ##ing showed that 51 . 6 % of sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients were h ##la - a2 positive . online database analysis and the t ##2 cell binding test disclosed that the number of h ##la - a2 - restricted im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes of the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v was decreased or even lost in comparison with the homo ##log ##ous sequences of the s protein of hc ##ov - 229 ##e . among the peptide ##s used in the study , the affinity of peptide ##s from hc ##ov - 229 ##e ( h ##7 ##7 and h ##8 ##8 ##1 ) and peptide ##s from sar ##s - co ##v ( s ##9 ##7 ##8 and s ##12 ##0 ##3 ) for binding to h ##la - a2 was higher than that of other sequences . the gamma inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - γ ) release eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ay revealed that only sar ##s - co ##v - specific peptide ##s s ##12 ##0 ##3 and s ##9 ##7 ##8 induced a high frequency of if ##n - γ - secret ##ing t - cell response in h ##la - a2 ( + ) donors who had fully recovered from sar ##s - co ##v infection ; such a t - cell ep ##ito ##pe - specific response was not observed in h ##la - a2 ( + ) healthy donors or in h ##la - a2 ( − ) donors who had been infected with sar ##s - co ##v after full recovery . thus , t - cell ep ##ito ##pes s ##12 ##0 ##3 and s ##9 ##7 ##8 are im ##mun ##ogenic and eli ##cit an over ##t
the clinical picture of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is characterized by pulmonary inflammation and respiratory failure , resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome . however , the events that lead to the recruitment of le ##uk ##ocytes are poorly understood . to study the cellular response in the acute phase of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) - host cell interaction , we investigated the induction of che ##mo ##kin ##es , ad ##hesion molecules , and dc - sign ( den ##dr ##itic cell - specific ic ##am - 3 - grabbing non ##int ##eg ##rin ) by sar ##s - co ##v . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry revealed ne ##ut ##rop ##hil , macro ##pha ##ge , and cd ##8 t - cell in ##filtration in the lung autopsy of a sar ##s patient who died during the acute phase of illness . additionally , p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and macro ##pha ##ges in the patient ' s lung expressed p - select ##in and dc - sign . in in vitro study , we showed that the a ##54 ##9 and th ##p - 1 cell lines were susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v . a ##54 ##9 cells produced cc ##l ##2 / mono ##cy ##te che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t protein 1 ( mc ##p - 1 ) and c ##x ##cl ##8 / inter ##le ##uki ##n - 8 ( il - 8 ) after interaction with sar ##s - co ##v and expressed p - select ##in and vc ##am - 1 . moreover , sar ##s - co ##v induced th ##p - 1 cells to express cc ##l ##2 / mc ##p - 1 , c ##x ##cl ##8 / il - 8 , cc ##l ##3 / mi ##p - 1 ##α , c ##x ##cl ##10 / ip - 10 , cc ##l ##4 / mi ##p - 1 ##β , and cc ##l ##5 / ran ##tes , which attracted ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s , mono ##cytes , and activated t cells in a che ##mot ##ax ##is ass ##ay . we also demonstrated that dc - sign was ind ##ucible in th ##p - 1 as well as a ##54 ##9 cells after sar ##s - co ##v infection . our in vitro experiments modeling infection in humans together with the study of a lung bio ##psy of a patient who died during the early phase of infection demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v , through a dynamic interaction with lung ep ##ith ##elial cells and mono ##cy ##tic cells , creates an environment con ##du ##ci ##ve for immune cell migration and accumulation that eventually leads to lung injury .  
here we report the development of a more - sensitive im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) based on an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay using che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence ( cl ##eia ) to detect the viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) antigen in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate ( np ##a ) from patients infected with sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the cl ##eia was established with an optical combination of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against sar ##s co ##v n protein prepared from mice im ##mun ##ized with rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein without cult ##ivating the virus . the capture and detecting mab ##s of the cl ##eia reacted to the car ##box ##yl - terminal and amino - terminal peptide ##s of the n protein , respectively . the cl ##eia was capable of detecting rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein at 1 . 56 pg / ml and viral n protein in sar ##s co ##v cell culture l ##ys ##ates at 0 . 08 ##7 of 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive doses / ml . the cl ##eia showed no cross - react ##iv ##ities to rec ##om ##bina ##nt n proteins of common human co ##v ( 229 ##e , o ##c ##43 , and nl ##6 ##3 ) or l ##ys ##ates of cells infected with 229 ##e and o ##c ##43 . in addition , an evaluation with 18 sar ##s - positive np ##a samples , all confirmed sar ##s positive by quantitative pc ##r and antibodies to sar ##s co ##v , revealed that all ( 18 / 18 ) were found positive by the cl ##eia ; thus , the sensitivity of detection was 100 % . when we tested 20 sar ##s - negative np ##a samples , the cl ##eia was shown to have high specific ##ity ( 100 % ) . the sensitivity of our novel sar ##s cl ##eia was significantly higher than the previous e ##ia and comparable to the other methods using reverse transcription - pc ##r .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) synth ##es ##izes several put ##ative viral envelope proteins , including the spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) , and small envelope ( e ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s . although these proteins likely are essential for viral replication , their specific roles in sar ##s - co ##v entry have not been defined . in this report , we show that the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein media ##tes viral entry through ph - dependent end ##oc ##yt ##osis . further , we define its cellular tr ##op ##ism and demonstrate that virus transmission occurs through cell - mediated transfer by den ##dr ##itic cells . the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was used successfully to pseudo ##type replication - defective retro ##vira ##l and lent ##iv ##ira ##l vectors that readily infected ve ##ro cells as well as primary pulmonary and renal ep ##ith ##elial cells from human , non ##hum ##an primate , and , to a lesser extent , fe ##line species . the tr ##op ##ism of this reporter virus was similar to that of wild - type , replication - competent sar ##s - co ##v , and binding of pu ##rified s to susceptible target cells was demonstrated by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry . although my ##elo ##id den ##dr ##itic cells were able to interact with s and to bind virus , these cells could not be infected by sar ##s - co ##v . however , these cells were able to transfer the virus to susceptible target cells through a syn ##ap ##se - like structure . both cell - mediated infection and direct infection were inhibit ##ed by anti - s anti ##ser ##a , indicating that strategies directed toward this gene product are likely to con ##fer a therapeutic benefit for anti ##vira ##l drugs or the development of a sar ##s vaccine .  
the international outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 – 2003 highlighted the need to develop pre ##test ##ed human vaccine vectors that can be used in a rapid response against newly emerging pathogen ##s . we evaluated newcastle disease virus ( n ##d ##v ) , an av ##ian para ##my ##x ##ov ##irus that is highly at ##ten ##uated in primate ##s , as a topical respiratory vaccine vector with sar ##s - co ##v as a test pathogen . complete rec ##om ##bina ##nt n ##d ##v was engineered to express the sar ##s - co ##v spike s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , the viral neutral ##ization and major protective antigen , from an added transcription ##al unit . african green monkeys im ##mun ##ized through the respiratory tract with two doses of the vaccine developed a ti ##ter of sar ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing antibodies comparable with the robust secondary response observed in animals that have been im ##mun ##ized with a different experimental sar ##s - co ##v vaccine and challenged with sar ##s - co ##v . when animals im ##mun ##ized with n ##d ##v expressing s were challenged with a high dose of sar ##s - co ##v , direct viral ass ##ay of lung tissues taken by nec ##rop ##sy at the peak of viral replication demonstrated a 236 - or 1 , 102 - fold ( depending on the n ##d ##v vector construct ) mean reduction in pulmonary sar ##s - co ##v ti ##ter compared with control animals . n ##d ##v has the potential for further development as a pre ##test ##ed , highly at ##ten ##uated , intra ##nas ##al vector to be available for ex ##ped ##ited vaccine development for humans , who generally lack pre ##ex ##ist ##ing immunity against n ##d ##v .  
the human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v and nl ##6 ##3 employ ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) for cell entry . it was shown that rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v spike protein ( sar ##s - s ) down ##re ##gul ##ates ace ##2 expression and thereby promotes lung injury . whether nl ##6 ##3 - s ex ##ert ##s a similar activity is yet unknown . we found that rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - s bound to ace ##2 and induced ace ##2 shed ##ding with higher efficiency than nl ##6 ##3 - s . shed ##ding most likely accounted for the previously observed ace ##2 down ##re ##gul ##ation but was di ##sp ##ens ##able for viral replication . finally , sar ##s - co ##v but not nl ##6 ##3 replicate ##d efficiently in ace ##2 - positive ve ##ro cells and reduced ace ##2 expression , indicating robust receptor interference in the context of sar ##s - co ##v but not nl ##6 ##3 infection .  
the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protective efficacy of a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine consisting of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus lacking the e gene ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e ) were studied using ham ##sters . ham ##sters im ##mun ##ized with rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e developed high serum - neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters and were protected from replication of homo ##log ##ous ( sar ##s - co ##v urban ##i ) and het ##ero ##log ##ous ( g ##d ##0 ##3 ) sar ##s - co ##v in the upper and lower respiratory tract . rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e - im ##mun ##ized ham ##sters remained active following wild - type virus challenge , while mock - im ##mun ##ized ham ##sters displayed decreased activity . despite being at ##ten ##uated in replication in the respiratory tract , rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e is an im ##mun ##ogenic and e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine in ham ##sters .  
a rapid antigen test for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is essential for control of this disease at the point of management . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is abundant ##ly expressed in infected - cell culture fi ##lt ##rate as demons ##tra ##ble by western b ##lot ##ting using con ##vale ##scent - phase sera from patients with sar ##s . we used mono ##cl ##onal antibodies specifically directed against n protein to establish a sensitive antigen capture sandwich enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v . the ass ##ay employed a mixture of three mono ##cl ##onal antibodies for capture and rabbit poly ##cl ##onal antibodies for detection of serum antigen in 32 cases of clinical ##ly probable sar ##s as defined by the world health organization during the epidemic in guangzhou , china . rec ##om ##bina ##nt n protein was used as a standard to establish a detection sensitivity of approximate ##d 50 pg / ml . the linear range of detection in clinical specimens was from 100 pg / ml to 3 . 2 ng / ml . using a panel of sera collected at different points in time , the amount of circulating n antigen was found to peak 6 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms . the sensitivity of the ass ##ay was 84 . 6 % in 13 ser ##ological ##ly confirmed sar ##s patients with blood taken during the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms ( 11 of 13 ) . the specific ##ity of the ass ##ay was 98 . 5 % in 1 , 272 healthy individuals ( 1 , 253 of 1 , 272 ) . there was no cross - reaction with other human and animal corona ##virus ##es in this ass ##ay . in conclusion , a sensitive and quantitative antigen capture elisa was established for the early diagnosis and disease monitoring of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe respiratory disease in humans . we tested a rec ##om ##bina ##nt modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) vaccine expressing full - length mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein by im ##mun ##izing bal ##b / c mice with either intra ##mus ##cular or sub ##cut ##aneous regime ##ns . in all cases , mv ##a - mer ##s - s induced mer ##s - co ##v - specific cd ##8 ( + ) t cells and virus - neutral ##izing antibodies . va ##cci ##nated mice were protected against mer ##s - co ##v challenge infection after trans ##duction with the human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 receptor . this mer ##s - co ##v infection model demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine .  
with more than 1 , 700 laboratory - confirmed infections , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) remains a significant threat for public health . however , the lack of detailed data on modes of transmission from the animal reservoir and between humans means that the drivers of mer ##s - co ##v epidemic ##s remain poorly characterized . here , we develop a statistical framework to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transmission patterns underlying the 68 ##1 mer ##s - co ##v cases detected in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) between january 2013 and july 2014 . we assess how infections from the animal reservoir , the different levels of mixing , and het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##ies in transmission have contributed to the build ##up of mer ##s - co ##v epidemic ##s in ks ##a . we estimate that 12 % [ 95 % credible interval ( ci ) : 9 % , 15 % ] of cases were infected from the reservoir , the rest via human - to - human transmission in clusters ( 60 % ; ci : 57 % , 63 % ) , within ( 23 % ; ci : 20 % , 27 % ) , or between ( 5 % ; ci : 2 % , 8 % ) regions . the reproduction number at the start of a cluster was 0 . 45 ( ci : 0 . 33 , 0 . 58 ) on average , but with large sd ( 0 . 53 ; ci : 0 . 35 , 0 . 78 ) . it was > 1 in 12 % ( ci : 6 % , 18 % ) of clusters but fell by approximately one - half ( 47 % ci : 34 % , 63 % ) its original value after 10 cases on average . the ongoing exposure of humans to mer ##s - co ##v from the reservoir is of major concern , given the continued risk of substantial outbreak ##s in health care systems . the approach we present allows the study of infectious disease transmission when data linking cases to each other remain limited and uncertain .  
fourteen or ##fs have been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome . or ##f 3a of sar ##s - co ##v codes for a recently identified trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein , but its function remains unknown . in this study we confirmed the 3a protein expression and investigated its local ##ization at the surface of sar ##s - co ##v - infected or 3a - cd ##na - trans ##fect ##ed cells . our experiments showed that rec ##om ##bina ##nt 3a protein can form a homo ##tet ##ram ##er complex through inter ##pro ##tein di ##sul ##fide bridges in 3a - cd ##na - trans ##fect ##ed cells , providing a clue to ion channel function . the put ##ative ion channel activity of this protein was assessed in 3a - complement rna - injected x ##eno ##pus o ##ocytes by two - electrode voltage cl ##amp . the results suggest that 3a protein forms a potassium sensitive channel , which can be efficiently inhibit ##ed by bari ##um . after fr ##h ##k - 4 cells were trans ##fect ##ed with an sir ##na , which is known to suppress 3a expression , followed by infection with sar ##s - co ##v , the released virus was significantly decreased , whereas the replication of the virus in the infected cells was not changed . our observation suggests that sar ##s - co ##v or ##f 3a functions as an ion channel that may promote virus release . this finding will help to explain the highly pathogen ##ic nature of sar ##s - co ##v and to develop new strategies for treatment of sar ##s infection .  
mutations in the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) can alter its clinical presentation , and the study of its mutation patterns in human populations can facilitate contact tracing . here , we describe the development and validation of an ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing array for inter ##ro ##gating the entire 30 - kb sar ##s - co ##v genome in a rapid , cost - effective fashion . using this platform , we sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s from ve ##ro cell culture isolate ##s of 12 patients and directly from four patient tissues . the sequence obtained from the array is highly rep ##rod ##ucible , accurate ( > 99 . 99 % accuracy ) and capable of identifying known and novel variants of sar ##s - co ##v . notably , we applied this technology to a field specimen of probable sar ##s and rapidly de ##duced its infectious source . we demonstrate that array - based res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing - by - hybrid ##ization is a fast , reliable , and economical alternative to cap ##illa ##ry sequencing for obtaining sar ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequence on a population scale , making this an ideal platform for the global monitoring of sar ##s - co ##v and other small - genome pathogen ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a rapidly emerging pathogen with potentially serious consequences for public health . here we describe conditions that result not only in the efficient expression of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein on the surface of cells , but in its incorporation into lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles that can be used to trans ##du ##ce cells in an s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein - dependent manner . we found that although some primate cell lines , including ve ##ro e ##6 , 293 ##t and huh - 7 cells , could be efficiently trans ##duced by sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein pseudo ##virus ##es , other cells lines were either resistant or very poorly per ##missive to virus entry . infection by pseudo ##vir ##ions could be inhibit ##ed by several l ##ys ##oso ##mot ##rop ##ic agents , suggesting a requirement for acid ##ification of end ##oso ##mes for efficient s - mediated viral entry . in addition , we were able to develop a cell – cell fusion ass ##ay that could be used to monitor s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein - dependent membrane fusion . although pro ##te ##ol ##ysis did not enhance the in ##fect ##ivity of cell - free pseudo ##vir ##ions , try ##ps ##in activation is required for cell – cell fusion . additionally , there was no apparent ph requirement for s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein - mediated cell – cell fusion . together , these studies describe important tools that can be used to study sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein structure and function , including approaches that can be used to identify inhibitors of the entry of sar ##s - co ##v into target cells .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans , and in vitro models of the lung are needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te cellular targets and the consequences of viral infection . the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , human ang ##iot ##ens ##in 1 - converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) , was detected in ci ##lia ##ted air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells of human air ##way tissues derived from nasal or tr ##ache ##ob ##ron ##chia ##l regions , suggesting that sar ##s - co ##v may in ##fect the pro ##xi ##mal airways . to assess in ##fect ##ivity in an in vitro model of human ci ##lia ##ted air ##way ep ##ith ##elia ( ha ##e ) derived from nasal and tr ##ache ##ob ##ron ##chia ##l air ##way regions , we generated rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v by del ##eti ##on of open reading frame 7 ##a / 7 ##b ( or ##f ##7 ##a / 7 ##b ) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein ( g ##fp ) , resulting in sar ##s - co ##v g ##fp . sar ##s - co ##v g ##fp replicate ##d to ti ##ters similar to those of wild - type viruses in cell lines . sar ##s - co ##v specifically infected ha ##e via the apical surface and replicate ##d to ti ##ters of 10 ( 7 ) p ##fu / ml by 48 h post ##in ##fect ##ion . poly ##cl ##onal anti ##ser ##a directed against ha ##ce ##2 blocked virus infection and replication , suggesting that ha ##ce ##2 is the primary receptor for sar ##s - co ##v infection of ha ##e . sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins and vi ##rion ##s localized to ci ##lia ##ted ep ##ith ##elial cells . infection was highly cy ##to ##ly ##tic , as infected ci ##lia ##ted cells were nec ##rot ##ic and shed over time onto the lu ##mina ##l surface of the ep ##ith ##eli ##um . sar ##s - co ##v g ##fp also replicate ##d to a lesser extent in ci ##lia ##ted cell cultures derived from ham ##ster or r ##hes ##us monkey airways . efficient sar ##s - co ##v infection of ci ##lia ##ted cells in ha ##e provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v replication and pathogen ##esis .  
human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) was recently identified as the receptor for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , suggesting that other mammalian d ##pp ##4 or ##th ##olo ##gs may also support infection . we demonstrate that mouse d ##pp ##4 cannot support mer ##s - co ##v infection . however , employing mouse d ##pp ##4 as a sc ##af ##fold , we identified two critical amino acids ( a2 ##8 ##8 ##l and t ##33 ##0 ##r ) that regulate species specific ##ity in the mouse . this knowledge can support the rational design of a mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v for rapid assessment of therapeutic ##s .  
the production of virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) constitutes a relevant and safe model to study molecular deter ##mina ##nts of vi ##rion e ##gre ##ss . the minimal requirement for the assembly of v ##lp ##s for the corona ##virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is still controversial . recent studies have shown that sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp formation depends on either m and e proteins or m and n proteins . here we show that both e and n proteins must be coe ##x ##pressed with m protein for the efficient production and release of v ##lp ##s by trans ##fect ##ed ve ##ro e ##6 cells . this suggests that the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v assembly differs from that of other studied corona ##virus ##es , which only require m and e proteins for v ##lp formation . when coe ##x ##pressed , the native envelope trim ##eric s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is incorporated onto v ##lp ##s . interesting ##ly , when a fluorescent protein tag is added to the c - terminal end of n or s protein , but not m protein , the chi ##meric viral proteins can be assembled within v ##lp ##s and allow visual ##ization of v ##lp production and trafficking in living cells by state - of - the - art imaging technologies . fluorescent v ##lp ##s will be used further to investigate the role of cellular machine ##ries during sar ##s - co ##v e ##gre ##ss .  
the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was shown to be associated with a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) now called sar ##s co ##v . we report here the generation of sar ##s co ##v s protein - pseudo ##type ##d mu ##rine leukemia virus ( ml ##v ) vector particles . the wild - type s protein pseudo ##type ##d ml ##v vectors , although at a low efficiency . partial del ##eti ##on of the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of s dramatically increased in ##fect ##ivity of pseudo ##type ##s , with ti ##ters only two - to three ##fold lower than those of pseudo ##type ##s generated in parallel with the ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus g protein . s - pseudo ##type ##d ml ##v particles were used to analyze viral tr ##op ##ism . ml ##v ( sar ##s ) pseudo ##type ##s and wild - type sar ##s co ##v displayed similar cell types and tissue and host restrictions , indicating that the expression of a functional receptor is the major restraint in per ##missive ##ness to sar ##s co ##v infection . efficient gene transfer could be detected in ve ##ro and ca ##co ##2 cells , whereas the level of gene marking of 293 ##t , he ##la , and he ##pg ##2 cells was only slightly above background levels . a cat cell line and a dog cell line were not susceptible . interesting ##ly , p ##k - 15 , a por ##cine kidney cell line , and primary por ##cine kidney cells were also highly per ##missive for sar ##s s pseudo ##type ##s and wild - type sar ##s co ##v . this finding suggests that sw ##ine may be susceptible to sar ##s infection and may be a source for infection of humans . taken together , these results indicate that ml ##v ( sar ##s ) pseudo ##type ##s are highly valuable for functional studies of viral tr ##op ##ism and entry and , in addition , can be a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic entry inhibitors without posing a bio ##ha ##zard to human beings .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro ) is involved in the processing of the viral poly ##pro ##tein and , thereby , contributes to the bio ##genesis of the virus replication complex . structural bio ##in ##form ##atics has revealed a relationship for the sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro to her ##pes ##virus - associated u ##bi ##qui ##tin - specific pro ##tea ##se ( ha ##us ##p ) , a u ##bi ##qui ##tin - specific pro ##tea ##se , indicating potential de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activity in addition to its function in poly ##pro ##tein processing ( t . sul ##ea , h . a . lin ##dner , e . o . pu ##ris ##ima , and r . men ##ard , j . vi ##rol . 79 : 45 ##50 - 45 ##51 , 2005 ) . in order to confirm this prediction , we over ##ex ##pressed and pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro ( amino acids [ aa ] 150 ##7 to 1858 ) from es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . the pu ##rified enzyme hydro ##ly ##zed u ##bi ##qui ##tin - 7 - amino - 4 - methyl ##co ##uma ##rin ( u ##b - amc ) , a general de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzyme substrate , with a catalytic efficiency of 13 , 100 m ( − ##1 ) s ( − ##1 ) , 220 - fold more efficiently than the small synthetic peptide substrate z - l ##rg ##g - amc , which incorporates the c - terminal four residues of u ##bi ##qui ##tin . in addition , sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro was inhibit ##ed by the specific de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzyme inhibitor u ##bi ##qui ##tin al ##deh ##yde , with an inhibition constant of 210 nm . the pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro di ##sas ##se ##mble ##s branched poly ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in chains with lengths of two to seven ( u ##b ##2 - 7 ) or four ( u ##b ##4 ) units , which involves iso ##pe ##pt ##ide bond cleavage . sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro processing activity was also detected against a protein fused to the c terminus of the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like mod ##ifier is ##g ##15 , both in vitro using the pu ##rified enzyme and in he ##la cells by coe ##x ##press ##ion with sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro ( aa 119 ##8 to 2009 ) . these results clearly establish that sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro is a de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzyme , thereby confirming our earlier prediction . this unexpected activity for a corona ##virus papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se suggests a novel viral strategy to mod ##ulate the host cell u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion machinery to its advantage
the highly pathogen ##ic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cause significant mor ##bid ##ity and morality . there is currently no approved therapeutic for highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es , even as mer ##s - co ##v is spreading throughout the middle east . we previously screened a library of fda - approved drugs for inhibitors of corona ##virus replication in which we identified abel ##son ( ab ##l ) kinase inhibitors , including the anti ##can ##cer drug im ##atin ##ib , as inhibitors of both sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in vitro . here we show that the anti - co ##v activity of im ##atin ##ib occurs at the early stages of infection , after internal ##ization and end ##osomal trafficking , by inhibit ##ing fusion of the vi ##rion ##s at the end ##osomal membrane . we specifically identified the im ##atin ##ib target , abel ##son ty ##ros ##ine - protein kinase 2 ( ab ##l ##2 ) , as required for efficient sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v replication in vitro . these data demonstrate that specific approved drugs can be characterized in vitro for their anti ##cor ##ona ##virus activity and used to identify host proteins required for corona ##virus replication . this type of study is an important step in the rep ##ur ##po ##sing of approved drugs for treatment of emerging corona ##virus ##es . importance both sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v are zoo ##not ##ic infections , with bats as the primary source . the 2003 sar ##s - co ##v outbreak began in guangdong province in china and spread to humans via ci ##vet cats and ra ##cco ##on dogs in the wet markets before spreading to 37 countries . the virus caused 8 , 09 ##6 confirmed cases of sar ##s and 77 ##4 deaths ( a case fatal ##ity rate of [UNK] % ) . the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak began in saudi arabia and has spread to 27 countries . mer ##s - co ##v is believed to have emerged from bats and passed into humans via camel ##s . the ongoing outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v has resulted in 1 , 79 ##1 cases of mer ##s and 640 deaths ( a case fatal ##ity rate of 36 % ) . the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v provides evidence that corona ##virus ##es are currently spreading from zoo ##not ##ic sources and can be highly pathogen ##ic , causing serious mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in humans . treatment of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v infection is limited to providing supportive therapy consistent with any serious lung disease , as no specific drugs have been approved as therapeutic
zoo ##not ##ic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) likely evolved to in ##fect humans by a series of transmission events between humans and animals in markets in china . virus sequence data suggest that the palm ci ##vet served as an amp ##li ##fication host in which ci ##vet and human interaction foster ##ed the evolution of the epidemic sar ##s urban ##i strain . the proto ##typic ci ##vet strain of sar ##s - co ##v , s ##z ##16 , was isolated from a palm ci ##vet but has not been successfully culture ##d in vitro . to prop ##aga ##te a chi ##meric rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v bearing an s ##z ##16 spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( ic ##sz ##16 - s ) , we constructed cell lines expressing the ci ##vet or ##th ##olo ##g ( db ##t - ca ##ce ##2 ) of the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( ha ##ce ##2 ) . zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v was completely dependent on ace ##2 for entry . urban ##i grew with similar kinetic ##s in both the db ##t - ca ##ce ##2 and the db ##t - ha ##ce ##2 cells , while ic ##sz ##16 - s only grew in db ##t - ca ##ce ##2 cells . the s ##z ##16 - s mutant viruses adapted to human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells and displayed enhanced affinity for ha ##ce ##2 but exhibited severe growth defects in the db ##t - ca ##ce ##2 cells , suggesting that the evolutionary pathway that promoted efficient ha ##ce ##2 interactions simultaneously abolished efficient ca ##ce ##2 interactions . structural modeling predicted two distinct bio ##chemical interaction networks by which zoo ##not ##ic receptor binding domain architecture can productive ##ly engage ha ##ce ##2 , but only the urban ##i mutation ##al repertoire promoted efficient usage of both ha ##ce ##2 and ca ##ce ##2 binding interfaces . since dual species tr ##op ##ism was preserved in urban ##i , it is likely that the virus evolved a high affinity for ca ##ce ##2 / ha ##ce ##2 receptors through adaptation via repeated passages between human and ci ##vet hosts . furthermore , zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v was var ##ia ##bly neutral ##ized by antibodies that were effective against the epidemic strain , highlighting their utility for evaluating passive im ##mun ##ization efficacy .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have been studied for over 60 years , but have only recently gained notoriety as deadly human pathogen ##s with the emergence of severe respiratory syndrome co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome virus . the rapid emergence of these viruses has demonstrated the need for good models to study severe co ##v respiratory infection and pathogen ##esis . there are , currently , different methods and models for the study of co ##v disease . the available genetic methods for the study and evaluation of co ##v genetics are reviewed here . there are several animal models , both mouse and alternative animals , for the study of severe co ##v respiratory disease that have been examined , each with different pro ##s and con ##s relative to the actual pathogen ##esis of the disease in humans . a current limitation of these models is that no animal model perfectly rec ##ap ##it ##ulates the disease seen in humans . through the review and analysis of the available disease models , investigators can employ the most appropriate available model to study various aspects of co ##v pathogen ##esis and evaluate possible anti ##vira ##l treatments that may potentially be successful in future treatment and prevention of severe co ##v respiratory infections .  
since the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in mid - 2012 , there has been controversy over the respiratory pre ##ca ##ution recommendations in different guidelines from various international bodies . our understanding of mer ##s - co ##v is still evolving . current recommendations on infection control practices are heavily influenced by the lessons learnt from severe acute respiratory syndrome . a debate on respiratory precautions for mer ##s - co ##v was organised by infection control association ( singapore ) and the society of infectious disease ( singapore ) . we here ##in discuss and present the evidence for surgical masks for the protection of healthcare workers from mer ##s - co ##v .  
small animal models are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of candidate vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls directed against the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) . we investigated the ability of sar ##s co ##v to in ##fect 5 - week - old golden syrian ham ##sters . when administered intra ##nas ##ally , sar ##s co ##v replicate ##s to high ti ##ters in the lungs and nasal tu ##rbin ##ates . peak replication in the lower respiratory tract was noted on day 2 post ##in ##fect ##ion ( p . i . ) and was cleared by day 7 p . i . low levels of virus were present in the nasal tu ##rbin ##ates of a few ham ##sters at 14 days p . i . viral replication in ep ##ith ##elial cells of the respiratory tract was accompanied by cellular nec ##rosis early in infection , followed by an inflammatory response coincide ##nt with viral clearance , focal consolidation in pulmonary tissue , and eventual pulmonary tissue repair . despite high levels of virus replication and associated pathology in the respiratory tract , the ham ##sters showed no evidence of disease . neutral ##izing antibodies were detected in sera at day 7 p . i . , and mean ti ##ters at day 28 p . i . exceeded 1 : 400 . ham ##sters challenged with sar ##s co ##v at day 28 p . i . were completely protected from virus replication and accompanying pathology in the respiratory tract . comparing these data to the mouse model , sar ##s co ##v replicate ##s to a higher ti ##ter and for a longer duration in the respiratory tract of ham ##sters and is accompanied by significant pathology that is absent in mice . vi ##rem ##ia and extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry spread of sar ##s co ##v to liver and sp ##leen , which are seen in ham ##sters , were not detected in mice . the ham ##ster , therefore , is superior to the mouse as a model for the evaluation of anti ##vira ##l agents and candidate vaccines against sar ##s co ##v replication .  
a ta ##q ##man amp ##lic ##on targeting the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is 5 log ( 10 ) times more sensitive for sar ##s - co ##v target rna extracted from infected cells and 2 . 79 log ( 10 ) times more sensitive for rna extracted from patient material of the index case in frankfurt than an amp ##lic ##on targeting the polymer ##ase gene .  
estimates of ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity to a new infectious agent in a community are useful to public health . for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the figures are conflicting . here ##in , we screened 12 , 000 people in a community stricken by sar ##s 10 months previously and found 53 individuals ( 0 . 44 % ) who had im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g antibodies to the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) produced in bacteria . however , only seven of these ( group 1 ) had sera which also reacted with the native n antigen expressed in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells , n - trans ##fect ##ed 293 ##t cells , and tissues of infected sar ##s patients . of these , six individuals had had sar ##s previously . the remaining person , as well as the 46 other individuals ( group 2 ) , were healthy and had no history of sar ##s . group 1 antibodies recognized ep ##ito ##pes located slightly differently in n from those of group 2 antibodies , and a mouse hybrid ##oma antibody resembling the former type was generated . unusually , group 2 antibodies appeared to recognize cross - reactive bacterial ep ##ito ##pes that presumably were post ##tra ##ns ##lation ##ally modified in eu ##kar ##yo ##tes and hence were probably not induced by sar ##s - co ##v or related corona ##virus ##es but rather by bacteria . the n antigen is thus highly unique . the extremely low rate ( 0 . 00 ##8 % ) of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s infection found at ##test ##s to the high vi ##ru ##lence of the sar ##s - co ##v virus .  
in this territory - wide molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology study of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) in hong kong involving 1 , 54 ##1 dead wild birds , three novel co ##vs were identified in three different bird families ( bulb ##ul co ##v hk ##u ##11 [ bu ##co ##v hk ##u ##11 ] , thru ##sh co ##v hk ##u ##12 [ th ##co ##v hk ##u ##12 ] , and mu ##nia co ##v hk ##u ##13 [ mu ##co ##v hk ##u ##13 ] ) . four complete genome ##s of the three novel co ##vs were sequence ##d . their genome ##s ( 26 , 39 ##6 to 26 , 55 ##2 bases ) represent the smallest known co ##v genome ##s . in phylogenetic trees constructed using ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) , rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( pol ) , he ##lica ##se , spike , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins , bu ##co ##v hk ##u ##11 , th ##co ##v hk ##u ##12 , and mu ##co ##v hk ##u ##13 formed a cluster distant ##ly related to infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus and turkey co ##v ( group 3a co ##vs ) . for he ##lica ##se , spike , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , they were also clustered with a co ##v recently discovered in asian leopard cats , for which the complete genome sequence was not available . the 3 ##cl ( pro ) , pol , he ##lica ##se , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id of the three co ##vs possessed higher amino acid identities to those of group 3a co ##vs than to those of group 1 and group 2 co ##vs . unique gen ##omic features distinguishing them from other group 3 co ##vs include a distinct transcription regulatory sequence and coding potential for small open reading frames . based on these results , we propose a novel co ##v subgroup , group 3 ##c , to describe this distinct subgroup of co ##vs under the group 3 co ##vs . av ##ian co ##vs are genetically more diverse than previously thought and may be closely related to some newly identified mammalian co ##vs . further studies would be important to del ##ine ##ate whether the asian leopard cat co ##v was a result of inter ##sp ##ec ##ies jumping from birds , a situation analogous to that of bat and ci ##vet severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##vs .  
in this study , infection of 293 / ace ##2 cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) activated several ap ##op ##tosis - associated events , namely , cleavage of cas ##pas ##e - 3 , cas ##pas ##e - 8 , and poly ( ad ##p - rib ##ose ) polymer ##ase 1 ( par ##p ) , and ch ##rom ##atin conde ##ns ##ation and the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and hence ina ##ct ##ivation of the eu ##kar ##yo ##tic translation initiation factor 2 ##α ( e ##if ##2 ##α ) . in addition , two of the three cellular e ##if ##2 ##α kinase ##s known to be virus induced , protein kinase r ( p ##kr ) and p ##kr - like end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum kinase ( per ##k ) , were activated by sar ##s - co ##v . the third kinase , general control non ##der ##ep ##ress ##ible - 2 kinase ( g ##c ##n ##2 ) , was not activated , but late in infection the level of g ##c ##n ##2 protein was significantly reduced . reverse transcription - pc ##r analyses revealed that the reduction of g ##c ##n ##2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of g ##c ##n ##2 mrna . the specific reduction of p ##kr protein expression by anti ##sen ##se peptide - con ##ju ##gated ph ##os ##ph ##oro ##dia ##mi ##date mor ##ph ##olin ##o ol ##igo ##mers strongly reduced cleavage of par ##p in infected cells . surprisingly , the knock ##down of p ##kr neither enhanced sar ##s - co ##v replication nor ab ##rogated sar ##s - co ##v - induced e ##if ##2 ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation . pre ##tre ##at ##ment of cells with beta inter ##fer ##on prior to sar ##s - co ##v infection led to a significant decrease in per ##k activation , e ##if ##2 ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation , and sar ##s - co ##v replication . the various effects of beta inter ##fer ##on treatment were found to function independently on the expression of p ##kr . our results show that sar ##s - co ##v infection activate ##s p ##kr and per ##k , leading to sustained e ##if ##2 ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation . however , virus replication was not impaired by these events , suggesting that sar ##s - co ##v possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitor ##y effects of ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated e ##if ##2 ##α on viral mrna translation . furthermore , our data suggest that viral activation of p ##kr can lead to ap ##op ##tosis via a pathway that is independent of e ##if ##2 ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in ##fect ##s human bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cal ##u - 3 cells . unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v , which exclusively in ##fect ##s and releases through the apical route , this virus can do so through either side of polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 cells . infection results in profound ap ##op ##tosis within 24 h ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of its production of ti ##ters that are lower than those of sar ##s - co ##v . together , our results provide new insights into the dissemination and pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v and may indicate that the virus differs markedly from sar ##s - co ##v .  
anti ##vira ##l agents are urgently needed to fight severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . we showed that nic ##los ##ami ##de , an existing anti ##helm ##int ##hic drug , was able to inhibit replication of a newly discovered corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v ; viral antigen synthesis was totally abolished at a nic ##los ##ami ##de concentration of 1 . 56 μ ##m , as revealed by im ##mun ##ob ##lot analysis . thus , nic ##los ##ami ##de represents a promising drug candidate for the effective treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
a newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is the et ##iol ##ogical agent responsible for the outbreak of sar ##s . the sar ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se , which is a 33 . 8 - k ##da pro ##tea ##se ( also called the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ) , plays a pivotal role in media ##ting viral replication and transcription functions through extensive pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of two replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s , pp ##1 ##a ( 48 ##6 k ##da ) and pp ##1 ##ab ( 79 ##0 k ##da ) . here , we report the crystal structures of the sar ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se at different ph values and in complex with a specific inhibitor . the pro ##tea ##se structure has a fold that can be described as an augmented ser ##ine - pro ##tea ##se , but with a cy ##s - his at the active site . this series of crystal structures , which is the first , to our knowledge , of any protein from the sar ##s virus , reveal substantial ph - dependent conform ##ation ##al changes , and an unexpected mode of inhibitor binding , providing a structural basis for rational drug design .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a severe respiratory disease with a fatal ##ity rate of approximately 30 % . the high vi ##ru ##lence and mortality rate prompted us to analyze aspects of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , especially its interaction with innate immune cells such as antigen - presenting cells ( ap ##cs ) . particularly , we analyzed secret ##ion of type i and type iii inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) by ap ##cs , i . e . , b cells , macro ##pha ##ges , mono ##cy ##te - derived / my ##elo ##id den ##dr ##itic cells ( md ##dc ##s / md ##cs ) , and by plasma ##cy ##to ##id den ##dr ##itic cells ( pd ##cs ) of human and mu ##rine origin after in ##oc ##ulation with mer ##s - co ##v . production of large amounts of type i and iii if ##ns was induced exclusively in human pd ##cs , which were significantly higher than if ##n induction by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v . of note , if ##ns were secret ##ed in the absence of productive replication . however , receptor binding , end ##osomal up ##take , and probably signaling via toll - like receptor 7 ( t ##lr ##7 ) were critical for sensing of mer ##s - co ##v by pd ##cs . furthermore , active transcription of mer ##s - co ##v n rna and subsequent n protein expression were evident in infected pd ##cs , indicating ab ##ort ##ive infection . taken together , our results point toward dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) - dependent end ##osomal up ##take and subsequent infection of human pd ##cs by mer ##s - co ##v . however , the replication cycle is stopped after early gene expression . in parallel , human pd ##cs are potent if ##n - producing cells upon mer ##s - co ##v infection . knowledge of such if ##n responses supports our understanding of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and is critical for the choice of treatment options . importance mer ##s - co ##v causes a severe respiratory disease with high fatal ##ity rates in human patients . recently , confirmed human cases have increased dramatically in both number and geographic distribution . understanding the pathogen ##esis of this highly pathogen ##ic co ##v is crucial for developing successful treatment strategies . this study el ##uc ##ida ##tes the interaction of mer ##s - co ##v with ap ##cs and pd ##cs , particularly the induction of type i and iii if ##n secret ##ion . human pd ##cs are the immune cell population sensing mer ##s - co ##v but secret ##e significantly larger amounts of if ##ns , especially if ##n - α , than in response
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a viral respiratory illness first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 caused by the human corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , mer ##s - co ##v . using full - genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis , scientists have identified three clade ##s and multiple lineage ##s of mer ##s - co ##v in humans and the zoo ##not ##ic host , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . in this study , we have characterized eight mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s collected from patients in saudi arabia in 2015 . we have performed full - genome sequencing on the viral isolate ##s , and compared them to the corresponding clinical specimens . all isolate ##s were clade b , lineage ##s 4 and 5 . three of the isolate ##s carry del ##eti ##ons located on three independent regions of the genome in the 5 ′ ut ##r , or ##f ##1 ##a and or ##f ##3 . all novel mer ##s - co ##v strains replicate ##d efficiently in ve ##ro and huh ##7 cells . viruses with del ##eti ##ons in the 5 ′ ut ##r and or ##f ##1 ##a exhibited impaired viral release in ve ##ro cells . these data emphasize the plastic ##ity of the mer ##s - co ##v genome during human infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the pathogen of sar ##s , which caused a global panic in 2003 . we describe here the screening of chinese herbal medicine - based , novel small molecules that bind avid ##ly with the surface spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v and thus can interfere with the entry of the virus to its host cells . we achieved this by using a two - step screening method consisting of frontal affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy - mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry coupled with a viral infection ass ##ay based on a human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) - luc / sar ##s pseudo ##type ##d virus . two small molecules , te ##tra - o - gallo ##yl - β - d - glucose ( t ##gg ) and lu ##te ##olin , were identified , whose anti - sar ##s - co ##v activities were confirmed by using a wild - type sar ##s - co ##v infection system . t ##gg exhibits prominent anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity with a 50 % effective concentration of 4 . 5 μ ##m and a selective index of 240 . 0 . the two - step screening method described here yielded several small molecules that can be used for developing new classes of anti - sar ##s - co ##v drugs and is potentially useful for the high - through ##put screening of drugs inhibit ##ing the entry of hiv , hepatitis c virus , and other ins ##idi ##ous viruses into their host cells .  
human rec ##om ##bina ##nt fa ##b fragments specific for the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were screened from a human fa ##b library , which was generated from rna ##s from peripheral l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes of con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients . among 50 randomly picked clones , 12 fa ##bs specially reacted with s protein by an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . the micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##izing test showed that one clone , designated m1 ##a , had neutral ##izing activity on ve ##ro e ##6 cells against sar ##s - co ##v . dna sequence analysis indicated that the light - and heavy - chain genes of m1 ##a fa ##b belong to the κ ##2 ##a and 4 ##f families , respectively . a neutral ##izing test on pu ##rified m1 ##a demonstrated that 0 . 5 mg / ml of m1 ##a completely inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v activity , with an absence of cy ##top ##athic effect for 7 days . real - time flu ##orescence reverse transcription - pc ##r also proved the neutral ##izing capacity of m1 ##a . these data showed that the number of virus copies was significantly reduced in the m1 ##a - treated group , suggesting an important role for m1 ##a in passive im ##mun ##op ##rop ##hyl ##ax ##is against the sar ##s virus .  
while the novel middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is closely related to ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is bat co ##v hk ##u ##4 ( ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 ) and pip ##ist ##rell ##us bat co ##v hk ##u ##5 ( pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 ) in bats from hong kong , and other potential lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in bats from africa , europe , and america , its animal origin remains obscure . to better understand the role of bats in its origin , we examined the molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and evolution of lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es among bats . ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 and pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 were detected in 29 % and 25 % of ali ##ment ##ary samples from lesser bamboo bat ( ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is pac ##hy ##pus ) and japanese pip ##ist ##rell ##e ( pip ##ist ##rell ##us ab ##ram ##us ) , respectively . sequencing of their rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) , spike ( s ) , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) genes revealed that mer ##s - co ##v is more closely related to pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 in rd ##rp ( 92 . 1 % to 92 . 3 % amino acid [ aa ] identity ) but is more closely related to ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 in s ( 66 . 8 % to 67 . 4 % aa identity ) and n ( 71 . 9 % to 72 . 3 % aa identity ) . although both viruses were under pu ##ri ##fying selection , the s of pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 displayed marked sequence poly ##morphism ##s and more positively selected sites than that of ty - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##4 , suggesting that pi - bat ##co ##v hk ##u ##5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niche ##s along with its host in diverse habitats . molecular clock analysis showed that they diver ##ged from a common ancestor with mer ##s - co ##v at least several centuries ago . although mer ##s - co ##v may have diver ##ged from potential lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in european bats more recently , these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of mer ##s - co ##v . intensive surveillance for lineage c beta ##co ##vs in pip ##ist ##rell ##us and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the middle east may fill the evolutionary gap .  
we evaluated the efficacy of r ##hes ##us theta - def ##ens ##in 1 ( rt ##d - 1 ) , a novel cyclic anti ##mic ##ro ##bial peptide , as a prop ##hyl ##actic anti ##vira ##l in a mouse model of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) lung disease . bal ##b / c mice exposed to a mouse - adapted strain of sar ##s - co ##v demonstrated 100 % survival and modest reductions in lung pathology without reductions in virus ti ##ter when treated with two intra ##nas ##al doses of rt ##d - 1 , while mortality in un ##tre ##ated mice was [UNK] % . rt ##d - 1 - treated , sar ##s - co ##v - infected mice displayed altered lung tissue cy ##tok ##ine responses 2 and 4 days post ##in ##fect ##ion compared to those of un ##tre ##ated animals , suggesting that one possible mechanism of action for rt ##d - 1 is im ##mun ##omo ##du ##lat ##ory .  
corona ##virus ##es are a family of enveloped , single - stranded , positive - strand rna viruses classified within the ni ##do ##vira ##les order . this corona ##virus family consists of pathogen ##s of many animal species and of humans , including the recently isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . this review is divided into two main parts ; the first concerns the animal corona ##virus ##es and their pathogen ##esis , with an emphasis on the functions of individual viral genes , and the second discusses the newly described human emerging pathogen , sar ##s - co ##v . the corona ##virus part covers ( i ) a description of a group of corona ##virus ##es and the diseases they cause , including the prototype corona ##virus , mu ##rine hepatitis virus , which is one of the recognized animal models for multiple sc ##ler ##osis , as well as viruses of veterinary importance that in ##fect the pig , chicken , and cat and a summary of the human viruses ; ( ii ) a short summary of the replication cycle of corona ##virus ##es in cell culture ; ( iii ) the development and application of reverse genetics systems ; and ( iv ) the roles of individual corona ##virus proteins in replication and pathogen ##esis . the sar ##s - co ##v part covers the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s , the developing animal models for infection , and the progress in vaccine development and anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies . the data gathered on the animal corona ##virus ##es continue to be helpful in understanding sar ##s - co ##v .  
proof that a newly identified corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) came from a series of studies on experimental ##ly infected cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca fa ##sc ##icular ##is ) . sar ##s - co ##v - infected mac ##aq ##ues developed a disease comparable to sar ##s in humans ; the virus was re - isolated from these animals and they developed sar ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies . this completed the fu ##lf ##il ##ment of koch ' s post ##ulates , as modified by rivers for viral diseases , for sar ##s - co ##v as the ae ##ti ##ological agent of sar ##s . besides the mac ##aq ##ue model , a fe ##rret and a cat model for sar ##s - co ##v were also developed . these animal models allow comparative pathogen ##esis studies for sar ##s - co ##v infections and testing of different intervention strategies . the first of these studies has shown that peg ##yla ##ted inter ##fer ##on - alpha , a drug approved for human use , limits sar ##s - co ##v replication and lung damage in experimental ##ly infected mac ##aq ##ues . finally , we argue that , given the worldwide nature of the socio - economic changes that have pre ##dis ##posed for the emergence of sar ##s and av ##ian influenza in southeast asia , such changes herald the beginning of a global trend for which we are ill prepared .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) recently spread from an animal reservoir to in ##fect humans , causing sporadic severe and frequently fatal respiratory disease . appropriate public health and control measures will require discovery of the zoo ##not ##ic mer ##s corona ##virus reservoirs . the relevant animal hosts are liable to be those that offer optimal mer ##s virus cell entry . cell entry begins with virus spike ( s ) protein binding to d ##pp ##4 receptors . we constructed chi ##meric d ##pp ##4 receptors that have the virus - binding domains of indigenous middle eastern animals and assessed the activities of these receptors in supporting s protein binding and virus entry . human , camel , and horse receptors were potent and nearly equally effective mer ##s virus receptors , while goat and bat receptors were considerably less effective . these patterns reflected s protein af ##fin ##ities for the receptors . however , even the low - affinity receptors could hyper ##sen ##sit ##ize cells to infection when an s - cl ##ea ##ving pro ##tea ##se ( s ) was present , indicating that affinity threshold ##s for virus entry must be considered in the context of host - cell pro ##te ##ol ##ytic environments . these findings suggest that virus receptors and s protein - cl ##ea ##ving pro ##tea ##ses combine in a variety of animals to offer efficient virus entry and that several middle eastern animals are potential reservoirs for transmitting mer ##s - co ##v to humans . importance mer ##s is a frequently fatal disease that is caused by a zoo ##not ##ic co ##v . the animals transmitting mer ##s - co ##v to humans are not yet known . infection by mer ##s - co ##v requires receptors and pro ##tea ##ses on host cells . we compared the receptors of humans and middle eastern animals and found that human , camel , and horse receptors sen ##sit ##ized cells to mer ##s - co ##v infection more robust ##ly than goat and bat receptors . infection su ##sc ##ept ##ibility correlated with af ##fin ##ities of the receptors for viral spike proteins . we also found that the presence of a cell surface lung pro ##tea ##se greatly increases su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to mer ##s - co ##v , particularly in conjunction with low - affinity receptors . this catalog ##uing of human and animal host cell factors allows one to make inference ##s on the distribution of mer ##s - co ##v in nature .  
the outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections and diseases represents a potential threat for worldwide spread and requires development of effective therapeutic strategies . in this study , we revealed a novel positive function of an exchange protein directly activated by cyclic amp 1 ( camp - 1 ; epa ##c - 1 ) on mer ##s - co ##v replication . specifically , we have shown that epa ##c - specific inhibitor treatment or si ##len ##cing epa ##c - 1 gene expression rendered cells resistant to viral infection . we believe epa ##c - 1 inhibitors deserve further study as potential therapeutic agents for mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
inter ##fer ##on - induced trans ##me ##mb ##rane proteins ( if ##it ##ms ) are restriction factors that inhibit the infectious entry of many enveloped rna viruses . however , we demonstrated previously that human if ##it ##m ##2 and if ##it ##m ##3 are essential host factors facilitating the entry of human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) o ##c ##43 . in a continuing effort to dec ##ip ##her the molecular mechanism underlying if ##it ##m differential modulation of hc ##ov entry , we investigated the roles of structural motifs important for if ##it ##m protein post ##tra ##ns ##lation ##al modifications , intra ##cellular trafficking , and ol ##igo ##mer ##ization in mod ##ulating the entry of five hc ##ov ##s . we found that three distinct mutations in if ##it ##m ##1 or if ##it ##m ##3 converted the host restriction factors to enhance entry driven by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and / or middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . first , replacement of if ##it ##m ##3 ty ##ros ##ine 20 with either alan ##ine or as ##par ##tic acid to mimic un ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated or ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated if ##it ##m ##3 reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 and - 229 ##e but enhanced the entry of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . second , replacement of if ##it ##m ##3 ty ##ros ##ine 99 with either alan ##ine or as ##par ##tic acid reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 and sar ##s - co ##v but promoted the entry of mer ##s - co ##v . third , del ##eti ##on of the car ##box ##yl - terminal 12 amino acid residues from if ##it ##m ##1 enhanced the entry of mer ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 . these findings suggest that these residues and structural motifs of if ##it ##m proteins are key deter ##mina ##nts for mod ##ulating the entry of hc ##ov ##s , most likely through interaction with viral and / or host cellular components at the site of viral entry to mod ##ulate the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membranes . importance the differential effects of if ##it ##m proteins on the entry of hc ##ov ##s that utilize diver ##gent entry pathways and membrane fusion mechanisms even when using the same receptor make the hc ##ov ##s a valuable system for comparative investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying if ##it ##m restriction or promotion of virus entry into host cells . identification of three distinct mutations that converted if ##it ##m ##1 or if ##it ##m ##3 from inhibitors to enhance ##rs of mer ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v spike protein - mediated entry revealed key structural
different ass ##ays were used to analyze 1 , 62 ##1 serum specimens collected from military recruits from the people ' s republic of china in 2002 for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus antibodies . the results demonstrated that the subjects either had rarely been exposed to the virus before the 2003 sar ##s outbreak or had not been exposed but the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein cross - reacted with other antibodies in humans .  
the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) media ##tes the receptor interaction and immune recognition and is considered a major target for vaccine design . however , its antigen ##ic and im ##mun ##ogenic properties remain to be el ##uc ##ida ##ted . in this study , we im ##mun ##ized mice with full - length s protein ( fl - s ) or its extra ##cellular domain ( ec - s ) expressed by rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus ##es in insect cells . we found that the im ##mun ##ized mice developed high ti ##ters of anti - s antibodies with potent neutral ##izing activities against sar ##s pseudo ##virus ##es constructed with the s proteins of tor ##2 , g ##d ##0 ##3 ##t ##13 , and s ##z ##3 , the representative strains of 2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 human sar ##s - co ##v and palm ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v , respectively . these data suggest that the rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus - expressed s protein vaccines possess excellent im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity , thereby inducing highly potent neutral ##izing responses against human and animal sar ##s - co ##v variants . the antigen ##ic structure of the s protein was characterized by a panel of 38 mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) isolated from the im ##mun ##ized mice . the ep ##ito ##pes of most anti - s mab ##s ( 32 of 38 ) were localized within the s ##1 domain , and those of the remaining 6 mab ##s were mapped to the s ##2 domain . among the anti - s ##1 mab ##s , 17 mab ##s targeted the n - terminal region ( amino acids [ aa ] 12 to 327 ) , 9 mab ##s recognized the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ; aa 318 to 510 ) , and 6 mab ##s reacted with the c - terminal region of s ##1 domain that contains the major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant site ( aa 52 ##8 to 63 ##5 ) . striking ##ly , all of the rb ##d - specific mab ##s had potent neutral ##izing activity , 6 of which efficiently blocked the receptor binding , confirming that the rb ##d contains the main neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes and that block ##age of the receptor association is the major mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##ization . five mab ##s specific for the s ##1 n - terminal region exhibited moderate neutral ##izing activity , but none of the mab ##s reacting with the s ##2 domain and the major im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant site in s ##1 showed neutral ##izing activity . all of the neutral ##izing mab ##s recognize conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes . these data provide important information for understanding the antigen
the corona ##virus spike protein ( s ) plays a key role in the early steps of viral infection , with the s ##1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the s ##2 domain media ##ting membrane fusion . in some cases , the s protein is pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally cl ##ea ##ved at the s ##1 – s ##2 boundary . in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , it has been shown that virus entry requires the end ##osomal pro ##tea ##se cat ##he ##ps ##in l ; however , it was also found that infection of sar ##s - co ##v could be strongly induced by try ##ps ##in treatment . overall , in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion , pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the sar ##s - co ##v s protein remains unclear . here , we identify a pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage site within the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 domain ( s ##2 ′ , r ##7 ##9 ##7 ) . mutation of r ##7 ##9 ##7 specifically inhibit ##ed try ##ps ##in - dependent fusion in both cell – cell fusion and pseudo ##vir ##ion entry ass ##ays . we also introduced a fur ##in cleavage site at both the s ##2 ′ cleavage site within s ##2 79 ##3 - k ##pt ##kr - 79 ##7 ( s ##2 ′ ) , as well as at the junction of s ##1 and s ##2 . introduction of a fur ##in cleavage site at the s ##2 ′ position allowed try ##ps ##in - independent cell – cell fusion , which was strongly increased by the presence of a second fur ##in cleavage site at the s ##1 – s ##2 position . taken together , these data suggest a novel pri ##ming mechanism for a viral fusion protein , with a critical pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage event on the sar ##s - co ##v s protein at position 79 ##7 ( s ##2 ′ ) , acting in concert with the s ##1 – s ##2 cleavage site to media ##te membrane fusion and virus in ##fect ##ivity .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected at least 1 , 08 ##2 people , including 43 ##9 fatalities . so far , no empirical virus isolation study has been done to el ##uc ##ida ##te infectious virus secret ##ion or ser ##otype variability . here , we used 51 respiratory samples from 32 patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection for virus isolation in ve ##ro b ##4 and ca ##co - 2 cells . we found ca ##co - 2 cells to significantly enhance isolation success over routinely used ve ##ro cells . isolation success correlated with viral rna concentration and time after diagnosis as well as with the amount of i ##ga antibodies secret ##ed in respiratory samples used for isolation . results from plaque reduction neutral ##ization ass ##ays using a representative range of serum samples and virus isolate ##s suggested that all circulating human mer ##s - co ##v strains represent one single ser ##otype . the choice of prototype strain is not likely to influence the success of candidate mer ##s - co ##v vaccines . however , vaccine formulation ##s should be evaluated for their potential to induce i ##ga .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) known as sar ##s - co ##v , is a con ##tag ##ious and life - threatening respiratory illness with p ##ne ##um ##ocytes as its main target . a full understanding of how sar ##s - co ##v would interact with lung ep ##ith ##elial cells will be vital for advancing our knowledge of sar ##s pathogen ##esis . however , an in vitro model of sar ##s - co ##v infection using relevant lung ep ##ith ##elial cells is not yet available , making it difficult to di ##sse ##ct the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v in the lungs . here , we report that sar ##s - co ##v can productive ##ly in ##fect human bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cal ##u - 3 cells , causing cy ##top ##athic effects , a process reflective of its natural course of infection in the lungs . indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence studies revealed a prefer ##ential expression of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace - 2 ) , the functional receptor of sar ##s - co ##v , on the apical surface . importantly , both ace - 2 and viral antigen appeared to prefer ##ential ##ly col ##oca ##li ##ze at the apical domain of infected cells . in highly polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 cells grown on the membrane insert ##s , we found that cells exposed to virus through the apical rather than the bas ##olate ##ral surface showed high levels of viral replication . pro ##geny virus was released into the apical chamber at ti ##ters up to 5 logs higher than those recovered from the bas ##olate ##ral chambers of polar ##ized cultures . taken together , these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v almost exclusively entered and was released from the apical domain of polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 cells , which might provide important insight into the mechanism of transmission and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious and highly con ##tag ##ious disease that is caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and for which there are currently no approved treatments . we report the discovery and characterization of small - molecule inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v replication that block viral entry by three different mechanisms . the compounds were discovered by screening a chemical library of compounds for blocking of entry of hiv - 1 pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein s ( sar ##s - s ) but not that of hiv - 1 pseudo ##type ##d with ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein g ( vs ##v - g ) . studies on their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms : ( i ) ss ##aa ##0 ##9 ##e ##2 { n - [ [ 4 - ( 4 - methyl ##pipe ##raz ##in - 1 - y ##l ) ph ##en ##yl ] methyl ] - 1 , 2 - ox ##az ##ole - 5 - car ##box ##ami ##de } acts through a novel mechanism of action , by blocking early interactions of sar ##s - s with the receptor for sar ##s - co ##v , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) ; ( ii ) ss ##aa ##0 ##9 ##e ##1 { [ ( z ) - 1 - th ##io ##ph ##en - 2 - y ##let ##hyl ##ide ##nea ##min ##o ] th ##io ##ure ##a } acts later , by blocking cat ##he ##ps ##in l , a host pro ##tea ##se required for processing of sar ##s - s during viral entry ; and ( iii ) ss ##aa ##0 ##9 ##e ##3 [ n - ( 9 , 10 - di ##ox ##o - 9 , 10 - di ##hy ##dro ##ant ##hra ##cen - 2 - y ##l ) benz ##ami ##de ] also acts later and does not affect interactions of sar ##s - s with ace ##2 or the en ##zy ##matic functions of cat ##he ##ps ##in l but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane . our work demonstrates that there are at least three independent strategies for blocking sar ##s - co ##v entry , valid ##ates these mechanisms of inhibition , and introduces promising leads for the development of sar ##s therapeutic ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus that causes a highly con ##tag ##ious respiratory disease , sar ##s , with significant mortality . while factors contributing to the highly pathogen ##ic nature of sar ##s - co ##v remain poorly understood , it has been reported that sar ##s - co ##v infection does not induce type i inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) in cell culture . however , it is uncertain whether sar ##s - co ##v evade ##s host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counter ##act innate host defenses . we show here that infection of sar ##s - co ##v triggers a weak if ##n response in culture ##d human lung / bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells without inducing the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of if ##n - regulatory factor 3 ( ir ##f - 3 ) , a late ##nt cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type i if ##n synthesis . furthermore , sar ##s - co ##v infection blocked the induction of if ##n anti ##vira ##l activity and the up ##re ##gul ##ation of protein expression of a subset of if ##n - stimulated genes triggered by ds ##rna or an unrelated para ##my ##x ##ov ##irus . in searching for a sar ##s - co ##v protein capable of counter ##act ##ing innate immunity , we identified the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) domain as a potent if ##n antagonist . the inhibition of the if ##n response does not require the pro ##tea ##se activity of pl ##pro . rather , pl ##pro interact ##s with ir ##f - 3 , and inhibit ##s the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and nuclear trans ##lo ##cation of ir ##f - 3 , thereby disrupt ##ing the activation of type i if ##n responses through either toll - like receptor 3 or re ##tino ##ic acid ind ##ucible gene i / mel ##ano ##ma differentiation - associated gene 5 pathways . our data suggest that regulation of ir ##f - 3 - dependent innate anti ##vira ##l defenses by pl ##pro may contribute to the establishment of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
most animal species that can be infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) do not rep ##rod ##uc ##ibly develop clinical disease , hind ##ering studies of pathogen ##esis . to develop an alternative system for the study of sar ##s - co ##v , we introduced individual sar ##s - co ##v genes ( open reading frames [ or ##fs ] ) into the genome of an at ##ten ##uated mu ##rine corona ##virus . one protein , the product of sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##6 , converted a sub ##let ##hal infection to a uniformly lethal en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is and enhanced virus growth in tissue culture cells , indicating that sar ##s - co ##v proteins function in the context of a het ##ero ##log ##ous corona ##virus infection . furthermore , these results suggest that the at ##ten ##uated mu ##rine corona ##virus lacks a vi ##ru ##lence gene residing in sar ##s - co ##v . rec ##om ##bina ##nt mu ##rine corona ##virus ##es cause a rep ##rod ##ucible and well - characterized clinical disease , offer virtually no risk to laboratory personnel , and should be useful for el ##uc ##ida ##ting the role of sar ##s - co ##v non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins in viral replication and pathogen ##esis .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerged infectious disease with a high case - fatal ##ity rate and devastating socio - economic impact . in this report we summarized the results from an ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigation of a sar ##s outbreak in a hospital in tianjin , between april and may 2003 . we collected ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of sar ##s associated with the outbreak . transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated . the outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters . all sar ##s cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people . the patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age ( mean age 38 · 5 years ) ; 38 · 7 % were men . the overall case fatal ##ity in the sar ##s outbreak was 11 · 7 % ( 13 / 111 ) . the outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified . sar ##s is a highly con ##tag ##ious condition associated with substantial case fatal ##ity ; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period . however , string ##ent public health measures seemed to be effective in breaking the disease transmission chain .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is associated with an outbreak of more than 90 cases of severe pneumonia with high mortality ( greater than 50 % ) . to date , there are no anti ##vira ##l drugs or specific the ##ra ##pies to treat mer ##s - co ##v . to rapidly identify potential inhibitors of mer ##s - co ##v replication , we expressed the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) and the 3 - ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) from mer ##s - co ##v and developed lucifer ##ase - based bio ##sen ##sor ##s to monitor pro ##tea ##se activity in cells . we show that the expressed mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro recognizes and processes the canonical co ##v - pl ##pro cleavage site r ##lk ##gg in the bio ##sen ##sor . however , existing co ##v pl ##pro inhibitors were unable to block mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro activity , likely due to the diver ##gence of the amino acid sequence in the drug binding site . to investigate mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro activity , we expressed the pro ##tea ##se in context with flanking non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 4 ( ns ##p ##4 ) and the amino - terminal portion of ns ##p ##6 and detected processing of the lucifer ##ase - based bio ##sen ##sor ##s containing the canonical 3 ##cl ##pro cleavage site vr ##l ##q ##s . importantly , we found that a small - molecule inhibitor that blocks replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v and mu ##rine co ##v also inhibit ##s the activity of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . overall , the pro ##tea ##se expression and bio ##sen ##sor ass ##ays developed here allow for rapid evaluation of viral pro ##tea ##se activity and the identification of pro ##tea ##se inhibitors . these bio ##sen ##sor ass ##ays can now be used to screen for mer ##s - co ##v - specific or broad - spectrum corona ##virus pl ##pro and 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitors .  
by using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein - based enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) and serum specimens serial ##ly collected ( from day 0 to day 240 after sy ##mpt ##om onset ) from patients with pneumonia due to sar ##s - co ##v , we analyzed the longitudinal profiles of im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) , i ##gm , and i ##ga antibodies against the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in patients with pneumonia due to sar ##s - co ##v . for i ##gg , the median optical density at 450 nm ( o ##d ( 450 ) ) turned positive at day 17 and a bi ##pha ##sic response was observed . at day 240 , all patients were still positive for anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein i ##gg antibody . for i ##gm , the median o ##d ( 450 ) turned positive at day 20 . 5 , peaked at about day 80 , and fell to below the baseline level at about day 180 . at day 240 , 36 % of the patients were still positive for anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein i ##gm antibody . for i ##ga , the median o ##d ( 450 ) turned positive at day 17 , peaked at about day 50 , and fell to below the baseline level at about day 180 . at day 240 , 36 % of the patients were still positive for anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein i ##ga antibody . the time of ser ##oco ##n ##version detected by the rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein - based elisa and that detected by indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay were similar . the median times of ser ##oco ##n ##version for i ##gg , i ##gm , and i ##ga detected by the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay were 17 days ( 17 days by elisa ) , 16 . 5 days ( 20 . 5 days by elisa ) , and 17 . 5 days ( 17 days by elisa ) , respectively , after disease onset . one , four , and one of the six patients who died did not produce any i ##gg , i ##gm , and i ##ga antibodies against the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v , respectively , although these antibodies were detected in all six patients by the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay . further studies should be performed to see whether sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein antibody po ##sit ##ivity has any pro ##gno ##stic significance .  
emerging viral infections are difficult to control as het ##ero ##gen ##eous members periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoo ##not ##ic hosts , com ##pl ##ica ##ting the development of specific anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies and vaccines . corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have a pro ##cl ##ivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease . sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v successively emerged causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in im ##mun ##ological ##ly naive human populations throughout the globe . broad - spectrum the ##ra ##pies capable of inhibit ##ing co ##v infections would address an immediate un ##met medical need and could be in ##val ##ua ##ble in the treatment of emerging and endemic co ##v infections . here we show that a nu ##cle ##otide pro ##dr ##ug gs - 57 ##34 , currently in clinical development for treatment of e ##bola virus disease , can inhibit sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v replication in multiple in vitro systems including primary human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cell cultures with sub ##mic ##rom ##olar ic ( 50 ) values . gs - 57 ##34 was also effective against bat - co ##vs , prep ##and ##emi ##c bat - co ##vs and circulating contemporary human co ##v in primary human lung cells , thus demonstrating broad - spectrum anti - co ##v activity . in a mouse model of sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , prop ##hyl ##actic and early therapeutic administration of gs - 57 ##34 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory functions . these data provide substantive evidence that gs - 57 ##34 may prove effective against endemic mer ##s - co ##v in the middle east , circulating human co ##v , and possibly most importantly , emerging co ##v of the future .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a newly identified member of the family corona ##vir ##idae and poses a serious public health threat . recent studies indicated that the sar ##s - co ##v viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is a class i viral fusion protein . a fusion peptide present at the n - terminal region of class i viral fusion proteins is believed to initiate viral and cell membrane interactions and subsequent fusion . although the sar ##s - co ##v fusion protein he ##pta ##d repeats have been well characterized , the fusion peptide has yet to be identified . based on the conserved features of known viral fusion peptide ##s and using wi ##ml ##ey and white inter ##fa ##cial hydro ##phobic ##ity plots , we have identified two put ##ative fusion peptide ##s ( sar ##s ( w ##w - i ) and sar ##s ( w ##w - ii ) ) at the n terminus of the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 subunit . both peptide ##s are hydro ##phobic and rich in alan ##ine , g ##ly ##cine , and / or ph ##en ##yla ##lani ##ne residues and contain a canonical fusion trip ##ept ##ide along with a central pro ##line residue . only the sar ##s ( w ##w - i ) peptide strongly partition ##ed into the membranes of large un ##ila ##mel ##lar ve ##sic ##les ( lu ##v ) , adopting a β - sheet structure . likewise , only sar ##s ( w ##w - i ) induced the fusion of lu ##v and caused membrane leak ##age of ve ##sic ##le contents at peptide / lip ##id ratios of 1 : 50 and 1 : 100 , respectively . the activity of this synthetic peptide appeared to be dependent on its amino acid ( aa ) sequence , as scrambling the peptide rendered it unable to partition into lu ##v , assume a defined secondary structure , or induce both fusion and leak ##age of lu ##v . based on the activity of sar ##s ( w ##w - i ) , we propose that the hydro ##phobic stretch of 19 aa corresponding to residues 770 to 78 ##8 is a fusion peptide of the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 subunit .  
bats harbor a large diversity of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , several of which are related to zoo ##not ##ic pathogen ##s that cause severe disease in humans . our screening of bat samples collected in kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected rna from several novel co ##vs but , more significantly , identified sequences that were closely related to human co ##vs nl ##6 ##3 and 229 ##e , suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats . we also demonstrated that human co ##v nl ##6 ##3 is a rec ##om ##bina ##nt between nl ##6 ##3 - like viruses circulating in tri ##ae ##no ##ps bats and 229 ##e - like viruses circulating in hip ##po ##side ##ros bats , with the break ##point located near 5 ′ and 3 ′ ends of the spike ( s ) protein gene . in addition , two further inter ##sp ##ec ##ies rec ##om ##bina ##tion events involving the s gene were identified , suggesting that this region may represent a rec ##om ##bina ##tion “ hot spot ” in co ##v genome ##s . finally , using a combination of phylogenetic and distance - based approaches , we showed that the genetic diversity of bat co ##vs is primarily structured by host species and subsequently by geographic distances . importance understanding the driving forces of cross - species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of disease emergence . previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate reservoir hosts for a number of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , including ancestors of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and human co ##v 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) . however , the evolutionary pathways of bat co ##vs remain elusive . we provide evidence for natural rec ##om ##bina ##tion between distant ##ly related african bat corona ##virus ##es associated with tri ##ae ##no ##ps af ##er and hip ##po ##side ##ros sp . bats that resulted in a nl ##6 ##3 - like virus , an ancestor of the human pathogen hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 . these results suggest that inter ##sp ##ec ##ies rec ##om ##bina ##tion may play an important role in co ##v evolution and the emergence of novel co ##vs with zoo ##not ##ic potential .  
we report the development of an im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin m ( i ##gm ) antibody capture enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( mac - elisa ) for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) by using rec ##om ##bina ##nt truncated sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein as the antigen . the newly developed mac - elisa had a specific ##ity and sensitivity of 100 % as evaluated by using sera from healthy volunteers and patients with laboratory - confirmed sar ##s . using serial serum samples collected from sar ##s patients , the times to ser ##oco ##n ##version were determined by i ##gm antibody detection after sar ##s - co ##v infection . the median time to ser ##oco ##n ##version detection was 8 days ( range , 5 to 17 days ) after disease onset , and the ser ##oco ##n ##version rates after the onset of illness were 33 % by the first week , 97 % by the second week , and 100 % by the third week . compared with the results of our previous report on the detection of i ##gg , the median ser ##oco ##n ##version time by i ##gm detection was 3 days earlier and the ser ##oco ##n ##version rate by the second week after the illness for i ##gm was significantly higher than by i ##gg ass ##ay . our results indicating that the i ##gm response appears earlier than i ##gg after sar ##s - co ##v infection in consistent with those for other pathogen ##s . our newly developed mac - elisa system offers a new alternative for the confirmation of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes sar ##s . the pathogen ##ic mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v remain poorly understood . six cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus monkeys were in ##oc ##ulated with the hk ##u ##39 ##8 ##49 isolate of sar ##s - co ##v via four routes . after intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation , the virus was isolated from respiratory sw ##ab ##s on days 2 – 7 post ##ino ##cula ##tion ( p . i . ) and virus genome was detected in int ##estinal tissues on day 7 p . i . virus was not detected after intra ##gas ##tric in ##oc ##ulation . after intra ##ven ##ous in ##oc ##ulation , infectious virus was isolated from rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s , and virus antigen was detected in int ##estinal cells on day 14 p . i . after intra ##tra ##che ##al ( i . t . ) in ##oc ##ulation , virus antigen - positive al ##ve ##olar cells and macro ##pha ##ges were found in lung and infectious virus was detected in l ##ym ##ph ##oid and int ##estinal tissues . the per ##ib ##ron ##chia ##l l ##ym ##ph nodes showed evidence of an immune response . lung tissue and / or fluid and / or the per ##ib ##ron ##chia ##l l ##ym ##ph node of the intra ##tra ##che ##ally in ##oc ##ulated animals had high tn ##f - α , il - 8 and il - 12 levels . sar ##s lung lesions are only generated in monkeys by i . t . in ##oc ##ulation . the virus appears to spread into and perhaps via the int ##estinal and l ##ym ##pha ##tic systems . it has been suggested previously that vi ##rae ##mia may cause int ##estinal infections in sar ##s patients .  
the spike protein ( s ) , a membrane component of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is anticipated to be an important component of candidate vaccines . we constructed rec ##om ##bina ##nt forms of the highly at ##ten ##uated modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) containing the gene encoding full - length sar ##s - co ##v s with and without a c - terminal ep ##ito ##pe tag called mv ##a / s - ha and mv ##a / s , respectively . cells infected with mv ##a / so ##r mv ##a / s - ha synthesized a 200 - k ##da protein , which was recognized by antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of sar ##s - co ##v s or the ep ##ito ##pe tag in western b ##lot analyses . further studies indicated that s was n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted and migrated in sd ##s poly ##ac ##ryl ##ami ##de gel ##s with an apparent mass of ≈ ##16 ##0 k ##da after treatment with peptide n - g ##ly ##cos ##ida ##se f . the acquisition of resistance to end ##og ##ly ##cos ##ida ##se h indicated trafficking of s to the medial go ##l ##gi compartment , and con ##fo ##cal microscopy showed that s was transported to the cell surface . intra ##nas ##al or intra ##mus ##cular in ##oc ##ulation ##s of bal ##b / c mice with mv ##a / s produced serum antibodies that recognized the sar ##s s in elisa and neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v in vitro . moreover , mv ##a / s administered by either route eli ##cite ##d protective immunity , as shown by reduced ti ##ters of sar ##s - co ##v in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice after challenge . passive transfer of serum from mice im ##mun ##ized with mv ##a / s to naive mice also reduced the replication of sar ##s - co ##v in the respiratory tract after challenge , demonstrating a role for antibody to s in protection . the at ##ten ##uated nature of mv ##a and the ability of mv ##a / s to induce neutral ##izing antibody that protects mice support further development of this candidate vaccine .  
in this era of continued emergence of zoo ##not ##ic virus infections , the rapid development of rode ##nt models represents a critical barrier to public health prepared ##ness , including the testing of anti ##virus therapy and vaccines . the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was recently identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a severe pneumonia . given the ability of corona ##virus to rapidly adapt to new hosts , a major public health concern is that mer ##s - co ##v will further adapt to replication in humans , triggering a pan ##de ##mic . no small - animal model for this infection is currently available , but studies suggest that virus entry factors can con ##fer virus su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . here , we show that mice were sen ##sit ##ized to mer ##s - co ##v infection by prior trans ##duction with aden ##ov ##ira ##l vectors expressing the human host - cell receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 . mice developed a pneumonia characterized by extensive inflammatory - cell in ##filtration with virus clearance occurring 6 – 8 d after infection . clinical disease and his ##top ##ath ##ological changes were more severe in the absence of type - i if ##n signaling whereas the t - cell response was required for virus clearance . using these mice , we demonstrated the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention ( poly i : c ) and a potential vaccine [ venezuelan e ##quin ##e en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is rep ##lic ##on particles expressing mer ##s - co ##v spike protein ] . we also found little protective cross - react ##ivity between mer ##s - co ##v and the severe acute respiratory syndrome - co ##v . our results demonstrate that this system will be useful for mer ##s - co ##v studies and for the rapid development of relevant animal models for emerging respiratory viral infections .  
between september 2012 and january 20 , 2017 , the world health organization ( who ) received reports from 27 countries of 1879 laboratory - confirmed cases in humans of the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by infection with the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and at least 65 ##9 related deaths . cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection continue to occur , including sporadic zoo ##not ##ic infections in humans across the arabian peninsula , occasional import ##ations and associated clusters in other regions , and outbreak ##s of non ##sus ##tained human - to - human transmission in health care settings . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are considered to be the most likely source of animal - to - human transmission . mer ##s - co ##v enters host cells after binding the dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp - 4 ) receptor and the car ##cino ##em ##bry ##onic antigen – related cell - ad ##hesion molecule 5 ( ce ##aca ##m ##5 ) co ##fa ##ctor ligand , and it replicate ##s efficiently in the human respiratory ep ##ith ##eli ##um . illness begins after an inc ##uba ##tion period of 2 to 14 days and frequently results in h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c respiratory failure and the need for multi ##org ##an support . however , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mild cases also occur . real - time reverse - transcription – polymer ##ase - chain - reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) testing of respiratory secret ##ions is the main ##sta ##y for diagnosis , and samples from the lower respiratory tract have the greatest yield among seriously ill patients . there is no anti ##vira ##l therapy of proven efficacy , and thus treatment remains largely supportive ; potential vaccines are at an early developmental stage . there are multiple gaps in knowledge regarding the evolution and transmission of the virus , disease pathogen ##esis , treatment , and prospects for a vaccine . the ongoing occurrence of mer ##s in humans and the associated high mortality call for a continued collaborative approach toward gaining a better understanding of the infection both in humans and in animals . mer ##s - co ##v was first identified in september 2012 ##1 in a patient from saudi arabia who had h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c respiratory failure and multi ##org ##an illness . subsequent cases have included infections in humans across the arabian peninsula , occasional import ##ations and associated clusters in other regions , and outbreak ##s of non ##sus ##tained human - to - human transmission in health care settings ( fig . 1 ) .  
in 2012 , a zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , called mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . since then , the virus has infected 1728 patients as of 12 may 2016 , with a mortality rate of 36 % . while mer ##s - co ##v generally causes sub ##cl ##ini ##cal or mild disease , infection can result in serious outcomes , including acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and multi - organ failure in patients with co - mor ##bid ##ities . the virus is endemic in camel ##s in the arabian peninsula and africa and thus poses a consistent threat of frequent rein ##tro ##duction into human populations . disease prevalence will increase substantially if the virus mu ##tate ##s to increase human - to - human trans ##mis ##sibility . no therapeutic ##s or vaccines are approved for mer ##s ; thus , development of novel the ##ra ##pies is needed . further , since many mer ##s cases are acquired in healthcare settings , public health measures and sc ##rup ##ulous attention to infection control practices are required to prevent additional mer ##s outbreak ##s .  
background : although sar ##s had been with a controversial topic for a decade at the time of this study , numerous sar ##s survivors had not yet physically , psychological ##ly or socially recovered from the aftermath of sar ##s . among chronic ##ally ill patients , the use of complementary and alternative medicine ( cam ) is reported to be widespread . however , extremely little is known about the use of cam by sar ##s survivors in the post ‐ sar ##s period and even less is known about how the use of cam is related to the unpleasant social and medical ‐ treatment experiences of sar ##s survivors , their eager ##ness to re ‐ establish social networks , and their awareness to prepare for future epidemic ##s . objective : to investigate the motivation ##s for pr ##act ##ising tai chi among sar ##s survivors in post ‐ sar ##s hong kong . design , setting and participants : using a qu ##ali ##tative approach , i conducted individual semi ‐ structured interviews with 35 sar ##s survivors , who were pu ##rp ##osi ##vel ##y sampled from a tai chi class of a sar ##s ‐ patient self ‐ help group in hong kong . results : health concerns and social experiences motivated the participants to pr ##act ##ise tai chi in post ‐ sar ##s hong kong . experiencing health deterioration in relation to sar ##s ‐ associated sequel ##ae , coping with unpleasant experiences during follow ‐ up biomedical treatments , a desire to regain an active role in recovery and rehabilitation , overcoming sar ##s ‐ associated stigma ##s by establishing a new social network and preparing for potential future stigma ##ti ##zation and discrimination were the key mo ##tiv ##ators for them . conclusion : the participants practised tai chi not only because they sought to improve their health but also because it provided a crucial social function and meaning to them .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system . although a novel corona ##virus has been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s , the pathogen ##ic mechanisms of sar ##s are not understood . in this study , sera were collected from healthy donors , patients with sar ##s , patients with severe sar ##s , and patients with sar ##s in con ##vale ##sc ##ence . the serum concentrations of inter ##le ##uki ##n - 1 ( il - 1 ) , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 , tumor growth factor beta ( t ##gf - β ) , tumor nec ##rosis factor alpha ( tn ##f - α ) , and gamma inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - γ ) were measured by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ) . the concentrations of il - 1 and tn ##f - α were not significantly different in different groups . the il - 6 concentration was increased in sar ##s patients and was significantly elevated in severe sar ##s patients , but the il - 6 concentrations were similar in con ##vale ##scent patients and control subjects , suggesting that there was a positive relationship between the serum il - 6 concentration and sar ##s severity . the concentrations of il - 8 and t ##gf - β were decreased in sar ##s patients and significantly reduced in severe sar ##s patients , but they were comparable in con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients and control subjects , suggesting that there was a negative relationship between the il - 8 and t ##gf - β concentrations and sar ##s severity . the concentrations of if ##n - γ , il - 4 , and il - 10 showed significant changes only in con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients . the if ##n - γ and il - 4 levels were decreased , while the levels of il - 10 were increased , and the differences between con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients and other patient groups were statistical ##ly significant . these results suggest that there are different im ##mun ##ore ##gul ##atory events during and after sar ##s and may contribute to our understanding of the pathogen ##esis of this syndrome .  
the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activate ##s the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) on the cell surface following receptor binding during viral entry into cells . in the absence of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , sar ##s - co ##v achieve ##s cell entry via an end ##osomal pathway in which cat ##he ##ps ##in l may play an important role , i . e . , the activation of spike protein fu ##so ##genic ##ity . this study shows that a commercial ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se inhibitor ( cam ##osta ##t ) partially blocked infection by sar ##s - co ##v and human corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 ( hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 ) in he ##la cells expressing the receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . simultaneous treatment of the cells with cam ##osta ##t and est [ ( 23 , 25 ) trans - ep ##ox ##ys ##ucci ##ny ##l - l - le ##uc ##yla ##mind ##o - 3 - methyl ##bu ##tan ##e et ##hyl este ##r ] , a cat ##he ##ps ##in inhibitor , efficiently prevented both cell entry and the multi ##ste ##p growth of sar ##s - co ##v in human cal ##u - 3 air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . this efficient inhibition could be attributed to the dual blockade of entry from the cell surface and through the end ##osomal pathway . these observations suggest cam ##osta ##t as a candidate anti ##vira ##l drug to prevent or de ##press t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - dependent infection by sar ##s - co ##v .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an illness caused by a corona ##virus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness . a person can be infected through close contacts . this is an outbreak investigation report of the first confirmed mer ##s case in the philippines and the subsequent contact tracing activities . methods : review of patient records and interviews with health - care personnel were done . patient and close contacts were tested for mer ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) by real time - polymer ##ase chain reaction . close contacts were identified and categorized . all traced contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case . a standard log sheet was used for sy ##mpt ##om monitoring . results : the case was a 31 - year - old female who was a health - care worker in saudi arabia . she had mild acute respiratory illness five days before travelling to the philippines . on 1 february , she travelled with her husband to the philippines while she had a fever . on 2 february , she attended a health facility in the philippines . on 8 february , respiratory samples were tested for mer ##s - co ##v and yielded positive results . a total of 44 ##9 close contacts were identified , and 297 ( 66 % ) were traced . of those traced , 15 developed respiratory symptoms . all of them tested negative for mer ##s . discussion : in this outbreak investigation , the participation of health - care personnel in conducting vigorous contact tracing may have reduced the risk of transmission . however , being overly cautious to include more contacts for the outbreak response should be further rec ##ons ##ider ##ed .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) ns ##p ##1 protein has unique biological functions that have not been described in the viral proteins of any rna viruses ; expressed sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 protein has been found to suppress host gene expression by promoting host mrna degradation and inhibit ##ing translation . we generated an ns ##p ##1 mutant ( ns ##p ##1 - mt ) that neither promoted host mrna degradation nor suppressed host protein synthesis in expressing cells . both a sar ##s - co ##v mutant virus , encoding the ns ##p ##1 - mt protein ( sar ##s - co ##v - mt ) , and a wild - type virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - w ##t ) replicate ##d efficiently and exhibited similar one - step growth kinetic ##s in susceptible cells . both viruses accumulated similar amounts of virus - specific mrna ##s and ns ##p ##1 protein in infected cells , whereas the amounts of end ##ogen ##ous host mrna ##s were clearly higher in sar ##s - co ##v - mt - infected cells than in sar ##s - co ##v - w ##t - infected cells , in both the presence and absence of act ##ino ##my ##cin d . further , sar ##s - co ##v - w ##t replication strongly inhibit ##ed host protein synthesis , whereas host protein synthesis inhibition in sar ##s - co ##v - mt - infected cells was not as efficient as in sar ##s - co ##v - w ##t - infected cells . these data revealed that ns ##p ##1 indeed promoted host mrna degradation and contributed to host protein translation inhibition in infected cells . notably , sar ##s - co ##v - mt infection , but not sar ##s - co ##v - w ##t infection , induced high levels of beta inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) mrna accumulation and high ti ##ters of type i if ##n production . these data demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 suppressed host innate immune functions , including type i if ##n expression , in infected cells and suggested that sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 most probably plays a critical role in sar ##s - co ##v vi ##ru ##lence .  
a novel human middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) caused outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like illness with a high mortality rate , raising concerns of its pan ##de ##mic potential . dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) was recently identified as its receptor . here we showed that residues 37 ##7 to 66 ##2 in the s protein of mer ##s - co ##v specifically bound to d ##pp ##4 - expressing cells and soluble d ##pp ##4 protein and induced significant neutral ##izing antibody responses , suggesting that this region contains the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , which has a potential to be developed as a mer ##s - co ##v vaccine .  
objective : to estimate the infection curve of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) using the back projection method and to assess the effectiveness of interventions . design : statistical method . data : the daily reported number of sar ##s and interventions taken by hong kong special administrative region ( hk ##sar ) up to 24 june 2003 are used . method : to use a back projection technique to construct the infection curve of sar ##s in hong kong . the estimated epidemic curve is studied to identify the major events and to assess the effectiveness of interventions over the course of the epidemic . results : the sar ##s infection curve in hong kong is constructed for the period 1 march 2003 to 24 june 2003 . some interventions seem to be effective while others apparently have little or no effect . the infections among the medical and health workers are high . conclusions : qu ##aran ##tine of the close contacts of confirmed and suspected sar ##s cases seems to be the most effective intervention against spread of sar ##s in the community . thorough di ##sin ##fect ##ion of the infected area against environmental hazards is helpful . infections within hospitals can be reduced by better isolation measures and protective equipment ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a high - risk infectious pathogen . in the proposed model of respiratory failure , sar ##s - co ##v down - regulates its receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , but the mechanism involved is unknown . we found that the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - s ) induced tn ##f - α - converting enzyme ( ta ##ce ) - dependent shed ##ding of the ace ##2 ec ##to ##dom ##ain . the modulation of ta ##ce activity by sar ##s - s depended on the cy ##top ##las ##mic domain of ace ##2 , because del ##eti ##on mutants of ace ##2 lacking the car ##box ##yl - terminal region did not induce ace ##2 shed ##ding or tn ##f - α production . in contrast , the spike protein of h ##nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v ( nl ##6 ##3 - s ) , a co ##v that uses ace ##2 as a receptor and mainly induce ##s the common cold , caused neither of these cellular responses . intriguing ##ly , viral infection , judged by real - time rt - pc ##r analysis of sar ##s - co ##v mrna expression , was significantly at ##ten ##uated by del ##eti ##on of the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of ace ##2 or knock - down of ta ##ce expression by sir ##na . these data suggest that cellular signals triggered by the interaction of sar ##s - co ##v with ace ##2 are positively involved in viral entry but lead to tissue damage . these findings may lead to the development of anti - sar ##s - co ##v agents .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel and highly infectious virus named sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . among the ser ##ological tests currently available for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v , a whole - virus - based im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) was considered one of the most sensitive ass ##ays and served as a “ gold standard ” during the sar ##s epidemic in singapore in 2003 . however , the need to manipulate live sar ##s - co ##v in the traditional if ##a limits its wide application due to the requirement for a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 3 laboratory and the risk of laboratory infection . previously , we have identified two im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes , named n ##19 ##5 and sc , in the two major structural proteins , the n and s proteins , of sar ##s - co ##v ( q . he , k . h . chong , h . h . ch ##ng , b . leung , a . e . ling , t . wei , s . w . chan , e . e . o ##oi , and j . kwan ##g , cl ##in . dia ##gn . lab . im ##mun ##ol . , 11 : 417 - 422 , 2004 ; l . lu , i . man ##op ##o , b . p . leung , h . h . ch ##ng , a . e . ling , l . l . che ##e , e . e . o ##oi , s . w . chan , and j . kwan ##g , j . cl ##in . micro ##bio ##l . 42 : 1570 - 157 ##6 , 2004 ) . in the present study , the n ##19 ##5 - sc fusion protein was highly expressed in insect ( sf ##9 ) cells infected with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus bearing the hybrid gene under the control of a poly ##hed ##rin promoter . an if ##a based on sf ##9 cells producing the fusion protein was standardized with 23 serum samples from patients with sar ##s , 20 serum samples from patients with auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases , and 43 serum samples from healthy blood donors . the detection rates were comparable to those obtained with a commercial sar ##s - co ##v if ##a kit ( euro ##im ##mun , gross gr ##oe ##na ##u , germany ) and a conventional if ##a performed at the singapore general hospital . our data showed that the newly developed if ##a could detect sar ##s - co ##v in 22 of the 23 sar ##s - co ##v - positive serum samples and gave no false - positive results when the sera from patients with auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases and healthy individuals were tested . the
in 2012 middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was evolved in the arabian peninsula . tremendous and successful efforts have been conducted to discover the genome structure , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical signs , pathogen ##esis , diagnosis and anti ##vira ##l therapy . tap ##ho ##zo ##us per ##for ##atus bats are the inc ##rim ##inated reservoir host and camel ##s are the currently confirmed animal link ##er . the virus resulted in less than 1000 infected cases and 355 deaths . the case fatal ##ity rate of the mer ##s - co ##v is high , however , many survivors of mer ##s - co ##v infection showed ina ##ppa ##rent infections and , in several cases , multiple co - in ##fect ##ing agents did exist . although mer ##s - co ##v appears to be a dangerous disease , it is argued here that a full assessment of current knowledge about the disease does not suggest that it is a truly scary killer .  
objective : healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) are at high risk of contracting middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) during an epidemic . we explored the emotions , perceived stress ##ors , and coping strategies of healthcare workers who worked during a mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in our hospital . design : a cross - sectional descriptive survey design . setting : a tertiary care hospital . participants : hc ##ws ( 150 ) who worked in high risk areas during the april – may 2014 mer ##s - co ##v outbreak that occurred in jed ##dah , saudi arabia . methods : we developed and administered a “ mer ##s - co ##v staff question ##naire ” to study participants . the question ##naire consisted of 5 sections with 72 questions . the sections evaluated hospital staff ##s emotions , perceived stress ##ors , factors that reduced their stress , coping strategies , and mo ##tiv ##ators to work during future outbreak ##s . responses were scored on a scale from 0 – 3 . the varying levels of stress or effectiveness of measures were reported as mean and standard deviation , as appropriate . results : completed question ##naire ##s were returned by 117 ( 78 % ) of the participants . the results had many unique elements . hc ##ws ethical obligation to their profession pushed them to continue with their jobs . the main sentiments centered upon fear of personal safety and well - being of colleagues and family . positive attitudes in the workplace , clinical improvement of infected colleagues , and stop ##page of disease transmission among hc ##ws after adopting strict protective measures alleviate ##d their fear and drove them through the epidemic . they appreciated recognition of their efforts by hospital management and expected similar ac ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent , infection control guidance , and equipment would en ##tic ##e them to work during future epidemic ##s . conclusion : the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak was a distress ##ing time for our staff . hospitals can enhance hc ##ws experiences during any future mer ##s - co ##v outbreak by focusing on the above mentioned aspects .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , and infections with this virus can result in acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure . globally , mer ##s - co ##v has been responsible for 87 ##7 laboratory - confirmed infections , including 317 deaths , since september 2012 . as there is a pau ##city of information regarding the molecular pathogen ##esis associated with this virus or the identities of novel anti ##vira ##l drug targets , we performed temporal kin ##ome analysis on human he ##pa ##to ##cytes infected with the erasmus isolate of mer ##s - co ##v with peptide kin ##ome arrays . bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis of our kin ##ome data , including pathway over ##re ##pres ##entation analysis ( or ##a ) and functional network analysis , suggested that extra ##cellular signal - regulated kinase ( er ##k ) / mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) and ph ##os ##ph ##oin ##osi ##to ##l 3 - kinase ( pi ##3 ##k ) / ser ##ine - th ##re ##oni ##ne kinase ( ak ##t ) / mammalian target of rap ##amy ##cin ( mt ##or ) signaling responses were specifically mod ##ulated in response to mer ##s - co ##v infection in vitro throughout the course of infection . the over ##re ##pres ##entation of specific intermediate ##s within these pathways determined by pathway and functional network analysis of our kin ##ome data correlated with similar patterns of ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation determined through western b ##lot array analysis . in addition , analysis of the effects of specific kinase inhibitors on mer ##s - co ##v infection in tissue culture models confirmed these cellular response observations . further , we have demonstrated that a subset of licensed kinase inhibitors targeting the er ##k / map ##k and pi ##3 ##k / ak ##t / mt ##or pathways significantly inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v replication in vitro whether they were added before or after viral infection . taken together , our data suggest that er ##k / map ##k and pi ##3 ##k / ak ##t / mt ##or signaling responses play important roles in mer ##s - co ##v infection and may represent novel drug targets for therapeutic intervention strategies .  
based on a bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##v ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) s protein , we synthesized a panel of peptide ##s coupled to key ##hole limp ##et ha ##em ##oc ##yan ##in and used them to raise antibodies in rabbits . in addition , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) was used to raise poly ##cl ##onal antibodies in mice . all of the antibodies raised by s - peptide im ##mun ##isation were specific and sensitive for s protein expressed in trans ##fect ##ed cells in the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay or western b ##lot ##ting . the rb ##d efficiently eli ##cite ##d neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v by blocking viral entry at the binding step . furthermore , we found that the sp ##3 peptide , corresponding to amino - acid residues 73 ##6 – 76 ##1 of the s protein , eli ##cite ##d robust neutral ##izing activities by blocking viral entry at the post ##bin ##ding and membrane fusion steps . we conclude that amino - acid residues 73 ##6 – 76 ##1 of the s protein carry neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes that may be used in the development of vaccines and anti ##vira ##l agents against mer ##s - co ##v .  
it is believed that a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was passed from palm ci ##vet ##s to humans and caused the epidemic of sar ##s in 2002 to 2003 . the major species barriers between humans and ci ##vet ##s for sar ##s - co ##v infections are the specific interactions between a defined receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) on a viral spike protein and its host receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . in this study a chi ##meric ace ##2 bearing the critical n - terminal helix from ci ##vet and the remaining pep ##ti ##das ##e domain from human was constructed , and it was shown that this construct has the same receptor activity as ci ##vet ace ##2 . in addition , crystal structures of the chi ##meric ace ##2 complex ##ed with rb ##ds from various human and ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v strains were determined . these structures , combined with a previously determined structure of human ace ##2 complex ##ed with the rb ##d from a human sar ##s - co ##v strain , have revealed a structural basis for understanding the major species barriers between humans and ci ##vet ##s for sar ##s - co ##v infections . they show that the major species barriers are determined by interactions between four ace ##2 residues ( residues 31 , 35 , 38 , and 35 ##3 ) and two rb ##d residues ( residues 47 ##9 and 48 ##7 ) , that early ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s were prevented from in ##fect ##ing human cells due to im ##balance ##d salt bridges at the hydro ##phobic virus / receptor interface , and that sar ##s - co ##v has evolved to gain sustained in ##fect ##ivity for human cells by eliminating un ##fa ##vor ##able free charges at the interface through step ##wise mutations at positions 47 ##9 and 48 ##7 . these results enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross - species infections of sar ##s - co ##v and other emerging animal viruses .  
the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities and specific ##ities of an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay and an enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y for detection of antibodies specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were compared for 148 laboratory - confirmed sar ##s cases . the appearance and persistence of sar ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies were assessed , with im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g detected in 59 % of samples collected within 14 days and persist ##ing for 60 to 95 days after the onset of illness .  
the type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and hat can cl ##ea ##ve and activate the spike protein ( s ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) for membrane fusion . in addition , these pro ##tea ##ses cl ##ea ##ve the viral receptor , the car ##box ##ype ##pt ##ida ##se ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , and it was proposed that ace ##2 cleavage aug ##ments viral in ##fect ##ivity . however , no me ##chan ##istic insights into this process were obtained and the relevance of ace ##2 cleavage for sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( sar ##s - s ) activation has not been determined . here , we show that ar ##gin ##ine and l ##ys ##ine residues within ace ##2 amino acids 69 ##7 to 71 ##6 are essential for cleavage by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and hat and that ace ##2 processing is required for aug ##ment ##ation of sar ##s - s - driven entry by these pro ##tea ##ses . in contrast , ace ##2 cleavage was di ##sp ##ens ##able for activation of the viral s protein . expression of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 increased cellular up ##take of soluble sar ##s - s , suggesting that pro ##tea ##se - dependent aug ##ment ##ation of viral entry might be due to increased up ##take of vi ##rion ##s into target cells . finally , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 was found to compete with the metal ##lo ##pro ##tea ##se adam ##17 for ace ##2 processing , but only cleavage by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 resulted in augmented sar ##s - s - driven entry . collectively , our results in conjunction with those of previous studies indicate that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and potentially related pro ##tea ##ses promote sar ##s - co ##v entry by two separate mechanisms : ace ##2 cleavage , which might promote viral up ##take , and sar ##s - s cleavage , which activate ##s the s protein for membrane fusion . these observations have interesting implications for the development of novel therapeutic ##s . in addition , they should spur efforts to determine whether receptor cleavage promotes entry of other corona ##virus ##es , which use pep ##ti ##das ##es as entry receptors .  
prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to combat infections caused by the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . here , we have developed a neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) , designated mer ##sma ##b ##1 , which potent ##ly blocks mer ##s - co ##v entry into human cells . bio ##chemical ass ##ays reveal that mer ##sma ##b ##1 specifically binds to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and thereby competitive ##ly blocks the binding of the rb ##d to its cellular receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . furthermore , alan ##ine scanning of the rb ##d has identified several residues at the d ##pp ##4 - binding surface that serve as neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes for mer ##sma ##b ##1 . these results suggest that if human ##ized , mer ##sma ##b ##1 could potentially function as a therapeutic antibody for treating and preventing mer ##s - co ##v infections . additionally , mer ##sma ##b ##1 may facilitate studies of the conform ##ation and antigen ##ici ##ty of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d and thus will guide rational design of mer ##s - co ##v subunit vaccines . importance mer ##s - co ##v is spreading in the human population and causing severe respiratory diseases with over 40 % fatal ##ity . no vaccine is currently available to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infections . here , we have produced a neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody with the capacity to effectively block mer ##s - co ##v entry into per ##missive human cells . if human ##ized , this antibody may be used as a prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic agent against mer ##s - co ##v infections . specifically , when given to a person ( e . g . , a patient ' s family member or a health care worker ) either before or after exposure to mer ##s - co ##v , the human ##ized antibody may prevent or inhibit mer ##s - co ##v infection , thereby stopping the spread of mer ##s - co ##v in humans . this antibody can also serve as a useful tool to guide the design of effective mer ##s - co ##v vaccines .  
replication of the gen ##omic rna of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is mediated by replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s that are processed by two viral pro ##tea ##ses , papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) and 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) . previously , we showed that sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro processes the replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein at three conserved cleavage sites . here , we report the identification and characterization of a 316 - amino - acid catalytic core domain of pl ##pro that can efficiently cl ##ea ##ve replica ##se substrates in trans - cleavage ass ##ays and peptide substrates in fluorescent resonance energy transfer - based pro ##tea ##se ass ##ays . we performed bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis on 16 papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se domains from nine different corona ##virus ##es and identified a put ##ative catalytic triad ( cy ##s ##16 ##51 - his ##18 ##12 - as ##p ##18 ##26 ) and zinc - binding site . mu ##tage ##nes ##is studies revealed that as ##p ##18 ##26 and the four cy ##stein ##e residues involved in zinc binding are essential for sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro activity . molecular modeling of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro suggested that this catalytic core may also have de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activity . we tested this hypothesis by measuring the de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating activity of pl ##pro by two independent ass ##ays . sar ##s co ##v - pl ##pro hydro ##ly ##zed both di ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in and u ##bi ##qui ##tin - 7 - amino - 4 - methyl ##co ##uma ##rin ( amc ) substrates , and hydro ##lysis of u ##bi ##qui ##tin - amc is approximately 180 - fold more efficient than hydro ##lysis of a peptide substrate that mimic ##s the pl ##pro replica ##se recognition sequence . to investigate the critical deter ##mina ##nts recognized by pl ##pro , we performed site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is on the p ##6 to p ##2 ′ residues at each of the three pl ##pro cleavage sites . we found that pl ##pro recognizes the consensus cleavage sequence l ##x ##gg , which is also the consensus sequence recognized by cellular de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzymes . this similarity in the substrate recognition sites should be considered during the development of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro inhibitors .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) can cause highly prevalent diseases in humans and animals . fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ( fi ##p ##v ) belongs to the genus alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus , resulting in a lethal systemic gran ##ulo ##mat ##ous disease called fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis ( fi ##p ) , which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases of cats worldwide . no specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat fi ##p . co ##v main pro ##tea ##ses ( m ( pro ) s ) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and replication , making them an ideal target for drug development . here , we report the crystal structure of fi ##p ##v m ( pro ) in complex with dual inhibitors , a zinc ion and a michael accept ##or . the complex structure elaborate ##s a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors syn ##er ##gizing to ina ##ct ##ivate the pro ##tea ##se , providing a structural basis to design novel anti ##vira ##ls and suggesting the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against co ##v - associated diseases . importance corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have the largest genome size among all rna viruses . co ##v infection causes various diseases in humans and animals , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . no approved specific drugs or va ##cci ##nation ##s are available to treat their infections . here , we report a novel dual inhibition mechanism targeting co ##v main pro ##tea ##se ( m ( pro ) ) from fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ( fi ##p ##v ) , which leads to lethal systemic gran ##ulo ##mat ##ous disease in cats . m ( pro ) , conserved across all co ##v genome ##s , is essential for viral replication and transcription . we demonstrated that zinc ion and a michael accept ##or - based pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitor syn ##er ##gist ##ically ina ##ct ##ivate fi ##p ##v m ( pro ) . we also solved the structure of fi ##p ##v m ( pro ) complex ##ed with two inhibitors , del ##ine ##ating the structural view of a dual inhibition mechanism . our study provides new insight into the pharmaceutical strategy against co ##v m ( pro ) through using zinc as an ad ##ju ##vant therapy to enhance the efficacy of an ir ##re ##vers ##ible pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitor .  
acute lung injury ( ali ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , caused by influenza a virus h ##5 ##n ##1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , supposedly depend on activation of the ox ##ida ##tive - stress machinery that is coupled with innate immunity , resulting in a strong pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory host response . inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines , such as inter ##le ##uki ##n 1 ##β ( il - 1 ##β ) , il - 8 , and il - 6 , play a major role in media ##ting and amp ##li ##fying ali / ar ##ds by stimulating che ##mot ##ax ##is and activation of ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s . to obtain further insight into the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - associated ali , we compared sar ##s - co ##v infections in two different non ##hum ##an primate species , cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues and african green monkeys . viral ti ##ters in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in sar ##s - co ##v - infected mac ##aq ##ues and african green monkeys . inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines that play a major role in media ##ting and amp ##li ##fying ali / ar ##ds or have ne ##ut ##rop ##hil che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t activity , such as il - 6 , il - 8 , c ##x ##cl ##1 , and c ##x ##cl ##2 , were , however , induced only in mac ##aq ##ues . in contrast , other pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and che ##mo ##kin ##es , including os ##te ##op ##ont ##in and cc ##l ##3 , were up ##re ##gul ##ated in the lungs of african green monkeys to a significantly greater extent than in mac ##aq ##ues . because african green monkeys developed more severe ali than mac ##aq ##ues , with h ##yal ##ine membrane formation , some of these differential ##ly expressed pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory genes may be critically involved in development of the observed path ##ological changes . induction of distinct pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory genes after sar ##s - co ##v infection in different non ##hum ##an primate species needs to be taken into account when analyzing outcomes of intervention strategies in these species .  
stress gran ##ule ( sg ) formation is generally triggered as a result of stress - induced translation arrest . the impact of sg formation on virus replication varies among different viruses , and the significance of sg ##s in corona ##virus ( co ##v ) replication is largely unknown . the present study examined the biological role of sg ##s in middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v replication . the mer ##s - co ##v 4a accessory protein is known to inhibit sg formation in cells in which it was expressed by binding to double - stranded rna ##s and inhibit ##ing protein kinase r ( p ##kr ) - mediated ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of the α subunit of eu ##kar ##yo ##tic initiation factor 2 ( e ##if ##2 ##α ) . replication of mer ##s - co ##v lacking the genes for 4a and 4 ##b ( mer ##s - co ##v - δ ##p ##4 ) , but not mer ##s - co ##v , induced sg accumulation in mer ##s - co ##v - susceptible he ##la / cd ##26 cells , while replication of both viruses failed to induce sg ##s in ve ##ro cells , demonstrating cell type - specific differences in mer ##s - co ##v - δ ##p ##4 - induced sg formation . mer ##s - co ##v - δ ##p ##4 replicate ##d less efficiently than mer ##s - co ##v in he ##la / cd ##26 cells , and inhibition of sg formation by small interfering rna - mediated de ##ple ##tion of the sg components promoted mer ##s - co ##v - δ ##p ##4 replication , demonstrating that sg formation was detrimental for mer ##s - co ##v replication . in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt mer ##s - co ##v - δ ##p ##4 replication was not due to either the induction of type i and type iii inter ##fer ##ons or the accumulation of viral mrna ##s in the sg ##s . rather , it was due to the in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt translation of viral proteins , which was caused by high levels of p ##kr - mediated e ##if ##2 ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and likely by the confinement of various factors that are required for translation in the sg ##s . finally , we established that del ##eti ##on of the 4a gene alone was sufficient for inducing sg ##s in infected cells . our study revealed that 4a - mediated inhibition of sg formation facilitates viral translation , leading to efficient mer ##s - co ##v replication . importance middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes respiratory failure with a high case fatal ##ity rate in patients , yet effective anti ##vira ##ls and vaccines are currently not available . stress gran ##ule ( sg ) formation is one of the cellular stress responses to virus infection and is generally triggered as a result of
enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fu ##sing with cellular membranes , a step that is required for virus replication . corona ##virus ##es , including the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) , fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor - mediated end ##oc ##yt ##osis and fuse with end ##oso ##mes , depending on the cell or tissue type . the virus spike ( s ) protein media ##tes fusion with the host cell membrane . we have shown previously that an abel ##son ( ab ##l ) kinase inhibitor , im ##atin ##ib , significantly reduces sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v viral ti ##tres and prevents end ##osomal entry by hiv sar ##s s and mer ##s s pseudo ##type ##d vi ##rion ##s . sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v are classified as bs ##l - 3 viruses , which makes experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging . here , we use ib ##v , a bs ##l - 2 virus , as a model for studying the role of ab ##l kinase activity during corona ##virus infection . we found that im ##atin ##ib and two specific ab ##l kinase inhibitors , g ##n ##f ##2 and g ##n ##f ##5 , reduce ib ##v ti ##tres by blocking the first round of virus infection . additionally , all three drugs prevented ib ##v s - induced sync ##yt ##ia formation prior to the hem ##if ##usion step . our results indicate that membrane fusion ( both virus – cell and cell – cell ) is blocked in the presence of ab ##l kinase inhibitors . studying the effects of ab ##l kinase inhibitors on ib ##v will be useful in identifying the host cell pathways required for corona ##virus infection . this will provide an insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging corona ##virus ##es .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious disease which was caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) . sar ##s has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004 , with 80 ##9 ##8 individuals being infected and a death toll of 77 ##4 in 28 regions around the world . specific humor ##al responses to viral infection remain unclear . objective : to anal ##yse the antigen ##ici ##ty of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v genome and identify potential antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes in the structural proteins . methods : potential antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes were identified in the structural proteins ( nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , membrane , spike , and small envelope proteins ) and hypothetical proteins ( sar ##s ##3 ##a , 3 ##b , 6 , 7 ##a , and 9 ##b ) that are specific for sar ##s ‐ co ##v . a peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these ep ##ito ##pes were investigated in 59 different sar ##s patients ' sera obtained 6 – 103 days after the onset of the illness . serial sera from five additional patients were also studied . results : ep ##ito ##pes at the n ‐ terminus of the membrane protein and the c ‐ terminus of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein eli ##cite ##d strong antibody responses . ep ##ito ##pes on the spike protein were only moderately im ##mun ##ogenic but the effects were persistent . antibodies were also detected for some put ##ative proteins , noticeably the c ‐ term ##ini of sar ##s ##3 ##a and sar ##s ##6 . conclusions : important ep ##ito ##pes of the sar ##s ‐ co ##v genome that may serve as potential markers for the viral infection are identified . these specific antigen ##ic sites may also be important for vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease .  
accurate and timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection is a critical step in preventing another global outbreak . in this study , 82 ##9 serum specimens were collected from 64 ##3 patients initially reported to be infected with sar ##s - co ##v . the sera were tested for the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v by using an antigen capture enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) based on mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non - sar ##s feb ##ril ##e patients . the results of the n protein detection analysis were directly related to the ser ##ological analysis data . from 27 sar ##s patients who tested positive with the neutral ##ization test , 100 % of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the n protein . n protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group . the positive rates of n protein for sera collected at 1 to 5 , 6 to 10 , 11 to 15 , and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 41 ##4 samples from 298 ser ##ological ##ly confirmed patients were 92 . 9 , 69 . 8 , 36 . 4 , and 21 . 1 % , respectively . for 294 sera from 248 ser ##ological test - negative patients , the rates were 25 . 6 , 16 . 7 , 9 . 3 , and 0 % , respectively . the n protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be sar ##s but ser ##ological ##ly proven to be negative for sar ##s and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non - sar ##s feb ##ril ##e patients . the specific ##ity of the ass ##ay was 100 % . furthermore , of 16 sera collected from four patients during the sar ##s rec ##ur ##rence in guangzhou , 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the n protein . n protein detection exhibited a high positive rate , 96 to 100 % , between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutral ##ization test - positive sar ##s patients and 298 ser ##ological ##ly confirmed patients . the n protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10 , and n protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms . in conclusion , an antigen capture elisa reveals a high n protein detection rate in acute - phase sera of patients with sar ##s , which makes it useful for early diagnosis of sar ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently emerged human disease associated with pneumonia . ina ##ppa ##rent infection with sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is not well characterized . to develop a safe , simple , and reliable screening method for sar ##s diagnosis and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological study , two rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins ( n ′ protein and n ##δ ( 121 ) protein ) were expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli , pu ##rified by affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy , and used as antigen ##s for indirect , im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ) . serum samples collected from healthy volunteers and sar ##s patients in vietnam were used to evaluate the newly developed methods . the n ′ protein - based elisa showed a highly non ##sp ##ec ##ific reaction . the n ##δ ( 121 ) protein - based elisa , with a non ##sp ##ec ##ific reaction drastically reduced compared to that of the nearly - whole - length n ′ protein - based elisa , resulted in higher rates of positive reactions , higher ti ##ters , and earlier detection than the sar ##s - co ##v - infected cell l ##ys ##ate - based elisa . these results indicate that our newly developed sar ##s - co ##v n ##δ ( 121 ) protein - based elisa is not only safe but also a more specific and more sensitive method to dia ##gno ##se sar ##s - co ##v infection and hence a useful tool for large - scale ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies . to identify ina ##ppa ##rent sar ##s - co ##v infections , serum samples collected from health care workers ( hc ##ws ) in vietnam were screened by the n ##δ ( 121 ) protein - based elisa , and positive samples were confirmed by a virus neutral ##ization test . four out of 149 hc ##ws were identified to have ina ##ppa ##rent sar ##s - co ##v infection in vietnam , indicating that sub ##cl ##ini ##cal sar ##s - co ##v infection in vietnam is rare but does exist .  
the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 and , more recently , middle eastern respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) under ##sco ##res the importance of understanding critical aspects of co ##v infection and pathogen ##esis . despite significant insights into co ##v cross - species transmission , replication , and virus - host interactions , successful therapeutic options for co ##vs do not yet exist . recent identification of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##16 as a viral 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase ) led to the possibility of utilizing this pathway to both at ##ten ##uate sar ##s - co ##v infection and develop novel therapeutic treatment options . mutations were introduced into sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##16 within the conserved k ##d ##ke motif and effectively at ##ten ##uated the resulting sar ##s - co ##v mutant viruses both in vitro and in vivo . while viruses lacking 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase activity had enhanced sensitivity to type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , they were not completely restored in their absence in vivo . however , the absence of either md ##a ##5 or if ##it ##1 , if ##n - responsive genes that recognize un ##met ##hyl ##ated 2 ′ - o rna , resulted in restored replication and vi ##ru ##lence of the d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant virus . finally , using the mutant as a live - at ##ten ##uated vaccine showed significant promise for possible therapeutic development against sar ##s - co ##v . together , the data under ##sco ##re the necessity of 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase activity for sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and identify host immune pathways that media ##te this at ##ten ##uation . in addition , we describe novel treatment avenues that exploit this pathway and could potentially be used against a diverse range of viral pathogen ##s that utilize 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase activity to sub ##vert the immune system . importance preventing recognition by the host immune response represents a critical aspect necessary for successful viral infection . several viruses , including sar ##s - co ##v , utilize viral ##ly encoded 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase ##s to camouflage and obscure their viral rna from host cell sensing machinery , thus preventing recognition and activation of cell intrinsic defense pathways . for sar ##s - co ##v , the absence of this 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase activity results in significant at ##ten ##uation characterized by decreased viral replication , reduced weight loss , and limited breathing dysfunction in mice . the results indicate that both md ##a ##5 , a recognition molecule , and the if ##it family play an important role in media ##ting this at ##ten ##uation with
r ##hes ##us and cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues were challenged with 10 ( 7 ) p ##fu of a clinical isolate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus . some of the animals developed a mild self - limited respiratory infection very different from that observed in humans with sar ##s . the mac ##aq ##ue model as it currently exists will have limited utility in the study of sar ##s and the evaluation of the ##ra ##pies .  
middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) spreads to humans via zoo ##not ##ic transmission from camel ##s . mer ##s - co ##v belongs to lineage c of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es ( beta ##co ##vs ) , which also includes viruses isolated from bats and hedge ##hog ##s . a large portion of the beta ##co ##v genome consists of two open reading frames ( or ##f ##1 ##a and or ##f ##1 ##b ) that are translated into poly ##pro ##tein ##s . these are cl ##ea ##ved by viral pro ##tea ##ses to generate 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##p ##1 to ns ##p ##16 ) which compose the viral replication - transcription complex . we investigated the evolution of or ##f ##1 ##a and or ##f ##1 ##b in lineage c beta ##co ##vs . results indicated widespread positive selection , acting mostly on or ##f ##1 ##a . the proportion of positively selected sites in or ##f ##1 ##a was much higher than that previously reported for the surface - exposed spike protein . selected sites were uneven ##ly distributed , with ns ##p ##3 representing the prefer ##ential target . several pairs of coe ##vo ##lving sites were also detected , possibly indicating ep ##ista ##tic interactions ; most of these were located in ns ##p ##3 . adaptive evolution at ns ##p ##3 is ongoing in mer ##s - co ##v strains , and two selected sites ( g ##7 ##20 and r ##9 ##11 ) were detected in the pro ##tea ##se domain . while position 720 is variable in camel - derived viruses , suggesting that the selective event does not represent a specific adaptation to humans , the r ##9 ##11 ##c substitution was observed only in human - derived mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , including the viral strain responsible for the recent south korean outbreak . it will be extremely important to assess whether these changes affect host range or other viral ph ##eno ##type ##s . more generally , data here ##in indicate that co ##v ns ##p ##3 represents a major selection target and that ns ##p ##3 sequencing should be en ##vis ##aged in monitoring programs and field surveys . importance both severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and mer ##s - co ##v originated in bats and spread to humans via an intermediate host . this clearly highlights the potential for corona ##virus host shifting and the relevance of understanding the molecular events underlying the adaptation to new host species . we investigated the evolution of or ##f ##1 ##a and or ##f ##1 ##b in lineage c beta ##co ##vs and in 87 sequence ##d mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s . results indicated widespread positive selection , stronger in or ##f ##1 ##a than in or ##f ##1 ##b . several selected sites were found to be located in
to identify a major antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt for use in the development of a rapid ser ##ological diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus infection and to study the immune response during sar ##s corona ##virus infection in humans , we clone ##d the full length and six truncated fragments of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene , expressed them , and pu ##rified them as g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase - tagged rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins . the react ##iv ##ities of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins to a panel of antibodies containing 33 sar ##s corona ##virus - positive sera and 66 negative sera and to antibodies against other animal corona ##virus ##es were screened . a truncated 195 - amino - acid fragment from the c terminus of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ##19 ##5 ) was identified that had a strong ability to detect antibodies against sar ##s corona ##virus . no cross - reaction was found between the n ##19 ##5 protein and antibodies against chicken , pig , and canine corona ##virus ##es . the n ##19 ##5 protein was used to develop a western b ##lot ass ##ay to detect antibodies against sar ##s corona ##virus in 274 clinical ##ly blinded samples . the specific ##ity and sensitivity of this test were 98 . 3 and 90 . 9 % , respectively . the correlation between our western b ##lot ##ting ass ##ay and an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) was also analyzed . the results of our western b ##lot ass ##ay and if ##a for the detection of sar ##s corona ##virus - positive sera were the same . thus , the n ##19 ##5 protein was identified as a suitable protein to be used as an antigen in western b ##lot and other possible ass ##ays for the detection of sar ##s corona ##virus infection .  
the discovery of a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has highlighted the need for a better understanding of co ##v replication . the replication of sar ##s - co ##v is highly dependent on host cell factors . however , relatively little is known about the cellular pro ##te ##ome changes that occur during sar ##s - co ##v replication . recently , we developed a cell line expressing a sar ##s - co ##v sub ##gen ##omic rep ##lic ##on and used it to screen inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v replication . to identify host proteins important for sar ##s - co ##v rna replication , the protein profiles of the sar ##s - co ##v rep ##lic ##on cells and parental b ##h ##k ##21 cells were compared using a quantitative pro ##te ##omic strategy termed “ stable - isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture - mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ” ( si ##la ##c - ms ) . our results revealed that , among the 1 , 08 ##1 host proteins quan ##ti ##fied in both forward and reverse si ##la ##c measurements , 74 had significantly altered levels of expression . of these , significantly up ##re ##gul ##ated bc ##l ##2 - associated at ##han ##ogen ##e 3 ( bag ##3 ) was selected for further functional studies . bag ##3 is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes , including cell survival , cellular stress response , proliferation , migration , and ap ##op ##tosis . our results show that inhibition of bag ##3 expression by rna interference led to significant suppression of sar ##s - co ##v replication , suggesting the possibility that up ##re ##gul ##ation of bag ##3 may be part of the machinery that sar ##s - co ##v relies on for replication . by co ##rre ##lating the pro ##te ##omic data with these functional studies , the findings of this study provide important information for understanding sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s , an emerging disease characterized by at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . using a yeast two - hybrid screen with the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v as a bait , the c terminus ( amino acids 251 to 422 ) of the n protein was found to interact with human el ##onga ##tion factor 1 - alpha ( e ##f ##1 ##α ) , an essential component of the translation ##al machinery with an important role in cy ##tok ##ines ##is , promoting the bun ##dling of fi ##lam ##ent ##ous act ##in ( f - act ##in ) . in vitro and in vivo interaction was then confirmed by im ##mun ##o - cop ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation , far - western b ##lot ##ting , and surface pl ##as ##mon resonance . it was demonstrated that the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s aggregation of e ##f ##1 ##α , inhibit ##ing protein translation and cy ##tok ##ines ##is by blocking f - act ##in bun ##dling . proliferation of human peripheral blood l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and other human cell lines was significantly inhibit ##ed by the infection of rec ##om ##bina ##nt retro ##virus expressing sar ##s - co ##v n protein .  
a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , has recently been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . sar ##s - co ##v appears similar to other corona ##virus ##es in both vi ##rion structure and genome organization . it is known for other corona ##virus ##es that the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is required for both viral attachment to per ##missive cells and for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane . here we describe the construction and expression of a soluble cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein comprising the first 1 , 190 amino acids of the native s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ( 119 ##0 ) ) . the cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed and native s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s exhibit similar molecular weight as determined by western b ##lot analysis , indicating that synthetic s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is modified correctly in a mammalian expression system . s ( 119 ##0 ) binds to the surface of ve ##ro e ##6 cells , a cell per ##missive to infection , as demonstrated by flu ##orescence - activated cell sort ##er analysis , suggesting that s ( 119 ##0 ) maintains the bio ##logic activity present in native s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . this interaction is blocked with serum obtained from recovering sar ##s patients , indicating that the binding is specific . in an effort to map the ligand - binding domain of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , car ##box ##y - and amino - terminal tr ##un ##cation ##s of the s ( 119 ##0 ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein were constructed . amino acids 270 to 510 were the minimal receptor - binding region of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein as determined by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry . we spec ##ulate that amino acids 1 to 510 of the sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein represent a unique domain containing the receptor - binding site ( amino acids 270 to 510 ) , analogous to the s ##1 subunit of other corona ##virus s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s .  
low micro ##mo ##lar , non - cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c concentrations of cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a ( csa ) strongly affected the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , human corona ##virus 229 ##e and mouse hepatitis virus in cell culture , as was evident from the strong inhibition of g ##fp reporter gene expression and a reduction of up to 4 logs in pro ##geny ti ##tres . upon high - multi ##plicity infection , csa treatment rendered sar ##s - co ##v rna and protein synthesis almost und ##ete ##ctable , suggesting an early block in replication . sir ##na - mediated knock ##down of the expression of the prominent csa targets cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a and b did not affect sar ##s - co ##v replication , suggesting either that these specific cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in family members are di ##sp ##ens ##able or that the reduced expression levels su ##ffi ##ce to support replication .  
the ability of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) to in ##fect small animal species may be restricted given the fact that mice , fe ##rret ##s , and ham ##sters were shown to resist mer ##s - co ##v infection . we in ##oc ##ulated rabbits with mer ##s - co ##v . although virus was detected in the lungs , neither significant his ##top ##ath ##ological changes nor clinical symptoms were observed . infectious virus , however , was ex ##cre ##ted from the upper respiratory tract , indicating a potential route of mer ##s - co ##v transmission in some animal species .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a newly emerged corona ##virus ( co ##v ) designated sar ##s - co ##v . the virus utilizes ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as the primary receptor . although the idea is less clear and somewhat controversial , sar ##s - co ##v is thought to use c - type le ##ct ##ins dc - sign and / or l - sign ( collectively referred to as dc / l - sign ) as alternative receptors or as enhance ##r factors that facilitate ace ##2 - mediated virus infection . in this study , the function of dc / l - sign in sar ##s - co ##v infection was examined in detail . the results of our study clearly demonstrate that both proteins serve as receptors independently of ace ##2 and that there is a minimal level of syn ##ergy between dc / l - sign and ace ##2 . as expected , g ##ly ##cans on spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein are important for dc / l - sign - mediated virus infection . site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is analyses have identified seven g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites on the s protein critical for dc / l - sign - mediated virus entry . they include as ##para ##gin ##e residues at amino acid positions 109 , 118 , 119 , 158 , 227 , 58 ##9 , and 69 ##9 , which are distinct from residues of the ace ##2 - binding domain ( amino acids 318 to 510 ) . amino acid sequence analyses of s proteins encoded by viruses isolated from animals and humans suggest that g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites n ##22 ##7 and n ##6 ##9 ##9 have facilitated zoo ##not ##ic transmission .  
of 30 cell lines and primary cells examined , productive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( urban ##i strain ) ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection after low - multi ##plicity in ##oc ##ulation was detected in only six : three african green monkey kidney ep ##ith ##elial cell lines ( ve ##ro , ve ##ro e ##6 , and ma ##10 ##4 ) , a human colon ep ##ith ##elial line ( ca ##co - 2 ) , a por ##cine kidney ep ##ith ##elial line [ p ##k ( 15 ) ] , and min ##k lung ep ##ith ##elial cells ( mv 1 lu ) . sar ##s - co ##v produced a l ##ytic infection in ve ##ro , ve ##ro e ##6 , and ma ##10 ##4 cells , but there was no visible cy ##top ##athic effect in ca ##co - 2 , mv 1 lu , or p ##k ( 15 ) cells . multi ##ste ##p growth kinetic ##s were identical in ve ##ro e ##6 and ma ##10 ##4 cells , with maximum ti ##ter reached 24 h post ##ino ##cula ##tion ( hp ##i ) . virus ti ##ter was maximal 96 hp ##i in ca ##co - 2 cells , and virus was continually produced from infected ca ##co - 2 cells for at least 6 weeks after infection . ca ##co - 2 was the only human cell type of 13 tested that supported efficient sar ##s - co ##v replication . expression of the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , resulted in sar ##s - co ##v replication in all ref ##rac ##tory cell lines examined . ti ##ters achieved were variable and dependent upon the method of ace ##2 expression .  
introduction : six years have passed since middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a newly emerging infectious virus , was first reported in 2012 . although mer ##s - co ##v has had a consistently high mortality rate in humans , no vaccines have been approved to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans . mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is a key target for development of mer ##s vaccines . areas covered : in this review , we illustrate the structure and function of s protein as a vaccine target , describe available animal models for evaluating mer ##s vaccines , and sum ##mar ##ize recent progress on mer ##s - co ##v s - based vaccines , focusing on their ability to eli ##cit antibody and / or cellular immune responses , neutral ##izing antibodies , and protection against mer ##s - co ##v infection in different models . prospects for future mer ##s - co ##v s - based vaccines are discussed . expert commentary : the majority of mer ##s vaccines under development are based on mer ##s - co ##v s protein , including full - length s , s ##1 , and receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . while it is essential to evaluate the safety of full - length s and s ##1 - based mer ##s vaccines , further improvement of the efficacy of rb ##d - based vaccines using novel strategies would be necessary . overall , this review provides inform ##ative guidance for designing and developing safe and effective mer ##s vaccines based on viral s protein .  
characterized animal models are needed for studying the pathogen ##esis of and evaluating medical counter ##me ##as ##ures for persist ##ing middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections . here , we further characterized a lethal trans ##genic mouse model of mer ##s - co ##v infection and disease that globally expresses human cd ##26 ( hc ##d ##26 ) / d ##pp ##4 . the 50 % infectious dose ( id ( 50 ) ) and lethal dose ( ld ( 50 ) ) of virus were estimated to be < 1 and 10 tc ##id ( 50 ) of mer ##s - co ##v , respectively . neutral ##izing antibody developed in the surviving mice from the id ( 50 ) / ld ( 50 ) determination ##s , and all were fully immune to challenge with 100 ld ( 50 ) of mer ##s - co ##v . the tissue distribution and his ##top ##ath ##ology in mice challenged with a potential working dose of 10 ld ( 50 ) of mer ##s - co ##v were subsequently evaluated . in contrast to the overwhelming infection seen in the mice challenged with 10 ( 5 ) ld ( 50 ) of mer ##s - co ##v , we were able to recover infectious virus from these mice only in ##fr ##e ##quent ##ly , although quantitative reverse transcription - pc ##r ( q ##rt - pc ##r ) tests indicated early and persistent lung infection and delayed occurrence of brain infection . persistent inflammatory infiltrate ##s were seen in the lungs and brain stems at day 2 and day 6 after infection , respectively . while focal infiltrate ##s were also noted in the liver , definite pathology was not seen in other tissues . finally , using a receptor binding domain protein vaccine and a mer ##s - co ##v fusion inhibitor , we demonstrated the value of this model for evaluating vaccines and anti ##vira ##ls against mer ##s . as outcomes of mer ##s - co ##v infection in patients differ greatly , ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to overwhelming disease and death , having available both an infection model and a lethal model makes this trans ##genic mouse model relevant for advancing mer ##s research . importance fully characterized animal models are essential for studying pathogen ##esis and for pre ##cl ##ini ##cal screening of vaccines and drugs against mer ##s - co ##v infection and disease . when given a high dose of mer ##s - co ##v , our trans ##genic mice expressing hc ##d ##26 / d ##pp ##4 viral receptor uniformly succumbed to death within 6 days , making it difficult to evaluate host responses to infection and disease . we further characterized this model by determining both the id ( 50 ) and the ld ( 50 ) of mer ##s - co ##v in order to establish both an infection model and a lethal model for mer ##s
nasal administration has emerged as a promising and attractive route for va ##cci ##nation , especially for the prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of respiratory diseases . our previous studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) can be assembled using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus ( rb ##v ) expression system and such v ##lp ##s induce specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses in mice after sub ##cut ##aneous injection . here , we investigated mu ##cos ##al immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s in a mouse model . mice were im ##mun ##ized in parallel , intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly or intra ##nas ##ally , with v ##lp ##s alone or with v ##lp ##s plus cy ##tos ##ine – phosphate – gu ##ano ##sin ##e ( cp ##g ) . immune responses , including the production of sar ##s - co ##v - specific serum im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) and secret ##ory im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin a ( si ##ga ) , were determined in mu ##cos ##al secret ##ions and tissues . both im ##mun ##izations induced sar ##s - co ##v - specific i ##gg , although the levels of i ##gg in groups im ##mun ##ized via the intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l ( i . p . ) route were higher . si ##ga was detected in saliva in groups im ##mun ##ized intra ##nas ##ally but not in groups im ##mun ##ized intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly . cp ##g had an ad ##ju ##vant effect on i ##ga production in gen ##ital tract wash ##es when administered intra ##nas ##ally but only affected i ##ga production in fae ##ces samples when administered intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly . in addition , i ##ga was also detected in mu ##cos ##al tissues from the lung and int ##est ##ine , while cp ##g induced an increased level of i ##ga in the int ##est ##ine . most importantly , neutral ##ization antibodies were detected in sera after i . p . and intra ##nas ##al ( i . n . ) im ##mun ##izations . secret ##ions in gen ##ital tract wash ##es from the i . n . group also showed neutral ##ization activity . furthermore , v ##lp ##s that were administered intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly eli ##cite ##d cellular immune responses as demonstrated by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##os ##pot ( eli ##sp ##ot ) ass ##ay analyses . in summary , our study indicates that mu ##cos ##al im ##mun ##ization with rb ##v sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s represent an effective means for eli ##cit ##ing protective systemic and mu ##cos ##al immune responses against sar ##s - co ##v , providing important information for vaccine design .  
specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus was detected in maternal blood , um ##bil ##ical blood , and am ##nio ##tic fluid from a pregnant sar ##s patient . potential protection of fe ##tus from infection was suggested .  
we describe here the design , synthesis , molecular modeling , and biological evaluation of a series of small molecule , non ##pe ##pt ##ide inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . our initial lead compound was identified via high - through ##put screening of a diverse chemical library . we subsequently carried out structure - activity relationship studies , and opt ##imi ##zed the lead structure to potent inhibitors that have shown anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . based upon the x - ray crystal structure of one of the potent inhibitors 24 - bound to sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , a drug - design template was created . our structure - based modification led to the design of a more potent inhibitor , 2 ( enzyme ic ( 50 ) = 0 . 46 μ ##m ; anti ##vira ##l ec ( 50 ) = 12 . 5 μ ##m ) . interesting ##ly , its methyl ##amine derivative 49 displayed good enzyme inhibitor ##y pot ##ency ( ic ( 50 ) = 1 . 3 μ ##m ) and most potent sar ##s anti ##vira ##l activity ( ec ( 50 ) = 2 . 5 μ ##m ) in the series . we have carried out computational docking studies and generated a predict ##ive 3d - q ##sar model for sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro inhibitors .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious disease , caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , for which there are no approved treatments . we report the discovery of a potent inhibitor of sar ##s - co ##v that blocks replication by inhibit ##ing the un ##wind ##ing activity of the sar ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se ( ns ##p ##13 ) . we used a forster resonance energy transfer ( fr ##et ) - based he ##lica ##se ass ##ay to screen the may ##bridge hit ##finder chemical library . we identified and valid ##ated a compound ( ss ##ya ##10 - 001 ) that specifically blocks the double - stranded rna ( ds ##rna ) and ds ##dna un ##wind ##ing activities of ns ##p ##13 , with 50 % inhibitor ##y concentrations ( ic ( 50 ) s ) of 5 . 70 and 5 . 30 μ ##m , respectively . this compound also has inhibitor ##y activity ( 50 % effective concentration [ ec ( 50 ) ] = 8 . 95 μ ##m ) in a sar ##s - co ##v rep ##lic ##on ass ##ay , with low cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city ( 50 % cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c concentration [ cc ( 50 ) ] = > 250 μ ##m ) , suggesting that the he ##lica ##se plays a still unidentified critical role in the sar ##s - co ##v life cycle . enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of ns ##p ##13 inhibition revealed that ss ##ya ##10 - 001 acts as a non ##com ##pet ##itive inhibitor of ns ##p ##13 with respect to nuclei ##c acid and atp substrates . moreover , ss ##ya ##10 - 001 does not affect atp hydro ##lysis or ns ##p ##13 binding to the nuclei ##c acid substrate . ss ##ya ##10 - 001 did not inhibit hepatitis c virus ( hc ##v ) he ##lica ##se , other bacterial and viral rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ##s , or reverse transcript ##ase . these results suggest that ss ##ya ##10 - 001 specifically blocks ns ##p ##13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nuclei ##c acids or atp . hence , it is possible that ss ##ya ##10 - 001 inhibit ##s un ##wind ##ing by ns ##p ##13 by affecting conform ##ation ##al changes during the course of the reaction or trans ##lo ##cation on the nuclei ##c acid . ss ##ya ##10 - 001 will be a valuable tool for studying the specific role of ns ##p ##13 in the sar ##s - co ##v life cycle , which could be a model for other ni ##do ##virus ##es and also a candidate for further development as a sar ##s anti ##vira ##l target .  
the four human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) are globally endemic respiratory pathogen ##s . the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is an emerging co ##v with a known zoo ##not ##ic source in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . little is known about the origins of endemic hc ##ov ##s . studying these viruses ’ evolutionary history could provide important insight into co ##v emergence . in tests of mer ##s - co ##v – infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies , we found viruses related to an hc ##ov , known as hc ##ov - 229 ##e , in 5 . 6 % of 1 , 03 ##3 animals . human - and dr ##ome ##dar ##y - derived viruses are each mono ##phy ##let ##ic , suggesting ecological isolation . one gene of dr ##ome ##dar ##y viruses exists in two versions in camel ##s , full length and deleted , whereas only the deleted version exists in humans . the del ##eti ##on increased in size over a succession starting from camel ##id viruses via old human viruses to contemporary human viruses . live isolate ##s of dr ##ome ##dar ##y 229 ##e viruses were obtained and studied to assess human infection risks . the viruses used the human entry receptor amino ##pe ##pt ##ida ##se n and replicate ##d in human he ##pa ##tom ##a cells , suggesting a principal ability to cause human infections . however , in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt replication in several mu ##cos ##a - derived cell lines and air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cultures suggested lack of adaptation to the human host . dr ##ome ##dar ##y viruses were as sensitive to the human type i inter ##fer ##on response as hc ##ov - 229 ##e . antibodies in human sera neutral ##ized dr ##ome ##dar ##y - derived viruses , suggesting population immunity against dr ##ome ##dar ##y viruses . although no current epidemic risk seems to em ##ana ##te from these viruses , evolutionary inference suggests that the endemic human virus hc ##ov - 229 ##e may constitute a descendant of camel ##id - associated viruses . hc ##ov - 229 ##e evolution provides a scenario for mer ##s - co ##v emergence .  
we report the development of an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . the ass ##ay was carried out with hyper ##im ##mun ##e poly ##cl ##onal nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id - specific antibodies from guinea pigs and rabbits im ##mun ##ized with rec ##om ##bina ##nt his ( 6 ) - tagged sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . the ass ##ay was used for the detection of sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate , urine , and fe ##cal samples collected from patients with confirmed sar ##s between days 2 and 33 after the onset of illness . the elisa was capable of detecting this protein in sar ##s co ##v cell culture l ##ys ##ates at 15 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive doses / ml but did not produce positive signals when tested with cell culture l ##ys ##ates of human corona ##virus ##es o ##c ##43 and 229 ##e . when tested with 120 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate , 100 urine , and 100 fe ##cal specimens from hospitalized patients without sar ##s , the ass ##ay was shown to have high specific ##ities — 96 . 7 , 99 , and 96 % , respectively . in an evaluation of clinical specimens from sar ##s patients , 34 ( 52 % ) of 66 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate samples from 50 patients , 5 ( 5 % ) of 94 urine samples from 94 patients , and 36 ( 55 % ) of 65 fe ##cal samples from 65 patients tested positive for sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein could be detected from days 6 to 24 in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate specimens , from days 11 to 31 in urine specimens , and from days 8 to 32 in fe ##cal specimens after the onset of illness . moreover , the protein could be detected in 25 ( 83 % ) of 30 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rate specimens obtained from days 11 to 15 and in all 7 fe ##cal specimens obtained from days 21 to 32 . since the present elisa is more convenient and economical than reverse transcription - pc ##r , it may serve as an alternative tool for the early diagnosis of sar ##s co ##v infection in laboratories with limited resources and expertise and for mass screening for the reservoir of sar ##s co ##v . further studies on serial clinical specimens should reveal the duration of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein shed ##ding and may reveal a higher detection rate in sar ##s patients .
the source of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic was traced to wildlife market ci ##vet ##s and ultimately to bats . subsequent hunting for novel corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 animal co ##vs , including the prototype lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is bat co ##v hk ##u ##4 and pip ##ist ##rell ##us bat co ##v hk ##u ##5 ; these are phylogenetic ##ally closely related to the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) co ##v , which has affected more than 1 , 000 patients with over 35 % fatal ##ity since its emergence in 2012 . all primary cases of mer ##s are ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly linked to the middle east . some of these patients had contacted camel ##s which shed virus and / or had positive ser ##ology . most secondary cases are related to health care - associated clusters . the disease is especially severe in elderly men with como ##rb ##idi ##ties . clinical severity may be related to mer ##s - co ##v ' s ability to in ##fect a broad range of cells with d ##pp ##4 expression , evade the host innate immune response , and induce cy ##tok ##ine d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation . reverse transcription - pc ##r on respiratory and / or extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis . supportive treatment with extra ##corp ##ore ##al membrane oxygen ##ation and dial ##ysis is often required in patients with organ failure . anti ##vira ##ls with potent in vitro activities include neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies , anti ##vira ##l peptide ##s , inter ##fer ##ons , my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid , and lo ##pina ##vir . they should be evaluated in suitable animal models before clinical trials . developing an effective camel mer ##s - co ##v vaccine and implementing appropriate infection control measures may control the continuing epidemic .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by a newly identified corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a serious emerging human infectious disease . in this report , we im ##mun ##ized fe ##rret ##s ( must ##ela put ##ori ##us fur ##o ) with rec ##om ##bina ##nt modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( rm ##va ) expressing the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein . im ##mun ##ized fe ##rret ##s developed a more rapid and vigorous neutral ##izing antibody response than control animals after challenge with sar ##s - co ##v ; however , they also exhibited strong inflammatory responses in liver tissue . inflammation in control animals exposed to sar ##s - co ##v was relatively mild . thus , our data suggest that va ##cci ##nation with rm ##va expressing sar ##s - co ##v s protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of a respiratory disease that has a 10 % mortality rate . we previously showed that sar ##s - co ##v lacking the e gene ( sar ##s - co ##v - δ ##e ) is at ##ten ##uated in several animal model systems . here , we show that absence of the e protein resulted in reduced expression of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines , decreased numbers of ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s in lung infiltrate ##s , diminished lung pathology , and increased mouse survival , suggesting that lung inflammation contributed to sar ##s - co ##v vi ##ru ##lence . further , infection with sar ##s - co ##v - δ ##e resulted in decreased activation of n ##f - κ ##b compared to levels for the wild - type virus . most important , treatment with drugs that inhibit ##ed n ##f - κ ##b activation led to a reduction in inflammation and lung pathology in both sar ##s - co ##v - infected culture ##d cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sar ##s - co ##v infection . these data indicated that activation of the n ##f - κ ##b signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sar ##s - co ##v infection and that n ##f - κ ##b inhibitors are promising anti ##vira ##ls in infections caused by sar ##s - co ##v and potentially other pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es .  
traditional approaches to anti ##mic ##ro ##bial drug development are poorly suited to combat ##ting the emergence of novel pathogen ##s . additionally , the lack of small animal models for these infections hind ##ers the in vivo testing of potential therapeutic ##s . here we demonstrate the use of the ve ##lo ##ci ##mm ##une technology ( a mouse that expresses human antibody - variable heavy chains and κ light chains ) alongside the ve ##lo ##ci ##gen ##e technology ( which allows for rapid engineering of the mouse genome ) to quickly develop and evaluate antibodies against an emerging viral disease . specifically , we show the rapid generation of fully human neutral ##izing antibodies against the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and development of a human ##ized mouse model for mer ##s - co ##v infection , which was used to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the isolated antibodies . the ve ##lo ##ci ##mm ##une and ve ##lo ##ci ##gen ##e technologies are powerful platforms that can be used to rapidly respond to emerging epidemic ##s .  
in view of a recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , there is a high demand for production of a vaccine to prevent this disease . recent studies indicate that sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spike protein ( s protein ) and its truncated fragments are considered the best candidates for generation of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine . toward the development of a safe , effective , and inexpensive vaccine candidate , we have expressed the n - terminal fragment of sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( s ##1 ) in tomato and low - nico ##tine tobacco plants . incorporation of the s ##1 fragment into plant genome ##s as well as its transcription was confirmed by pc ##r and rt - pc ##r analyses . high levels of expression of rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##1 protein were observed in several trans ##genic lines by western b ##lot analysis using specific antibodies . plant - derived antigen was evaluated to induce the systemic and mu ##cos ##al immune responses in mice . mice showed significantly increased levels of sar ##s - co ##v - specific i ##ga after oral ing ##est ##ion of tomato fruits expressing s ##1 protein . sera of mice parent ##eral ##ly prime ##d with tobacco - derived s ##1 protein revealed the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - specific i ##gg as detected by western b ##lot and elisa analysis .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) generates 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##p ' s ) through pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of a large precursor protein . although several ns ##p ' s exhibit catalytic activities that are important for viral replication and transcription , other ns ##p ' s have less clearly defined roles during an infection . in order to gain a better understanding of their functions , we attempted to identify host proteins that interact with ns ##p ' s during sar ##s - co ##v infections . for ns ##p ##2 , we identified an interaction with two host proteins , prohibit ##in 1 ( ph ##b ##1 ) and ph ##b ##2 . our results suggest that ns ##p ##2 may be involved in the disruption of intra ##cellular host signaling during sar ##s - co ##v infections .  
a del ##eti ##on mutant of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been engineered by del ##eti ##ng the structural e gene in an infectious cd ##na clone that was constructed as a bacterial artificial chromosome ( ba ##c ) . the rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus lacking the e gene ( rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e ) was rescued in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . the recovered del ##eti ##on mutant grew in ve ##ro e ##6 , huh - 7 , and ca ##co - 2 cells to ti ##ters 20 - , 200 - , and 200 - fold lower than the rec ##om ##bina ##nt wild - type virus , respectively , indicating that although the e protein has an effect on growth , it is not essential for virus replication . no differences in vi ##rion stability under a wide range of ph and temperature were detected between the del ##eti ##on mutant and rec ##om ##bina ##nt wild - type viruses . although both viruses showed the same morphology by electron microscopy , the process of mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis seemed to be less efficient with the defective virus than with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt wild - type one . the rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e virus replicate ##d to ti ##ters 100 - to 1 , 000 - fold lower than the rec ##om ##bina ##nt wild - type virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract of ham ##sters , and the lower viral load was accompanied by less inflammation in the lungs of ham ##sters infected with rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e virus than with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt wild - type virus . therefore , the sar ##s - co ##v that lacks the e gene is at ##ten ##uated in ham ##sters , might be a safer research tool , and may be a good candidate for the development of a live at ##ten ##uated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was caused by a novel virus now known as sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the discovery of sar ##s - co ##v - like viruses in masked palm ci ##vet ##s ( pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta ) raises the possibility that ci ##vet ##s play a role in sar ##s - co ##v transmission . to test the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of ci ##vet ##s to experimental infection by different sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , 10 ci ##vet ##s were in ##oc ##ulated with two human isolate ##s of sar ##s - co ##v , b ##j ##01 ( with a 29 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on ) and g ##z ##01 ( without the 29 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on ) . all in ##oc ##ulated animals displayed clinical symptoms , such as fever , let ##har ##gy , and loss of aggressive ##ness , and the infection was confirmed by virus isolation , detection of viral gen ##omic rna , and serum - neutral ##izing antibodies . our data show that ci ##vet ##s were equally susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s g ##z ##01 and b ##j ##01 .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( mer ##s corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v ) . since its first emergence in 2012 , multiple transmission events of mer ##s - co ##v ( dr ##ome ##dar ##y to human and human to human ) have been reported , indicating that mer ##s - co ##v has the potential to cause widespread outbreak . however , the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s as well as immune responses against the virus in animal models and patients are still not well understood , hind ##ering the vaccine and therapeutic developments . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize recent genetic and epidemic findings of mer ##s - co ##v and the progress in animal model development , immune response studies in both animals and humans . at last , we discussed the breakthrough on vaccine and therapeutic development which are important against potential future mer ##s outbreak .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was discovered during a recent global outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . a number of im ##mun ##olo ##gic and molecular studies of the clinical samples led to the conclusion that a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was associated with the outbreak . later , a sar ##s res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing gene ##chi ##p was developed by af ##fy ##met ##rix to character ##ize the complete genome of sar ##s - co ##v on a single gene ##chi ##p . the present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of sar ##s res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing gene ##chi ##ps . two human sar ##s - co ##v strains ( cdc # 2003 ##01 ##15 ##7 and urban ##i ) were res ##e ##que ##nce ##d by the sar ##s gene ##chi ##ps . five overlapping pc ##r amp ##lic ##ons were generated for each strain and hybrid ##ized with these gene ##chi ##ps . the successfully hybrid ##ized gene ##chi ##ps generated nu ##cle ##otide sequences of nearly complete genome ##s for the two sar ##s - co ##v strains with an average call rate of 94 . 6 % . multiple alignment ##s of nu ##cle ##otide sequences obtained from sar ##s gene ##chi ##ps and conventional sequencing revealed full concord ##ance . furthermore , the gene ##chi ##p - based analysis revealed no additional poly ##morphic sites . the results of this study suggest that gene ##chi ##p - based genome characterization is fast and rep ##rod ##ucible . thus , sar ##s res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing gene ##chi ##ps may be employed as an alternate tool to obtain genome sequences of sar ##s - co ##v strains pathogen ##ic for humans in order to further understand the transmission dynamics of these viruses .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) have recently emerged as potentially serious pathogen ##s that can cause significant human mor ##bid ##ity and death . the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v was identified as the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of the 2002 - 3 international sar ##s outbreak . yet how sar ##s evade ##s innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood . here , we show that a protein encoded by sar ##s - co ##v designated as open reading frame - 9 ##b ( or ##f - 9 ##b ) local ##izes to mit ##och ##ond ##ria and causes mitochondrial el ##onga ##tion by triggering u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion and pro ##tea ##som ##al degradation of d ##yna ##min - like protein ( dr ##p ##1 ) , a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission . also , acting on mit ##och ##ond ##ria or ##f - 9 ##b targets the mitochondrial - associated adapt ##or molecule ma ##vs signal ##oso ##me by us ##ur ##ping poly ( c ) - binding protein 2 ( pc ##b ##p ##2 ) and the he ##ct domain e ##3 liga ##se ai ##p ##4 to trigger the degradation of ma ##vs , tr ##af ##3 , and tr ##af ##6 . this severely limits host cell inter ##fer ##on responses . reducing either pc ##b ##p ##2 or ai ##p ##4 expression substantially reversed the or ##f - 9 ##b mediated reduction of ma ##vs and the suppression of anti - viral transcription ##al responses . finally , transient or ##f - 9 ##b expression led to a strong induction of auto ##pha ##gy in cells . the induction of auto ##pha ##gy depended upon at ##g ##5 , a critical auto ##pha ##gy regulator , but the inhibition of ma ##vs signaling did not . these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v or ##f - 9 ##b manipulate ##s host cell mit ##och ##ond ##ria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity . this study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v infection and illustrates the havoc that a small open reading frame can cause in cells .  
four corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 ) are endemic in humans and mainly associated with mild respiratory illnesses ; whereas the other two corona ##virus ##es [ severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ] present as emerging infections causing severe respiratory syndrome . corona ##virus ##es evolve by accumulation of point mutations and rec ##om ##bina ##tion of genome ##s among different strains or species . mammalian corona ##virus ##es including those in ##fect humans are evolved from bat corona ##virus ##es . while sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v are genetically closely related to bat corona ##virus ##es , intermediate host ( s ) is ( are ) likely to be involved in the emergence and cross - species transmission of these novel human viruses . high prevalence of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es have been found from masked palm ci ##vet cats and ra ##cco ##on dogs collected from markets around the time of outbreak ##s in humans , but these animals are likely to be a transient accidental host rather than a persist ##ing reservoir . more research is needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te the ecology of corona ##virus ##es . vi ##gil ##ance and surveillance should be maintained to promptly identify newly emerged corona ##virus ##es .  
like other corona ##virus ##es , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) assemble ##s at and buds into the lu ##men of the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) - go ##l ##gi intermediate compartment ( er ##gic ) . accumulation of the viral envelope proteins at this compartment is a pre ##re ##quisite for virus assembly . previously , we reported the identification of a di ##bas ##ic motif ( k ##x ##h ##xx ) in the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of the sar ##s co ##v spike ( s ) protein that was similar to a canonical dil ##ys ##ine er retrieval signal . here we demonstrate that this motif is a novel and functional er retrieval signal which reduced the rate of traffic of the full - length s protein through the go ##l ##gi complex . the k ##x ##h ##xx motif also partially retained two different reporter proteins in the er ##gic region and reduced their rates of trafficking , although the motif was less potent than the canonical dil ##ys ##ine signal . the di ##bas ##ic motif bound the coat ##ome ##r complex i ( cop ##i ) in an in vitro binding ass ##ay , suggesting that er retrieval may contribute to the accumulation of sar ##s co ##v s protein near the virus assembly site for interaction with other viral structural proteins . in support of this , we found that the di ##bas ##ic motif on the sar ##s s protein was required for its local ##ization to the er ##gic / go ##l ##gi region when coe ##x ##pressed with sar ##s membrane ( m ) protein . thus , the cycling of sar ##s s through the er - go ##l ##gi system may be required for its incorporation into ass ##em ##bling vi ##rion ##s in the er ##gic .  
the novel emerging corona ##virus middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) binds to its receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , via 14 interacting amino acids . we previously showed that if the five interacting amino acids which differ between ham ##ster and human d ##pp ##4 are changed to the residues found in human d ##pp ##4 , ham ##ster d ##pp ##4 does act as a receptor . here , we show that the functionality of ham ##ster d ##pp ##4 as a receptor is severely decreased if less than 4 out of 5 amino acids are changed . importance the novel emerging corona ##virus mer ##s - co ##v has infected > 1 , 600 people worldwide , and the case fatal ##ity rate is [UNK] % . in this study , we show that by changing 4 amino acids in ham ##ster d ##pp ##4 , this protein functions as a receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . this work is vital in the development of new small - animal models , which will broad ##en our understanding of mer ##s - co ##v and be instrumental in the development of counter ##me ##as ##ures .  
a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) has been identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the sar ##s - co ##v genome en ##codes the characteristic essential co ##v replication and structural proteins . additionally , the genome contains six group - specific open reading frames ( or ##fs ) larger than 50 amino acids , with no known homo ##logue ##s . as with the group - specific genes of the other co ##vs , little is known about the sar ##s - co ##v group - specific genes . sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##7 ##a en ##codes a put ##ative unique 122 - amino - acid protein , designated u ##12 ##2 in this study . the de ##duced sequence contains a probable cl ##ea ##ved signal sequence and a c - terminal trans ##me ##mb ##rane helix , indicating that u ##12 ##2 is likely to be a type i membrane protein . the c - terminal tail also contains a typical end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) retrieval motif , k ##rk ##te . u ##12 ##2 was expressed in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells , as it could be detected by western b ##lot and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence analyses . u ##12 ##2 is localized to the per ##in ##uc ##lea ##r region of both sar ##s - co ##v - infected and trans ##fect ##ed cells and col ##oca ##lized with er and intermediate compartment markers . mutation ##al analyses showed that both the signal peptide sequence and er retrieval motif were functional .  
a previously und ##es ##cr ##ibe ##d corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . using a panel of contiguous cd ##nas that span the entire genome , we have assembled a full - length cd ##na of the sar ##s - co ##v urban ##i strain , and have rescued molecular ##ly clone ##d sar ##s viruses ( infectious clone sar ##s - co ##v ) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones . rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses replicate ##d as efficiently as w ##t virus and both were inhibit ##ed by treatment with the cy ##stein ##e protein ##ase inhibitor ( 2 ##s , 3 ##s ) - trans ##ep ##ox ##ys ##ucci ##ny ##l - l - le ##uc ##yla ##mi ##do - 3 - methyl ##bu ##tan ##e et ##hyl este ##r . in addition , sub ##gen ##omic transcript ##s were initiated from the consensus sequence ac ##ga ##ac in both the w ##t and infectious clone sar ##s - co ##v . availability of a sar ##s - co ##v full - length cd ##na provides a template for manipulation of the viral genome , allowing for the rapid and rational development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutic ##s against this important human pathogen .  
our knowledge regarding immune - protective and im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogenic events in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection is limited , and little is known about the dynamics of the immune response at the primary site of disease . here , an african green monkey ( ag ##m ) model was used to el ##uc ##ida ##te immune mechanisms that facilitate viral clearance but may also contribute to persistent lung inflammation following sar ##s - co ##v infection . during primary infection , sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##d in the ag ##m lung for up to 10 days . interesting ##ly , lung inflammation was more prevalent following viral clearance , as le ##uk ##oc ##yte numbers peaked at 14 days post ##in ##fect ##ion ( d ##pi ) and remained elevated at 28 d ##pi compared to those of mock - infected controls . lung macro ##pha ##ges but not den ##dr ##itic cells were rapidly activated , and both cell types had high activation marker expression at late infection time points . lung pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines were induced at 1 to 14 d ##pi , but most returned to baseline by 28 d ##pi except inter ##le ##uki ##n 12 ( il - 12 ) and gamma inter ##fer ##on . in sar ##s - co ##v homo ##log ##ous rec ##hall ##eng ##e studies , 11 of the 12 animals were free of replica ##ting virus at day 5 after rec ##hall ##eng ##e . however , incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced despite the limited viral replication upon rec ##hall ##eng ##e . evaluating the role of antibodies in immune protection or potent ##iation revealed a progressive increase in anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies in lung and serum that did not co ##rre ##late temporal ##ly or spatial ##ly with enhanced viral replication . this study represents one of the first comprehensive analyses of lung immunity , including changes in le ##uk ##oc ##yte populations , lung - specific cy ##tok ##ines , and antibody responses following sar ##s - co ##v rec ##hall ##eng ##e in ag ##ms .  
the outcome of a viral infection is regulated in part by the complex coordination of viral and host interactions that compete for the control and optimization of virus replication . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) intimately engages and regulates the host innate immune responses during infection . using a novel inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) ant ##ago ##nism screen , we show that the sar ##s - co ##v pro ##te ##ome contains several replica ##se , structural , and accessory proteins that ant ##ago ##ni ##ze the if ##n pathway . in this study , we focus on the sar ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##p ) , which engages and ant ##ago ##ni ##zes the if ##n induction and n ##f - κ ##b signaling pathways . pl ##p blocks these pathways by affecting activation of the important signaling proteins in each pathway , ir ##f ##3 and n ##f - κ ##b . we also show that the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like domain of pl ##p is necessary for pathway ant ##ago ##nism but not sufficient by itself to block these pathways regardless of the en ##zy ##matic activity of the pro ##tea ##se . the potential mechanism of pl ##p ant ##ago ##nism and its role in pathogen ##esis are discussed .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a life - threatening disease caused by a newly identified corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , sar ##s - co ##v . the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of co ##v is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus neutral ##ization by antibodies . hence , knowledge of neutral ##ization deter ##mina ##nts on the s protein is helpful for designing protective vaccines . to analyze the antigen ##ic structure of the sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 domain , the car ##box ##yl - terminal half of the s protein , we first used sera from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients to test the antigen ##ici ##ty of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire s ##2 and identified two antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts ( le ##u 80 ##3 to ala 82 ##8 and pro 106 ##1 to ser 109 ##3 ) . to determine whether neutral ##izing antibodies can be eli ##cite ##d by these two deter ##mina ##nts , we im ##mun ##ized animals and found that both of them could induce the s ##2 - specific anti ##ser ##a . in some animals , however , only one deter ##mina ##nt ( le ##u 80 ##3 to ala 82 ##8 ) was able to induce the anti ##ser ##a with the binding ability to the native s protein and the neutral ##izing activity to the sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus . this deter ##mina ##nt is highly conserved across different sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s . identification of a conserved antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt on the s ##2 domain of the sar ##s - co ##v s protein , which has the potential for inducing neutral ##izing antibodies , has implications in the development of effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v .  
with an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoo ##not ##ic strains , new strategies are required to prepare for the next emerge ##nt corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . previously , groups had targeted conserved corona ##virus proteins as a strategy to generate live at ##ten ##uated vaccine strains against current and future co ##vs . with this in mind , we explored whether manipulation of co ##v ns ##p ##16 , a conserved 2 ′ o methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( mt ##ase ) , could provide a broad at ##ten ##uation platform against future emerge ##nt strains . using the severe acute respiratory syndrome - co ##v mouse model , an ns ##p ##16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge , efficacy in the aging host , and potential for rev ##ers ##ion to pathogen ##esis . despite some success , concerns for vi ##ru ##lence in the aged and potential for rev ##ers ##ion makes targeting ns ##p ##16 alone an un ##ten ##able approach . however , combining a 2 ′ o mt ##ase mutation with a previously described co ##v fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous virus challenge , efficacy in aged mice , and no evidence for rev ##ers ##ion . together , the results indicate that targeting the co ##v 2 ′ o mt ##ase in parallel with other conserved at ##ten ##uating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live at ##ten ##uated corona ##virus vaccines . importance emerge ##nt corona ##virus ##es remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreak ##s . however , failure of many previous co ##v vaccine formulation ##s has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations such as the aged and im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised . this study illustrates that despite success in young models , the 2 ′ o methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se mutant carries too much risk for pathogen ##esis and rev ##ers ##ion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand - alone vaccine strategy . importantly , the 2 ′ o methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se mutation can be paired with other at ##ten ##uating approaches to provide robust protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge and in vulnerable populations . coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogen ##esis , the study highlights the potential for 2 ′ o methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se at ##ten ##uation as a major component of future live at ##ten ##uated corona ##virus vaccines .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a previously unidentified corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , likely transmitted to humans by infected camel ##s . there is no licensed vaccine or anti ##vira ##l for mer ##s , therefore new prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are needed . in this study , we describe , for the first time , to our knowledge , the isolation of a potent mer ##s - co ##v – neutral ##izing antibody from memory b cells of an infected individual . the antibody , named lc ##a ##60 , binds to a novel site on the spike protein and potent ##ly neutral ##izes infection of multiple mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s by interfering with the binding to the cellular receptor cd ##26 . importantly , using mice trans ##duced with aden ##ov ##irus expressing human cd ##26 and infected with mer ##s - co ##v , we show that lc ##a ##60 can effectively protect in both prop ##hyl ##actic and post ##ex ##po ##sure settings . this antibody can be used for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is , for post ##ex ##po ##sure prop ##hyl ##ax ##is of individuals at risk , or for the treatment of human cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection . the fact that it took only 4 mo from the initial screening of b cells derived from a con ##vale ##scent patient for the development of a stable chinese ham ##ster o ##vary ( cho ) cell line producing neutral ##izing antibodies at more than 5 g / l provides an example of a rapid pathway toward the generation of effective anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies against emerging viruses .  
in 2012 , the first cases of infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) were identified . since then , more than 1 , 000 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection have been confirmed ; infection is typically associated with considerable mor ##bid ##ity and , in approximately 30 % of cases , mortality . currently , there is no protective vaccine available . replication - competent rec ##om ##bina ##nt me ##as ##les virus ( mv ) expressing foreign antigen ##s constitutes a promising tool to induce protective immunity against corresponding pathogen ##s . therefore , we generated mv ##s expressing the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of mer ##s - co ##v in its full - length ( mer ##s - s ) or a truncated , soluble variant of mer ##s - s ( mer ##s - sol ##s ) . the genes encoding mer ##s - s and mer ##s - sol ##s were clone ##d into the vaccine strain mv ( va ##c ##2 ) genome , and the respective viruses were rescued ( mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - s and mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - sol ##s ) . these rec ##om ##bina ##nt mv ##s were amplified and characterized at passages 3 and 10 . the replication of mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - s in ve ##ro cells turned out to be comparable to that of the control virus mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - g ##fp ( encoding green fluorescent protein ) , while ti ##ters of mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - sol ##s were impaired approximately 3 - fold . the gen ##omic stability and expression of the inserted antigen ##s were confirmed via sequencing of viral cd ##na and im ##mun ##ob ##lot analysis . in vivo , im ##mun ##ization of type i inter ##fer ##on receptor - def ##icient ( if ##nar ( − / − ) ) - cd ##46 ##ge mice with 2 × 10 ( 5 ) 50 % tissue culture in ##fect ##ive doses of mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - s ( h ) or mv ( va ##c ##2 ) - co ##v - sol ##s ( h ) in a prime - boost regime ##n induced robust levels of both mv - and mer ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing antibodies . additionally , induction of specific t cells was demonstrated by t cell proliferation , antigen - specific t cell cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city , and gamma inter ##fer ##on secret ##ion after stimulation of sp ##len ##ocytes with mer ##s - co ##v - s presented by mu ##rine den ##dr ##itic cells . mer ##s - co ##v challenge experiments indicated the protective capacity of these immune responses in va ##cci ##nated mice . importance although mer ##s - co
the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) domain from the deadly middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was over ##ex ##pressed and pu ##rified . mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro construct ##s with and without the put ##ative u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like ( u ##bl ) domain at the n terminus were found to possess pro ##tea ##se , de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating , dei ##sg ##yla ##ting , and inter ##fer ##on ant ##ago ##nism activities in trans ##fect ##ed he ##k ##29 ##3 ##t cells . the qu ##ater ##nary structure and substrate preferences of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro were determined and compared to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) pl ##pro , revealing prominent differences between these closely related enzymes . steady - state kinetic analyses of pu ##rified mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro ##s uncovered significant differences in their rates of hydro ##lysis of 5 - amino ##met ##hyl co ##uma ##rin ( amc ) from c - terminal ##ly labeled peptide , u ##bi ##qui ##tin , and is ##g ##15 substrates , as well as in their rates of iso ##pe ##pt ##ide bond cleavage of k ##48 - and k ##6 ##3 - linked poly ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in chains . mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro was found to have 8 - fold and 3 , 500 - fold higher catalytic e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies for hydro ##lysis of is ##g ##15 - amc than for hydro ##lysis of the u ##b - amc and z - r ##lr ##gg - amc substrates , respectively . a similar trend was observed for sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , although it was much more efficient than mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro toward is ##g ##15 - amc and peptide - amc substrates . mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro was found to process k ##48 - and k ##6 ##3 - linked poly ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in chains at similar rates and with similar debra ##nch ##ing patterns , producing mono ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in species . however , sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro much preferred k ##48 - linked poly ##ub ##iq ##uit ##in chains to k ##6 ##3 - linked chains , and it rapidly produced di - u ##bi ##qui ##tin molecules from k ##48 - linked chains . finally , potent inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro were found to have no effect on mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . a homo ##logy model of the mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro structure was generated and compared to the x - ray structure of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro to provide plausible explanations for differences in substrate and inhibitor recognition . importance unlock ##ing the secrets of
the emergence of new viral infections of man requires the development of robust diagnostic tests that can be applied in the differential diagnosis of acute illness , or to determine past exposure , so as to establish the true burden of disease . since the recognition in april 2003 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , enormous efforts have been applied to develop molecular and ser ##ological tests for sar ##s which can assist rapid detection of cases , accurate diagnosis of illness and the application of control measures . international progress in the laboratory diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v infection during acute illness has led to internationally agreed world health organization criteria for the confirmation of sar ##s . developments in the di ##sse ##ction of the human immune response to sar ##s indicate that ser ##ological tests on con ##vale ##scent sera are essential to confirm sar ##s infection , given the sub - optimal predict ##ive value of molecular detection tests performed during acute sar ##s illness .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 in saudi arabia and has caused over 240 ##0 cases and more than 800 deaths . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies identified diabetes as the primary como ##rb ##idi ##ty associated with severe or lethal mer ##s - co ##v infection . understanding how diabetes affects mer ##s is important because of the global burden of diabetes and pan ##de ##mic potential of mer ##s - co ##v . we used a model in which mice were made susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v by expressing human d ##pp ##4 , and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high - fat diet . upon infection with mer ##s - co ##v , dia ##bet ##ic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery that was independent of virus ti ##ters . his ##to ##logical analysis revealed that dia ##bet ##ic mice had delayed inflammation , which was then prolonged through 21 days after infection . dia ##bet ##ic mice had fewer inflammatory mono ##cy ##te / macro ##pha ##ges and cd ##4 ( + ) t cells , which correlated with lower levels of cc ##l ##2 and c ##x ##cl ##10 expression . dia ##bet ##ic mice also had lower levels of tn ##fa , il ##6 , il ##12 ##b , and ar ##g ##1 expression and higher levels of il ##17 ##a expression . these data suggest that the increased disease severity observed in individuals with mer ##s and como ##rb ##id type 2 diabetes is likely due to a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated immune response , which results in more severe and prolonged lung pathology .  
an antigen detection ass ##ay for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus was established in this study by an indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence test , which utilized cells derived from throat wash samples of patients with sar ##s and a rabbit serum that recognized the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) but not that of other human corona ##virus tested . it detected sar ##s - co ##v in 11 of 17 ( 65 % ) samples from sar ##s patients as early as day 2 of illness but in none of the 10 samples from healthy controls . compared with other diagnostic mod ##ali ##ties for detecting sar ##s - co ##v , this ass ##ay is simpler , more convenient , and economical . it could be an alternative for early and rapid diagnosis , should sar ##s return in the future .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has recently emerged as a ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe respiratory disease in humans . here , we constructed rec ##om ##bina ##nt modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) expressing full - length mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein ( mv ##a - mer ##s - s ) . the genetic stability and growth characteristics of mv ##a - mer ##s - s make it a suitable candidate vaccine for clinical testing . va ##cci ##nated mice produced high levels of serum antibodies neutral ##izing mer ##s - co ##v . thus , mv ##a - mer ##s - s may serve for further development of an emergency vaccine against mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) replicate ##s in cells of different species using dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) as a functional receptor . here we show the resistance of fe ##rret ##s to mer ##s - co ##v infection and inability of fe ##rret dd ##p ##4 to bind mer ##s - co ##v . site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is of amino acids variable in fe ##rret d ##pp ##4 thus revealed the functional human d ##pp ##4 virus binding site . aden ##osi ##ne dea ##mina ##se ( ada ) , a d ##pp ##4 binding protein , competed for virus binding , acting as a natural antagonist for mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome - like disease with [UNK] % mortality . given the recent detection of virus in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , zoo ##not ##ic transfer of mer ##s - co ##v to humans is suspected . in addition , little is known about the role of human neutral ##izing ab ( na ##b ) pressure as a driving force in mer ##s - co ##v adaptive evolution . here , we used a well - characterized non ##im ##mun ##e human ab - ph ##age library and a pan ##ning strategy with pro ##te ##oli ##po ##some ##s and cells to identify seven human na ##bs against the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . these na ##bs bind to three different ep ##ito ##pes in the rb ##d and human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) interface with sub ##nan ##omo ##lar / nano ##mo ##lar binding af ##fin ##ities and block the binding of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein with its hd ##pp ##4 receptor . escape mutant ass ##ays identified five amino acid residues that are critical for neutral ##ization escape . despite the close proximity of the three ep ##ito ##pes on the rb ##d interface , escape from one ep ##ito ##pe did not have a major impact on neutral ##ization with abs directed to a different ep ##ito ##pe . importantly , the majority of escape mutations had negative impacts on hd ##pp ##4 receptor binding and viral fitness . to our knowledge , these results provide the first report on human na ##bs against mer ##s - co ##v that may contribute to mer ##s - co ##v clearance and evolution . moreover , in the absence of a licensed vaccine or anti ##vira ##l for mer ##s , this panel of na ##bs offers the possibility of developing human mab - based im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py , especially for health - care workers .  
vaccine development for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has mainly focused on the spike ( s ) protein . however , the variation of the s gene between viruses may affect the efficacy of a vaccine , particularly for cross - protection against sar ##s - like co ##v ( sl - co ##v ) . recently , a more conserved group - specific open reading frame ( or ##f ) , the 3a gene , was found in both sar ##s - co ##v and sl - co ##v . here , we studied the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of human sar ##s - co ##v 3a and bat sl - co ##v 3a dna vaccines in mice through electro ##por ##ation im ##mun ##ization followed by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent , enzyme - linked im ##mun ##os ##pot , and flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry ass ##ays . our results showed that high levels of specific humor ##al responses were induced by sar ##s - co ##v 3a and sl - co ##v 3a dna vaccines . furthermore , a strong th ##1 - based cellular immune response was stimulated by both dna vaccines . the vaccines stimulated gamma inter ##fer ##on production mainly by cd ##8 ( + ) t cells and inter ##le ##uki ##n - 2 ( il - 2 ) mainly by cd ##4 ( + ) t cells . of interest , the frequency of il - 2 - positive cells eli ##cite ##d by the sar ##s - co ##v 3a dna vaccine was significantly higher than that eli ##cite ##d by the sl - co ##v 3a dna vaccine . in summary , our study provides a reference for designing cross - protective dna vaccines based on the group - specific or ##fs of co ##vs .  
ns ##p ##1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a group 2 ##b co ##v , suppress ##es host gene expression by promoting host mrna degradation and translation inhibition . the present study analyzed the activities of ns ##p ##1 proteins from the group 2 bat co ##v strains rm ##1 , 133 , and hk ##u ##9 - 1 , belonging to groups 2 ##b , 2 ##c , and 2d , respectively . the host mrna degradation and translation ##al suppression activities of ns ##p ##1 of sar ##s - co ##v and rm ##1 ns ##p ##1 were similar and stronger than the activities of the ns ##p ##1 proteins of 133 and hk ##u ##9 - 1 . rm ##1 ns ##p ##1 expression in trans strongly inhibit ##ed the induction of type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - i ) and if ##n - stimulated genes in cells infected with an if ##n - inducing sar ##s - co ##v mutant , while 133 and hk ##u ##9 - 1 ns ##p ##1 proteins had relatively moderate if ##n - inhibitor ##y activities . the results of our studies suggested a conserved function among ns ##p ##1 proteins of sar ##s - co ##v and group 2 bat co ##vs .  
nl ##6 ##3 corona ##virus ( nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v ) , a prevalent human respiratory virus , is the only group i corona ##virus known to use ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as its receptor . incident ##ally , ace ##2 is also used by group ii sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we investigated how different groups of corona ##virus ##es recognize the same receptor , whereas homo ##log ##ous group i corona ##virus ##es recognize different receptors . we determined the crystal structure of nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) complex ##ed with human ace ##2 . nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v rb ##d has a novel β - sandwich core structure consisting of 2 layers of β - sheets , presenting 3 disco ##nti ##nu ##ous receptor - binding motifs ( rb ##ms ) to bind ace ##2 . nl ##6 ##3 - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v have no structural homo ##logy in rb ##d cores or rb ##ms ; yet the 2 viruses recognize common ace ##2 regions , largely because of a “ virus - binding hot ##sp ##ot ” on ace ##2 . among group i corona ##virus ##es , rb ##d cores are conserved but rb ##ms are variable , explaining how these viruses recognize different receptors . these results provide a structural basis for understanding viral evolution and virus – receptor interactions .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious and life threatening disease , with a fatal ##ity rate of almost 10 % . the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent is a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , with animal reservoirs found in bats and other wild animals and thus the possibility of re ##eme ##rgen ##ce . in this study , we first investigated at 6 years post ##in ##fect ##ion whether sar ##s - specific memory t cells persist in sar ##s - recovered individuals , demonstrating that these subjects still possess poly ##fu ##nction ##al sar ##s - specific memory cd ##4 ( + ) and cd ##8 ( + ) t cells . a dominant memory cd ##8 ( + ) t cell response against sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##sp ##id protein ( np ; amino acids 216 to 225 ) was then defined in sar ##s - recovered individuals carrying h ##la - b * 40 : 01 , a h ##la - b molecule present in approximately one - quarter of subjects of asian ethnic ##ities . to rec ##ons ##ti ##tute such a cd ##8 ( + ) t cell response , we isolated the alpha and beta t cell receptors of the h ##la - b * 40 : 01 - restricted sar ##s - specific cd ##8 ( + ) t cells . using t cell receptor gene transfer , we generated sar ##s - specific red ##ire ##cted t cells from the l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes of normal individuals . these engineered cd ##8 ( + ) t cells displayed avid ##ity and functionality similar to that of natural sar ##s - specific memory cd ##8 ( + ) t cells . they were able to de ##gra ##nu ##late and produce gamma inter ##fer ##on , tumor nec ##rosis factor alpha , and macro ##pha ##ge inflammatory proteins 1 ##α and 1 ##β after antigen ##ic stimulation . since there is no effective treatment against sar ##s , these trans ##duced t cells specific for an im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant sar ##s ep ##ito ##pe may provide a new avenue for treatment during a sar ##s outbreak .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) utilizes dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) as an entry receptor . while bat , camel , and human d ##pp ##4 support mer ##s - co ##v infection , several d ##pp ##4 or ##th ##olo ##gs , including mouse , fe ##rret , ham ##ster , and guinea pig d ##pp ##4 , do not . previous work revealed that g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of mouse d ##pp ##4 plays a role in blocking mer ##s - co ##v infection . here , we tested whether g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion also acts as a deter ##mina ##nt of per ##mis ##si ##vity for fe ##rret , ham ##ster , and guinea pig d ##pp ##4 . we found that , while g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion plays an important role in these or ##th ##olo ##gs , additional sequence and structural deter ##mina ##nts impact their ability to act as functional receptors for mer ##s - co ##v . these results provide insight into d ##pp ##4 species - specific differences impact ##ing mer ##s - co ##v host range and better inform our understanding of virus - receptor interactions associated with disease emergence and host su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . importance mer ##s - co ##v is a recently emerged zoo ##not ##ic virus that is still circulating in the human population with an [UNK] % mortality rate . with no available vaccines or therapeutic ##s , the study of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis is crucial for its control and prevention . however , in vivo studies are limited because mer ##s - co ##v cannot in ##fect wild - type mice due to inc ##omp ##ati ##bilities between the virus spike and the mouse host cell receptor , mouse d ##pp ##4 ( md ##pp ##4 ) . specifically , md ##pp ##4 has a non ##con ##ser ##ved g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site that acts as a barrier to mer ##s - co ##v infection . thus , one mouse model strategy has been to modify the mouse genome to remove this g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site . here , we investigated whether g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion acts as a barrier to infection for other non ##per ##missive small - animal species , namely , fe ##rret , guinea pig , and ham ##ster . understanding the virus - receptor interactions for these d ##pp ##4 or ##th ##olo ##gs will help in the development of additional animal models while also revealing species - specific differences impact ##ing mer ##s - co ##v host range .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which uses ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as its receptor for cell entry . a group of sar ##s - like co ##vs ( sl - co ##vs ) has been identified in horseshoe bats . sl - co ##vs and sar ##s - co ##vs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities , with the main exception of the n terminus of the spike protein ( s ) , known to be responsible for receptor binding in co ##vs . in this study , we investigated the receptor usage of the sl - co ##v s by combining a human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus - based pseudo ##virus system with cell lines expressing the ace ##2 molecules of human , ci ##vet , or horseshoe bat . in addition to full - length s of sl - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v , a series of s chi ##mer ##as was constructed by insert ##ing different sequences of the sar ##s - co ##v s into the sl - co ##v s backbone . several important observations were made from this study . first , the sl - co ##v s was unable to use any of the three ace ##2 molecules as its receptor . second , the sar ##s - co ##v s failed to enter cells expressing the bat ace ##2 . third , the chi ##meric s covering the previously defined receptor - binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ace ##2 , albeit with different e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies for different construct ##s . fourth , a minimal insert region ( amino acids 310 to 51 ##8 ) was found to be sufficient to convert the sl - co ##v s from non - ace ##2 binding to human ace ##2 binding , indicating that the sl - co ##v s is largely compatible with sar ##s - co ##v s protein both in structure and in function . the significance of these findings in relation to virus origin , virus rec ##om ##bina ##tion , and host switching is discussed .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was recently identified as the et ##iology of sar ##s . the virus particle consists of four structural proteins : spike ( s ) , small envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) . recognition of a specific sequence , termed the packaging signal ( ps ) , by a virus n protein is often the first step in the assembly of viral rna , but the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of sar ##s - co ##v rna are not clear . in this study , ve ##ro e ##6 cells were cot ##ran ##sf ##ect ##ed with pl ##as ##mi ##ds encoding the four structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . this generated virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) of sar ##s - co ##v that can be partially pu ##rified on a disco ##nti ##nu ##ous su ##cr ##ose gradient from the culture medium . the v ##lp ##s bearing all four of the structural proteins have a density of about 1 . 132 g / cm ( 3 ) . western b ##lot analysis of the culture medium from trans ##fect ##ion experiments revealed that both e and m expressed alone could be released in sediment ##able particles and that e and m proteins are likely to form v ##lp ##s when they are coe ##x ##pressed . to examine the assembly of the viral gen ##omic rna , a pl ##as ##mi ##d representing the g ##fp - ps ##58 ##0 cd ##na fragment encompassing the viral gen ##omic rna from nu ##cle ##otide ##s 1971 ##5 to 202 ##9 ##4 inserted into the 3 ′ non ##co ##ding region of the green fluorescent protein ( g ##fp ) gene was constructed and applied to the cot ##ran ##sf ##ection experiments with the four structural proteins . the sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s thus produced were designated v ##lp ( g ##fp - ps ##58 ##0 ) . expression of g ##fp was detected in ve ##ro e ##6 cells infected with the v ##lp ( g ##fp - ps ##58 ##0 ) , indicating that g ##fp - ps ##58 ##0 rna can be assembled into the v ##lp ##s . nevertheless , when ve ##ro e ##6 cells were infected with v ##lp ##s produced in the absence of the viral n protein , no green flu ##orescence was visual ##ized . these results indicate that n protein has an essential role in the packaging of sar ##s - co ##v rna . a filter binding ass ##ay and competition analysis further demonstrated that the n - terminal and c - terminal regions of the sar ##s - co ##v n protein each contain a binding activity specific to the viral rna . del ##eti ##ons that presumably disrupt the structure of the n - terminal domain diminished its
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was the first natural disaster that challenged the chinese people at the beginning of the twenty - first century . it was caused by a novel animal corona ##virus , never recognized or characterized before . this sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) exploited opportunities provided by ‘ wet markets ’ in southern china to adapt to the palm ci ##vet and human . under the positive selection pressure of human host , certain mu ##tated lineage ##s of the virus became readily trans ##missible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002 – 2003 . this review will provide first - hand information , particularly from guangdong , china , about the initial ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , the identification of the ae ##ti ##ological agent of the disease , the molecular evolution study of the virus , the finding of sar ##s - like co ##v in horseshoe bats and the me ##chan ##istic analysis for the cross - host tr ##op ##ism transition . the substantial scientific contributions made by the chinese scientists towards understanding the virus and the disease will be emphasized . along with the description of the scientific discoveries and analyses , the significant impact of these researches upon the public health measurement or regulations will be highlighted . it is aimed to appreciate the concert ##ed and coordinated global response that controlled sar ##s within a short period of time as well as the research strategy and methodology developed along with this process , which can be applied in response to other public health challenges , particularly the future emerging / re - merging infectious diseases .  
outbreak ##s from zoo ##not ##ic sources represent a threat to both human disease as well as the global economy . despite a wealth of meta ##gen ##omics studies , methods to leverage these data ##set ##s to identify future threats are under ##dev ##elo ##ped . in this study , we describe an approach that combines existing meta ##gen ##omics data with reverse genetics to engineer re ##age ##nts to evaluate emergence and pathogen ##ic potential of circulating zoo ##not ##ic viruses . focusing on the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like viruses , the results indicate that the wi ##v ##1 - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) cluster has the ability to directly in ##fect and may undergo limited transmission in human populations . however , in vivo at ##ten ##uation suggests additional adaptation is required for epidemic disease . importantly , available sar ##s mono ##cl ##onal antibodies offered success in limiting viral infection absent from available vaccine approaches . together , the data highlight the utility of a platform to identify and prior ##iti ##ze prep ##and ##emi ##c strains harbor ##ed in animal reservoirs and document the threat posed by wi ##v ##1 - co ##v for emergence in human populations .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a relatively high mortality rate of approximately 40 % . mer ##s is caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , and no specific drugs or vaccines are currently available to prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection . mer ##s - co ##v is an enveloped virus , and its envelope protein ( s protein ) media ##tes membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or end ##osomal membrane . multiple pro ##te ##ol ##ysis by host pro ##tea ##ses , such as fur ##in , trans ##me ##mb ##rane pro ##tea ##se ser ##ine 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) , and cat ##he ##ps ##ins , causes the s protein to become fusion competent . t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , which is localized to the plasma membrane , is a ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se responsible for the pro ##te ##ol ##ysis of s in the post - receptor - binding stage . here , we developed a cell - based fusion ass ##ay for s in a t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - dependent manner using cell lines expressing ren ##illa lucifer ##ase ( r ##l ) - based split reporter proteins . s was stab ##ly expressed in the effect ##or cells , and the corresponding receptor for s , cd ##26 , was stab ##ly coe ##x ##pressed with t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 in the target cells . membrane fusion between these effect ##or and target cells was quantitative ##ly measured by determining the r ##l activity . the ass ##ay was opt ##imi ##zed for a 38 ##4 - well format , and na ##fa ##most ##at , a ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se inhibitor , was identified as a potent inhibitor of s - mediated membrane fusion in a screening of about 1 , 000 drugs approved for use by the u . s . food and drug administration . na ##fa ##most ##at also blocked mer ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . our ass ##ay has the potential to facilitate the discovery of new inhibitors of membrane fusion of mer ##s - co ##v as well as other viruses that rely on the activity of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ns ##p ##1 suppress ##es host gene expression in expressed cells by inhibit ##ing translation and inducing end ##on ##uc ##le ##ol ##ytic cleavage of host mrna ##s , the latter of which leads to mrna decay . we examined the biological functions of ns ##p ##1 in infected cells and its role in virus replication by using wild - type mer ##s - co ##v and two mutant viruses with specific mutations in the ns ##p ##1 ; one mutant lacked both biological functions , while the other lacked the rna cleavage function but retained the translation inhibition function . in ve ##ro cells , all three viruses replicate ##d efficiently with similar replication kinetic ##s , while wild - type virus induced stronger host translation ##al suppression and host mrna degradation than the mutants , demonstrating that ns ##p ##1 suppressed host gene expression in infected cells . the mutant viruses replicate ##d less efficiently than wild - type virus in huh - 7 cells , he ##la - derived cells , and 293 - derived cells , the latter two of which stab ##ly expressed a viral receptor protein . in 293 - derived cells , the three viruses accumulated similar levels of ns ##p ##1 and major viral structural proteins and did not induce if ##n - β and if ##n - λ mrna ##s ; however , both mutants were unable to generate intra ##cellular virus particles as efficiently as wild - type virus , leading to in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt production of infectious viruses . these data strongly suggest that the end ##on ##uc ##le ##ol ##ytic rna cleavage function of the ns ##p ##1 promoted mer ##s - co ##v assembly and / or bud ##ding in a 293 - derived cell line . mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 represents the first co ##v gene 1 protein that plays an important role in virus assembly / bud ##ding and is the first identified viral protein whose rna cleavage - inducing function promotes virus assembly / bud ##ding . importance mer ##s - co ##v represents a high public health threat . because co ##v ns ##p ##1 is a major viral vi ##ru ##lence factor , uncover ##ing the biological functions of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 could contribute to our understanding of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##ici ##ty and spur development of medical counter ##me ##as ##ures . expressed mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 suppress ##es host gene expression , but its biological functions for virus replication and effects on host gene expression in infected cells are largely une ##x ##pl ##ored . we found that ns ##p ##1 suppressed host gene expression in infected cells . our data further demonstrated that ns ##p ##1 , which was not detected in virus particles , promoted virus assembly or bud ##ding in a 293 - derived cell line ,
studies of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) demonstrate that the respiratory tract is a major site of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection and disease mor ##bid ##ity . we studied host - pathogen interactions using native lung tissue and a model of well - differentiated cultures of primary human air ##way ep ##ith ##elia . ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the receptor for both the sar ##s - co ##v and the related human respiratory corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 , was expressed in human air ##way ep ##ith ##elia as well as lung par ##en ##chy ##ma . as assessed by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing and membrane bio ##tin ##yla ##tion , ace ##2 protein was more abundant ##ly expressed on the apical than the bas ##olate ##ral surface of polar ##ized air ##way ep ##ith ##elia . interesting ##ly , ace ##2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of ep ##ith ##elia . und ##iff ##ere ##nti ##ated cells expressing little ace ##2 were poorly infected with sar ##s - co ##v , while well - differentiated cells expressing more ace ##2 were readily infected . expression of ace ##2 in poorly differentiated ep ##ith ##elia facilitated sar ##s spike ( s ) protein - pseudo ##type ##d virus entry . consistent with the expression pattern of ace ##2 , the entry of sar ##s - co ##v or a lent ##iv ##irus pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v s protein in differentiated ep ##ith ##elia was more efficient when applied to the apical surface . furthermore , sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##d in polar ##ized ep ##ith ##elia and prefer ##ential ##ly exited via the apical surface . the results indicate that infection of human air ##way ep ##ith ##elia by sar ##s corona ##virus co ##rre ##lates with the state of cell differentiation and ace ##2 expression and local ##ization . these findings have implications for understanding disease pathogen ##esis associated with sar ##s - co ##v and nl ##6 ##3 infections .  
the membrane ( m ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a major g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein with multiple biological functions . in this study , we found that memory t cells against m protein were persistent in recovered sar ##s patients by detecting gamma inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - γ ) production using elisa and eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ays . flow cy ##tom ##et ##ric analysis showed that both cd ##4 ( + ) and cd ##8 ( + ) t cells were involved in cellular responses to sar ##s - co ##v m antigen . furthermore , memory cd ##8 ( + ) t cells displayed an effect ##or memory cell ph ##eno ##type expressing cd ##45 ##ro ( − ) cc ##r ##7 ( − ) cd ##6 ##2 ##l ( − ) . in contrast , the majority of if ##n - γ ( + ) cd ##4 ( + ) t cells were central memory cells with the expression of cd ##45 ##ro ( + ) cc ##r ##7 ( + ) cd ##6 ##2 ##l ( − ) . the ep ##ito ##pe screening from 30 synthetic overlapping peptide ##s that cover the entire sar ##s - co ##v m protein identified four human t - cell im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant peptide ##s , p ##21 ##− ##44 , p ##65 ##− ##9 ##1 , p ##11 ##7 ##−1 ##40 and p ##200 ##− ##22 ##0 . all four im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant peptide ##s could eli ##cit cellular immunity with a pre ##dom ##ina ##nce of cd ##8 ( + ) t - cell response . this data may have important implication for developing sar ##s vaccines .  
background / aims : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and mar ##burg virus ( mar ##v ) are among the world health organization ' s top 8 emerging pathogen ##s . both zoo ##nos ##es share non ##sp ##ec ##ific early symptoms , a high lethal ##ity rate , and a reduced number of specific treatment options . therefore , we evaluated extra ##corp ##ore ##al virus and g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( gp ) elimination by le ##ct ##in affinity plasma ##pher ##esis ( lap ) . methods : for both mer ##s - co ##v ( pseudo ##virus ) as well as mar ##v ( gps ) , 4 lap devices ( mini hem ##op ##uri ##fi ##ers , ae ##th ##lon medical , san diego , ca , usa ) and 4 negative controls were tested . samples were collected every 30 min and analyzed for reduction in virus in ##fect ##ivity by a flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry - based in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ay ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and in soluble gp content ( mar ##v ) by an im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y . results : the experiments show a time - dependent clearance of mer ##s - co ##v of up to 80 % within 3 h ( pseudo ##virus ) . up to 70 % of mar ##v - soluble gps were eliminated at the same time . substantial sat ##uration of the binding resin ##s was detected within the first treatment hour . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v ( pseudo ##virus ) and mar ##v soluble gps are eliminated by lap in vitro . considering the high lethal ##ity and missing established treatment options , lap should be evaluated in vivo . especially early initiation , continuous therapy , and timed cartridge exchanges could be of importance .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus termed sar ##s - co ##v . we and others have previously shown that the replication of sar ##s - co ##v can be suppressed by ex ##ogen ##ously added inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) , a cy ##tok ##ine which is normally synthesized by cells as a reaction to virus infection . here , we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v escapes if ##n - mediated growth inhibition by preventing the induction of if ##n - β . in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells , no end ##ogen ##ous if ##n - β transcript ##s and no if ##n - β promoter activity were detected . nevertheless , the transcription factor inter ##fer ##on regulatory factor 3 ( ir ##f - 3 ) , which is essential for if ##n - β promoter activity , was transported from the cy ##top ##las ##m to the nucleus early after infection with sar ##s - co ##v . however , at a later time point in infection , ir ##f - 3 was again localized in the cy ##top ##las ##m . by contrast , ir ##f - 3 remained in the nucleus of cells infected with the if ##n - inducing control virus bun ##yam ##wer ##a del ##ns ##s . other signs of ir ##f - 3 activation such as hyper ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation , homo ##dim ##er formation , and recruitment of the coa ##ct ##iva ##tor cr ##eb - binding protein ( cb ##p ) were found late after infection with the control virus but not with sar ##s - co ##v . our data suggest that nuclear transport of ir ##f - 3 is an immediate - early reaction to virus infection and may pre ##cede its hyper ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation , homo ##dim ##er formation , and binding to cb ##p . in order to escape activation of the if ##n system , sar ##s - co ##v appears to block a step after the early nuclear transport of ir ##f - 3 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s . it is believed that sar ##s - co ##v originates from wild animals . we have developed a multi ##tar ##get real - time ta ##q ##man reverse transcription - pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ay for the quantitative detection of sar ##s - co ##v . the sequences of the ta ##q ##man probe ##s with a minor groove bind ##er and the corresponding prime ##rs were based on the sequences of the n gene , open reading frame ( or ##f ) 3 , and or ##f 8 . the overall linear range of this ass ##ay was from at least 10 ( 1 ) to 10 ( 6 ) copies per reaction , and the detection limit could reach less than 10 copies per reaction . the quan ##ti ##fication results for sar ##s - co ##v from cell culture correlated well with those of the rt - pc ##r by using any two of the three sets of prime ##r and probe used in this ass ##ay . however , the results of quan ##ti ##fication of sar ##s - co ##v obtained by using a few available throat sw ##ab specimens from sar ##s patients and the n gene as the target were almost 10 times higher than those obtained by using or ##f 3 and or ##f 8 . using this ass ##ay , we also detected an apparently sar ##s - co ##v - related corona ##virus in the throat sw ##ab specimens from masked palm ci ##vet ##s in the west part of hub ##ei province , people ' s republic of china .  
in contrast with adults , children infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ corona virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) develop mild ##er clinical symptoms . because of this , it is speculated that children va ##cci ##nated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against sar ##s ‐ co ##v . anti ##ser ##a and t cells from mice im ##mun ##ised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross react ##ivity against sar ##s ‐ co ##v . the results showed no marked cross react ##ivity against sar ##s ‐ co ##v , which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by sar ##s ‐ co ##v may be caused by other factors .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes proteins required for rna transcription and genome replication as large poly ##pro ##tein ##s that are pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally processed by virus - encoded protein ##ase ##s to produce mature replica ##se proteins . in this report , we generated antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v predicted replica ##se protein and used the antibodies to identify and character ##ize 12 of the 16 predicted mature replica ##se proteins ( ns ##p ##1 , ns ##p ##2 , ns ##p ##3 , ns ##p ##4 , ns ##p ##5 , ns ##p ##8 , ns ##p ##9 , ns ##p ##12 , ns ##p ##13 , ns ##p ##14 , ns ##p ##15 , and ns ##p ##16 ) in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells . im ##mun ##ob ##lot analysis of infected - cell l ##ys ##ates identified proteins of the predicted sizes . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence microscopy detected similar patterns of pun ##cta ##te per ##in ##uc ##lea ##r and distributed cy ##top ##las ##mic f ##oc ##i with all replica ##se antibodies and as early as 6 h post ##in ##fect ##ion . dual - labeling studies demonstrated col ##oca ##lization of replica ##se protein ns ##p ##8 with ns ##p ##2 and ns ##p ##3 in cy ##top ##las ##mic complexes and also with lc ##3 , a protein marker for auto ##pha ##gic va ##cu ##oles . antibodies directed against mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) vi ##rion ##s and against the put ##ative rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( pol ) detected sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and ns ##p ##12 ( pol ) , respectively , in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells . these results confirm the predicted protein processing pattern for mature sar ##s - co ##v replica ##se proteins , demonstrate local ##ization of replica ##se proteins to cy ##top ##las ##mic complexes containing markers for auto ##pha ##gos ##ome membranes , and suggest conservation of protein ep ##ito ##pes in the replica ##se and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id of sar ##s - co ##v and the group ii corona ##virus , m ##h ##v . further , the results demonstrate the ability of replica ##se antibodies to detect sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells as early as 6 h post ##in ##fect ##ion and thus represent important tools for studies of sar ##s - co ##v replication , inhibition , and diagnosis .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe disease in human . mer ##s - co ##v is closely related to bat corona ##virus ##es hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 . eva ##sion of the innate anti ##vira ##l response might contribute significantly to mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis , but the mechanism is poorly understood . in this study , we characterized mer ##s - co ##v 4a protein as a novel im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive factor that ant ##ago ##ni ##zes type i inter ##fer ##on production . mer ##s - co ##v 4a protein contains a double - stranded rna - binding domain capable of interacting with poly ( i · c ) . expression of mer ##s - co ##v 4a protein suppressed the inter ##fer ##on production induced by poly ( i · c ) or send ##ai virus . rna binding of mer ##s - co ##v 4a protein was required for if ##n ant ##ago ##nism , a property shared by 4a protein of bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##5 but not by the counterpart in bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##4 . mer ##s - co ##v 4a protein interact ##ed with pact in an rna - dependent manner but not with rig - i or md ##a ##5 . it inhibit ##ed pact - induced activation of rig - i and md ##a ##5 but did not affect the activity of downstream effect ##ors such as rig - i , md ##a ##5 , ma ##vs , tb ##k ##1 , and ir ##f ##3 . taken together , our findings suggest a new mechanism through which mer ##s - co ##v employs a viral double - stranded rna - binding protein to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the innate anti ##vira ##l response by per ##tur ##bing the function of cellular double - stranded rna - binding protein pact . pact targeting might be a common strategy used by different viruses , including e ##bola virus and her ##pes simple ##x virus 1 , to counter ##act innate immunity . importance middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging and highly lethal human pathogen . why mer ##s - co ##v causes severe disease in human is unclear , and one possibility is that mer ##s - co ##v is particularly efficient in counter ##act ##ing host immunity , including the sensing of virus invasion . it will therefore be critical to clarify how mer ##s - co ##v cr ##ip ##ples the host proteins that sense viruses and to compare mer ##s - co ##v with its ancestral viruses in bats in the counter ##act ##ion of virus sensing . this work not only provides a new understanding of the abilities of mer ##s - co ##v and closely related bat viruses to sub ##vert virus sensing but also might prove useful in revealing new strategies
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging human pathogen that is the ca ##usa ##tive agent for middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . with mer ##s outbreak ##s resulting in over 35 % fatalities and now spread to 27 countries , mer ##s - co ##v poses a significant ongoing threat to global human health . as part of its viral genome , mer ##s - co ##v en ##codes a papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) that has been observed to act as a de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inas ##e and dei ##sg ##yla ##se to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - i ) immune pathways . this activity is in addition to its viral poly ##pe ##pt ##ide cleavage function . although the overall impact of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro function is observed to be essential , difficulty has been encountered in del ##ine ##ating the importance of its separate functions , particularly its dei ##sg ##yla ##se activity . as a result , the interface of mer ##s - co ##v and human inter ##fer ##on - stimulated gene product 15 ( his ##g ##15 ) was probe ##d with iso ##thermal cal ##ori ##metry , which suggests that the c - terminal domain of his ##g ##15 is principally responsible for interactions . subsequently , the structure of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro was solved to 2 . 4 a in complex with the c - terminal domain of his ##g ##15 . utilizing this structural information , mutants were generated that lacked app ##re ##cia ##ble dei ##sg ##yla ##se activity but retained wild - type de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inas ##e and peptide cleavage activities . hence , this provides a new platform for understanding viral dei ##sg ##yla ##se activity within mer ##s - co ##v and other co ##vs . importance corona ##virus ##es , such as middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , en ##code a papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) that possesses the ability to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze inter ##fer ##on immune pathways through the removal of u ##bi ##qui ##tin and inter ##fer ##on - stimulated gene product 15 ( is ##g ##15 ) from target proteins . the lack of co ##v pro ##tea ##ses with at ##ten ##uated dei ##sg ##yla ##se activity has been a key obstacle in del ##ine ##ating the impact between de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inas ##e and dei ##sg ##yla ##se activities on viral host eva ##sion and pathogen ##esis . here , bio ##physical techniques revealed that mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro chiefly engages human is ##g ##15 through its c - terminal domain . the first structure of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro in complex with this domain exposed the interface between these two
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is not efficiently transmitted between humans , but it is highly prevalent in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . here we report that the mer ##s - co ##v receptor — dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) — is expressed in the upper respiratory tract ep ##ith ##eli ##um of camel ##s but not in that of humans . lack of d ##pp ##4 expression may be the primary cause of limited mer ##s - co ##v replication in the human upper respiratory tract and hence restrict transmission .  
in this study we assessed the ability of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) to replicate and induce innate immunity in human mono ##cy ##te - derived macro ##pha ##ges and den ##dr ##itic cells ( md ##dc ##s ) , and compared it with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . assessments of viral protein and rna levels in infected cells showed that both viruses were impaired in their ability to replicate in these cells . some induction of if ##n - λ ##1 , c ##x ##cl ##10 and mx ##a mrna ##s in both macro ##pha ##ges and md ##dc ##s was seen in response to mer ##s - co ##v infection , but almost no such induction was observed in response to sar ##s - co ##v infection . elisa and western b ##lot ass ##ays showed clear production of c ##x ##cl ##10 and mx ##a in mer ##s - co ##v - infected macro ##pha ##ges and md ##dc ##s . our data suggest that sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v replicate poorly in human macro ##pha ##ges and md ##dc ##s , but mer ##s - co ##v is nonetheless capable of inducing a readily detect ##able host innate immune response . our results highlight a clear difference between the viruses in act ##ivating host innate immune responses in macro ##pha ##ges and md ##dc ##s , which may contribute to the pathogen ##esis of infection .  
before the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2003 , only 12 other animal or human corona ##virus ##es were known . the discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the ci ##vet and bat sar ##s - co ##v and the human corona ##virus ##es nl ##6 ##3 and hk ##u ##1 . surveillance of corona ##virus ##es in many animal species has increased the number on the list of corona ##virus ##es to at least 36 . the explosive nature of the first sar ##s epidemic , the high mortality , its transient re ##eme ##rgen ##ce a year later , and economic disruption ##s led to a rush on research of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical , path ##ological , im ##mun ##ological , vi ##rol ##ogical , and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease . this research resulted in over 4 , 000 publications , only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article . the marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests , animal models , anti ##vira ##ls , vaccines , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and infection control measures , which could prove to be useful in random ##ized control trials if sar ##s should return . the findings that horseshoe bats are the natural reservoir for sar ##s - co ##v - like virus and that ci ##vet ##s are the amp ##li ##fication host highlight the importance of wildlife and bio ##se ##cu ##rity in farms and wet markets , which can serve as the source and amp ##li ##fication centers for emerging infections .  
pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cause acute respiratory illness . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data from the 2002 - 2003 sar ##s epidemic and recent mer ##s indicate that there may be sex - dependent differences in disease outcomes . to investigate these differences , we infected male and female mice of different age groups with sar ##s - co ##v and analyzed their su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to the infection . our results showed that male mice were more susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v infection compared to age matched females . the degree of sex - bias to sar ##s - co ##v infection increased with advancing age such that middle - aged mice showed much more pronounced differences compared to young mice . enhanced su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of male mice to sar ##s - co ##v was associated with elevated virus ti ##ters , enhanced vascular leak ##age and al ##ve ##olar ed ##ema . these changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory mono ##cy ##te macro ##pha ##ges ( im ##ms ) and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s in the lungs of male mice and de ##ple ##tion of im ##ms partially protected these mice from lethal sar ##s . moreover , the sex - specific differences were independent of t and b cell responses . furthermore , o ##var ##iec ##tom ##y or treating female mice with an est ##rogen receptor antagonist increased mortality indicating a protective effect for est ##rogen receptor signaling in mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v . together , these data suggest that sex differences in su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v in mice parallel those observed in patients and also identify est ##rogen receptor signaling as critical for protection in females .  
the spike ( s ) protein of the recently emerged human middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) media ##tes infection by binding to the cellular receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . here we mapped the receptor binding domain in the s protein to a 231 - amino - acid fragment ( residues 35 ##8 to 58 ##8 ) by evaluating the interaction of spike tr ##un ##cation variants with receptor - expressing cells and soluble d ##pp ##4 . antibodies to this domain — much less so those to the preceding n - terminal region — efficiently neutral ##ize mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
we identified the domains of cd ##26 involved in the binding of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) using distinct clones of anti - cd ##26 mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) . one clone , named 2 ##f ##9 , almost completely inhibit ##ed viral entry . the human ##ized anti - cd ##26 mab y ##s ##11 ##0 also significantly inhibit ##ed infection . these findings indicate that both 2 ##f ##9 and y ##s ##11 ##0 are potential therapeutic agents for mer ##s - co ##v infection . y ##s ##11 ##0 , in particular , is a good candidate for immediate testing as a therapeutic mod ##ality for mer ##s .  
middle east respiratory syndrome – corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) - - is a novel corona ##virus that has caused a number of community - acquired cases and health care associated outbreak ##s in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates ( uae ) as well as sporadic cases in other countries , especially in the middle east . the evidence to date links mer ##s - co ##v cases with exposure to camel ##s , including camel products or to probable or confirmed human cases of mer ##s - co ##v . it typically presents as an acute respiratory illness and is associated with a 35 % mortality rate . based on available information at this time , the current risk to canadians for acquiring mer ##s - co ##v infections is considered low . however , the international health regulations committee concerning mer ##s - co ##v has caution ##ed that the ups ##urg ##e of cases seen this past spring ( 2014 ) may be predict ##ive of an increase in cases related to the ha ##j ##j – an annual pilgrimage to mecca in saudi arabia that took place in early october 2014 . although the overall risk is low , the public health agency of canada and its national micro ##biology laboratory ( nm ##l ) in close collaboration with provincial and territorial partners , the canadian public health laboratory network ( cp ##hl ##n ) and infection prevention and control experts have developed a number of prepared ##ness guidance documents and protocols to address the risk of an imported case of mer ##s - co ##v in canada .  
u ##bi ##qui ##tin ( u ##b ) and the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like mod ##ifier inter ##fer ##on stimulated gene 15 ( is ##g ##15 ) participate in the host defense of viral infections . viruses , including the severe acute respiratory syndrome human corona ##virus ( sar ##s hc ##ov ) , have co - opted u ##b / is ##g ##15 - con ##ju ##gation pathways for their own advantage or have evolved effect ##or proteins to counter pro - inflammatory properties of u ##b / is ##g ##15 - con ##ju ##gated host proteins . here , we compare substrate specific ##ities of the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) from the recently emerged middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) hc ##ov to the related pro ##tea ##se from sar ##s , sar ##s pl ##pro . through bio ##chemical ass ##ays , we show that similar to sar ##s pl ##pro , mer ##s pl ##pro is both a de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating and a dei ##sg ##yla ##ting enzyme . further analysis of the intrinsic de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##inating enzyme ( dub ) activity of these viral pro ##tea ##ses revealed unique differences between the recognition and cleavage specific ##ities of poly ##ub chains . first , mer ##s pl ##pro shows broad link ##age specific ##ity for the cleavage of poly ##ub chains , while sar ##s pl ##pro prefers to cl ##ea ##ve l ##ys ##48 - linked poly ##ub chains . second , mer ##s pl ##pro cl ##ea ##ves poly ##ub chains in a “ mono - di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tive ” manner ( one u ##b at a time ) , and sar ##s pl ##pro prefers to cl ##ea ##ve k ##48 - linked poly - u ##b chains by sensing a di - u ##b moi ##ety as a minimal recognition element using a “ di - di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tive ” cleavage mechanism . the di - di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tive cleavage mechanism for sar ##s pl ##pro appears to be uncommon among us ##p - family dub ##s , as related us ##p family members from humans do not display such a mechanism . we propose that these intrinsic en ##zy ##matic differences between sar ##s and mer ##s pl ##pro will help identify pro - inflammatory substrates of these viral dub ##s and can guide in the design of therapeutic ##s to combat infection by corona ##virus ##es .  
one of the most striking and dramatic gen ##omic changes observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) isolated from humans soon after its zoo ##not ##ic transmission from palm ci ##vet ##s was the acquisition of a characteristic 29 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on . this occurred in open reading frame 8 ( or ##f ##8 ) , one of the accessory genes unique to the sar ##s - co ##v . the function of or ##f ##8 and the significance of the del ##eti ##on are unknown . the intact or ##f ##8 present in animal and some early human isolate ##s en ##codes a 122 - amino - acid poly ##pe ##pt ##ide ( 8 ##ab ( + ) ) , which we expressed in cells using the va ##cci ##nia virus t ##7 expression system . it was found to contain a cl ##ea ##vable signal sequence , which directs the precursor to the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) and media ##tes its trans ##lo ##cation into the lu ##men . the cl ##ea ##ved protein became n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted , assembled into di ##sul ##fide - linked homo ##mu ##lt ##ime ##ric complexes , and remained stab ##ly in the er . the 29 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on splits or ##f ##8 into two or ##fs , 8 ##a and 8 ##b , encoding 39 - and 84 - residue poly ##pe ##pt ##ides . the 8 ##a poly ##pe ##pt ##ide is likely to remain in the cy ##top ##las ##m , as it is too small for its signal sequence to function and will therefore be directly released from the rib ##oso ##me . however , we could not confirm this experimental ##ly due to the lack of proper antibodies . or ##f ##8 ##b appeared not to be expressed in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells or when expressed from mrna ' s mimic ##king mrna ##8 . this was due to the context of the internal aug initiation cod ##on , as we demonstrated after placing the or ##f ##8 ##b immediately behind the t ##7 promoter . a soluble , un ##mo ##di ##fied and mono ##meric 8 ##b protein was now expressed in the cy ##top ##las ##m , which was highly unstable and rapidly degraded . clearly , the 29 - nu ##cle ##otide del ##eti ##on disrupt ##s the proper expression of the sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##8 , the implications of which are discussed .  
a new corona ##virus ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus [ sar ##s - co ##v ] ) has been identified to be the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome . given the highly con ##tag ##ious and acute nature of the disease , there is an urgent need for the development of diagnostic ass ##ays that can detect sar ##s - co ##v infection . for determination of which of the viral proteins encoded by the sar ##s - co ##v genome may be exploited as diagnostic antigen ##s for ser ##ological ass ##ays , the viral proteins were expressed individually in mammalian and / or bacterial cells and tested for react ##ivity with sera from sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients by western b ##lot analysis . a total of 81 sera , including 67 from con ##vale ##scent patients and seven pairs from two time points of infection , were analyzed , and all showed im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity towards the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) . sera from some of the patients also showed im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity to u2 ##7 ##4 ( 59 of 81 [ 73 % ] ) , a protein that is unique to sar ##s - co ##v . in addition , all of the con ##vale ##scent - phase sera showed im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity to the spike ( s ) protein when analyzed by an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence method utilizing mammalian cells stab ##ly expressing s . however , samples from the acute phase ( 2 to 9 days after the onset of illness ) did not react with s , suggesting that antibodies to n may appear earlier than antibodies to s . alternatively , this could be due to the difference in the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of the two methods . the im ##mun ##ore ##act ##iv ##ities to these rec ##om ##bina ##nt viral proteins are highly specific , as sera from 100 healthy donors did not react with any of them . these results suggest that rec ##om ##bina ##nt n , s , and u2 ##7 ##4 proteins may be used as antigen ##s for the development of ser ##ological ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v .  
the expression of the gen ##omic information of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) involves synthesis of a nest ##ed set of sub ##gen ##omic rna ##s ( sg ##rna ##s ) by disco ##nti ##nu ##ous transcription . in sar ##s co ##v - infected cells , 10 sg ##rna ##s , including 2 novel ones , were identified , which were predicted to be functional in the expression of 12 open reading frames located in the 3 ′ one - third of the genome . surprisingly , one new sg ##rna could lead to production of a truncated spike protein . sequence analysis of the leader - body fusion sites of each sg ##rna showed that the junction sequences and the corresponding transcription - regulatory sequence ( tr ##s ) are unique for each species of sg ##rna and are consistent after virus passages . for the two novel sg ##rna ##s , each used a variant of the tr ##s that has one nu ##cle ##otide mis ##mat ##ch in the conserved he ##xa ##nu ##cle ##otide core ( ac ##ga ##ac ) in the tr ##s . coe ##xi ##sten ##ce of both plus and minus strands of sar ##s co ##v sg ##rna ##s and evidence for derivation of the sg ##rna core sequence from the body core sequence favor the model of disco ##nti ##nu ##ous transcription during minus - strand synthesis . moreover , one rare species of sg ##rna has the junction sequence aaa , indicating that its transcription could result from a non ##cano ##nical transcription signal . taken together , these results provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms of genome expression and sub ##gen ##omic transcription of sar ##s co ##v .  
the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak resulted in calls for an accurate diagnostic test that can be used not only for routine testing but also for generating nu ##cle ##otide sequences to monitor the epidemic . although the identity of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome was confirmed by dna sequencing , it is imp ##rac ##tical to sequence the entire 29 - kb sar ##s - co ##v genome on a routine basis . therefore , alternative ass ##ay methods such as the enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay and pc ##r have been pursued for routine testing , primarily to resolve probable cases . we report here a modification of standard dna sequencing technology for accurate identification of sar ##s - co ##v in routine testing . instead of requiring the sequencing of the whole sar ##s - co ##v genome , our modification enables the simultaneous sequencing of three regions of the sar ##s - co ##v genome , the spike protein - encoding gene ( 35 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) , gene m ( 43 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) , and gene n ( 45 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) , in a single electro ##pher ##og ##ram . comparing these nu ##cle ##otide sequences to dna data ##bank entries ( national institutes of health ) con ##clusive ##ly identified them as sar ##s - co ##v sequences .  
the corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v is the primary cause of the life - threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . with the aim of developing therapeutic agents , we have tested peptide ##s derived from the membrane - pro ##xi ##mal ( hr ##2 ) and membrane - distal ( hr ##1 ) he ##pta ##d repeat region of the spike protein as inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v infection of ve ##ro cells . it appeared that hr ##2 peptide ##s , but not hr ##1 peptide ##s , were inhibitor ##y . their efficacy was , however , significantly lower than that of corresponding hr ##2 peptide ##s of the mu ##rine corona ##virus mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) in inhibit ##ing m ##h ##v infection . bio ##chemical and electron microscopic ##al analyses showed that , when mixed , sar ##s - co ##v hr ##1 and hr ##2 peptide ##s assemble into a six - helix bundle consisting of hr ##1 as a central triple - stranded coiled coil in association with three hr ##2 α - he ##lices oriented in an anti ##para ##lle ##l manner . the stability of this complex , as measured by its resistance to heat di ##sso ##ciation , appeared to be much lower than that of the corresponding m ##h ##v complex , which may explain the different inhibitor ##y pot ##encies of the hr ##2 peptide ##s . analogous to other class i viral fusion proteins , the six - helix complex supposedly represents a post ##fusion conform ##ation that is formed after insertion of the fusion peptide , proposed here for corona ##virus ##es to be located immediately upstream of hr ##1 , into the target membrane . the resulting close app ##osition of fusion peptide and spike trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain facilitates membrane fusion . the inhibitor ##y pot ##ency of the sar ##s - co ##v hr ##2 - peptide ##s provides an attractive basis for the development of a therapeutic drug for sar ##s .  
infection of receptor - bearing cells by corona ##virus ##es is mediated by their spike ( s ) proteins . the corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in ##fect ##s cells expressing the receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . here we show that cod ##on optimization of the sar ##s - co ##v s - protein gene substantially enhanced s - protein expression . we also found that two retro ##virus ##es , simi ##an im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( si ##v ) and mu ##rine leukemia virus , both expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v s protein or s - protein variants , efficiently infected he ##k ##29 ##3 ##t cells stab ##ly expressing ace ##2 . infection mediated by an s - protein variant whose cy ##top ##las ##mic domain had been truncated and altered to include a fragment of the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of the human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus type 1 envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was , in both cases , substantially more efficient than that mediated by wild - type s protein . using s - protein - pseudo ##type ##d si ##v , we found that the en ##zy ##matic activity of ace ##2 made no contribution to s - protein - mediated infection . finally , we show that a soluble and catalytic ##ally inactive form of ace ##2 potent ##ly blocked infection by s - protein - pseudo ##type ##d retro ##virus and by sar ##s - co ##v . these results permit studies of sar ##s - co ##v entry inhibitors without the use of live virus and suggest a candidate therapy for sar ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes several accessory proteins of unknown function . one of these proteins , protein 6 ( p ##6 ) , which is encoded by or ##f ##6 , enhance ##s virus replication when introduced into a het ##ero ##log ##ous mu ##rine corona ##virus ( mouse hepatitis virus [ m ##h ##v ] ) but is not essential for optimal sar ##s - co ##v replication after infection at a relatively high multi ##plicity of infection ( moi ) . here , we reconcile these apparently conflicting results by showing that p ##6 enhance ##s sar ##s - co ##v replication to nearly the same extent as when expressed in the context of m ##h ##v if cells are infected at a low moi and accelerate ##s disease in mice trans ##genic for the human sar ##s - co ##v receptor .  
the identification of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 re ##af ##firmed the importance of understanding how corona ##virus ##es emerge , in ##fect , and cause disease . by comparing what is known about severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) to what has recently been found for mer ##s - co ##v , researchers are discovering similarities and differences that may be important for pathogen ##esis . here we discuss what is known about each virus and what gaps remain in our understanding , especially concerning mer ##s - co ##v .  
the penetration of various viruses into host cells is accomplished by hi ##jack ##ing the host end ##oc ##yt ##osis machinery . in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection , viral entry is reported to require a low ph in intra ##cy ##top ##las ##mic ve ##sic ##les ; however , little is known about how sar ##s - co ##v invade ##s such compartments . here we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v mainly utilizes the cl ##ath ##rin - mediated end ##oc ##yt ##osis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious sar ##s - co ##v , as well as a sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus packaged in the sar ##s - co ##v envelope . the sar ##s - co ##v entered cave ##olin - 1 - negative he ##pg ##2 cells , and the entry was significantly inhibit ##ed by treatment with ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine , an inhibitor for cl ##ath ##rin - dependent end ##oc ##yt ##osis , and by small interfering rna - mediated gene si ##len ##cing for the cl ##ath ##rin heavy chain . furthermore , the sar ##s - co ##v entered co ##s ##7 cells trans ##fect ##ed with the mutant of ace ##2 with the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail deleted , sar ##s - co ##v receptor , as well as the wild - type ace ##2 , and their entries were significantly inhibit ##ed by treatment with ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine . in addition , ace ##2 trans ##lo ##cated into ee ##a1 - positive early end ##oso ##mes immediately after the virus attachment to ace ##2 . these results suggest that when sar ##s - co ##v binds ace ##2 it is internal ##ized and penetrate ##s early end ##oso ##mes in a cl ##ath ##rin - dependent manner and that the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of ace ##2 is not required for the penetration of sar ##s - co ##v .  
the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) contains eight open reading frames ( or ##fs ) that en ##code novel proteins . these accessory proteins are di ##sp ##ens ##able for in vitro and in vivo replication and thus may be important for other aspects of virus - host interactions . we investigated the functions of the largest of the accessory proteins , the or ##f 3a protein , using a 3a - def ##icient strain of sar ##s - co ##v . cell death of ve ##ro cells after infection with sar ##s - co ##v was reduced upon del ##eti ##on of or ##f 3a . electron microscopy of infected cells revealed a role for or ##f 3a in sar ##s - co ##v induced ve ##sic ##le formation , a prominent feature of cells from sar ##s patients . in addition , we report that or ##f 3a is both necessary and sufficient for sar ##s - co ##v - induced go ##l ##gi fragmentation and that the 3a protein accumulate ##s and local ##izes to ve ##sic ##les containing markers for late end ##oso ##mes . finally , over ##ex ##press ##ion of ad ##p - rib ##os ##yla ##tion factor 1 ( ar ##f ##1 ) , a small gt ##pas ##e essential for the maintenance of the go ##l ##gi apparatus , restored go ##l ##gi morphology during infection . these results establish an important role for or ##f 3a in sar ##s - co ##v - induced cell death , go ##l ##gi fragmentation , and the accumulation of intra ##cellular ve ##sic ##les .  
viruses employ different strategies to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the anti ##vira ##l actions of the innate immune response . sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a virus that causes severe lung damage , en ##codes an array of proteins able to inhibit induction and signaling of type - i inter ##fer ##ons . however , recent studies have demonstrated that inter ##fer ##ons are produced during sar ##s - co ##v infection in humans and mac ##aq ##ues . furthermore , nuclear trans ##lo ##cation of activated stat ##1 and a range of inter ##fer ##on - stimulated genes could be demonstrated in the lungs of sar ##s - co ##v - infected mac ##aq ##ues . in line with these observations , plasma ##cy ##to ##id den ##dr ##itic cells have been shown to produce inter ##fer ##ons upon sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . given the pivotal role of inter ##fer ##ons during viral infections , ( differential ) induction of inter ##fer ##ons may affect the outcome of the infection . therefore , the functional implication of inter ##fer ##on production during sar ##s - co ##v infection remains to be re - investigated .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in ##fect ##s humans from zoo ##not ##ic sources and causes severe pulmonary disease . vi ##rion ##s require spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s for binding to cell receptors and for cat ##aly ##zing virus – cell membrane fusion . fusion occurs only after s proteins are cl ##ea ##ved sequential ##ly , first during their secret ##ion through the ex ##oc ##ytic organ ##elles of virus - producing cells , and second after virus binding to target - cell receptors . to more precisely determine how sequential pro ##te ##ol ##ysis contributes to co ##v infection , we introduced s mutations ob ##st ##ru ##cting the first cleavage ##s . these mutations severely compromised mer ##s - co ##v infection into human lung - derived cells , but had little effect on infection into several other cell types . these cell type - specific requirements for pro ##te ##ol ##ysis correlated with s conform ##ations during cell entry . without the first cleavage ##s , s proteins resisted cell receptor - induced conform ##ation ##al changes , which restricted the second , fusion - act ##ivating cleavage ##s . consistent with these findings , pre ##cle ##ave ##d mer ##s viruses used receptor - pro ##xi ##mal , cell - surface pro ##tea ##ses to effect the second fusion - act ##ivating cleavage ##s during cell entry , whereas the more rigid uncle ##ave ##d mer ##s viruses traffic ##ked past these cell - surface pro ##tea ##ses and into end ##oso ##mes . uncle ##ave ##d viruses were less infectious to human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial and cal ##u ##3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient end ##osomal fusion - act ##ivating pro ##tea ##ses . thus , by sen ##sit ##izing viruses to receptor - induced conform ##ation ##al changes , the first s cleavage ##s expand virus tr ##op ##ism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection , and therefore may be significant deter ##mina ##nts of mer ##s - co ##v vi ##ru ##lence .  
the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - pro ##tea ##some system ( ups ) is involved in the replication of a broad range of viruses . since replication of the mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) is impaired upon pro ##tea ##som ##al inhibition , the relevance of the ups for the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was investigated in this study . we demonstrate that the pro ##tea ##som ##al inhibitor mg ##13 ##2 strongly inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v replication by interfering with early steps of the viral life cycle . surprisingly , other pro ##tea ##som ##al inhibitors ( e . g . , lac ##ta ##cy ##sti ##n and bo ##rte ##zo ##mi ##b ) only marginal ##ly affected viral replication , indicating that the effect of mg ##13 ##2 is independent of pro ##tea ##som ##al impairment . induction of auto ##pha ##gy by mg ##13 ##2 treatment was excluded from playing a role , and no changes in sar ##s - co ##v ti ##ters were observed during infection of wild - type or auto ##pha ##gy - def ##icient at ##g ##5 ( − / − ) mouse embryo ##nic fi ##bro ##bla ##sts over ##ex ##pressing the human sar ##s - co ##v receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . since mg ##13 ##2 also inhibit ##s the cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se m - cal ##pa ##in , we addressed the role of cal ##pa ##ins in the early sar ##s - co ##v life cycle using cal ##pa ##in inhibitors iii ( md ##l ##28 ##17 ##0 ) and vi ( s ##ja ##60 ##17 ) . in fact , m - cal ##pa ##in inhibition with md ##l ##28 ##17 ##0 resulted in an even more pronounced inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v replication ( > 7 orders of magnitude ) than did mg ##13 ##2 . additional m - cal ##pa ##in knock ##down experiments confirmed the dependence of sar ##s - co ##v replication on the activity of the cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se m - cal ##pa ##in . taken together , we provide strong experimental evidence that sar ##s - co ##v has unique replication requirements which are independent of functional ups or auto ##pha ##gy pathways compared to other corona ##virus ##es . additionally , this work highlights an important role for m - cal ##pa ##in during early steps of the sar ##s - co ##v life cycle .  
in march 2003 , a novel corona ##virus was isolated from patients exhibiting at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , and was subsequently proven to be the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the disease now referred to as sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) . the complete genome of the sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s corona ##virus ) has since been sequence ##d . the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( sar ##s - co ##v n ) protein shares little homo ##logy with other members of the corona ##virus family . in the present paper , we show that sar ##s - co ##v n is capable of inducing ap ##op ##tosis of co ##s - 1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by down - regulating er ##k ( extra ##cellular - signal - regulated kinase ) , up - regulating j ##nk ( c - jun n - terminal kinase ) and p ##38 map ##k ( mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ) pathways , and affecting their downstream effect ##ors . sar ##s - co ##v n expression also down - regulated ph ##os ##ph ##o - ak ##t and bc ##l - 2 levels , and activated cas ##pas ##es 3 and 7 . however , ap ##op ##tosis was independent of the p ##53 and fa ##s signalling pathways . furthermore , activation of the p ##38 map ##k pathway was found to induce act ##in reorganization in cells devoid of growth factors . at the cy ##tos ##kel ##eta ##l level , sar ##s - co ##v n down - regulated fa ##k ( focal ad ##hesion kinase ) activity and also down - regulated fi ##bron ##ect ##in expression . this is the first report showing the ability of the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v to induce ap ##op ##tosis and act ##in reorganization in mammalian cells under stressed conditions .  
a decade ago , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused a global pan ##de ##mic with a mortality rate of 10 % . reports of recent outbreak ##s of a sar ##s - like disease caused by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have raised serious concerns of a possible re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of sar ##s - co ##v , either by laboratory escape or the presence of a natural reservoir . therefore , the development of effective and safe sar ##s vaccines is still needed . based on our previous studies , we believe that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s ##1 subunit of the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is the most important target for developing a sar ##s vaccine . in particular , rb ##d of s protein contains the critical neutral ##izing domain ( cn ##d ) , which is able to induce highly potent neutral ##izing antibody response and cross - protection against diver ##gent sar ##s - co ##v strains . furthermore , a rb ##d - based subunit vaccine is expected to be safer than other vaccines that may induce th ##2 - type im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . this review will discuss key advances in the development of rb ##d - based sar ##s vaccines and the possibility of using a similar strategy to develop vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging pathogen with the potential to pose a threat to global public health . sporadic cases and outbreak ##s continue to be reported in the middle east , and case fatal ##ity rates remain high at approximately 36 % globally . no specific prevent ##ive or therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures currently exist . a safe and effective vaccine could play an important role in protecting against the threat from mer ##s - co ##v . this review discusses human vaccine candidates currently under development , and explores viral characteristics , molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and im ##mun ##ology relevant to mer ##s - co ##v vaccine development . at present , a dna vaccine candidate has begun a human clinical trial , while two vector - based candidates will very soon begin human trials . protein - based vaccines are still at pre - clinical stage . challenges to successful development include incomplete understanding of viral transmission , pathogen ##esis and immune response ( in particular at the mu ##cos ##al level ) , no optimal animal challenge models , lack of standardized im ##mun ##ological ass ##ays , and insufficient sustainable funding .  
por ##cine hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ing en ##ce ##pha ##lom ##ye ##lit ##is ( ph ##e ) is caused by the corona ##virus hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ing en ##ce ##pha ##lom ##ye ##lit ##is virus ( ph ##e - co ##v ) , and the recent , rapid spread of ph ##e - co ##v in pig ##lets from many countries emphasizes the urgent need for a ph ##e - co ##v vaccine . here we use a mu ##rine model for evaluation of the induction of humor ##al and cellular immune responses by inactivated and ph ##e - co ##v dna vaccines in order to define the immune co ##rre ##lates for protection against ph ##e - co ##v . the inactivated vaccine was composed of pu ##rified ph ##e - co ##v and aluminum hydro ##xide gel ( al ##um ) , which was chosen as an ad ##ju ##vant because of its long history of safety for human use . the ph ##e - co ##v dna vaccine was constructed by sub ##cl ##oning the s ##1 gene of ph ##e - co ##v into the pv ##ax ##1 vector to create the rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d pv - s ##1 . our results showed that the inactivated ph ##e - co ##v vaccine ( ip ##v ) eli ##cite ##d a high level of humor ##al immunity , resulting in good protection efficacy against ph ##e - co ##v challenge . the ip ##v induced the i ##gg ##1 sub ##class of serum antibodies and expression of the cy ##tok ##ine inter ##le ##uki ##n - 4 ( il - 4 ) , suggesting that the ip ##v generated a predominantly th ##2 - type immune response . the dna vaccine was found to media ##te primarily a cellular immune response with high levels of i ##gg ##2 ##a and the cy ##tok ##ines il - 2 and gamma inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - γ ) . however , mice that were va ##cci ##nated twice with the dna vaccine and boosted with the ip ##v could mount a sufficient neutral ##izing antibody response against live ph ##e - co ##v , with little variation in i ##gg ##1 and i ##gg ##2 ##a levels , and showed high levels of il - 2 and il - 4 . this response may activate both b and t cells to mount a specific humor ##al and cellular immune response that could , in turn , eli ##cit a ph ##ago ##cy ##te - mediated defense against ph ##e - co ##v infections to achieve viral clearance .  
in 2002 , severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in humans , causing a global epidemic . by phylogenetic analysis , sar ##s - co ##v is distinct from known co ##vs and most closely related to group 2 co ##vs . however , no antigen ##ic cross - react ##ivity between sar ##s - co ##v and known co ##vs was con ##clusive ##ly and consistently demonstrated except for group 1 animal co ##vs . we analyzed this cross - react ##ivity by an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) and western b ##lot analysis using specific anti ##ser ##a to animal co ##vs and sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s patient con ##vale ##scent - phase or negative sera . moderate two - way cross - react ##ivity between sar ##s - co ##v and por ##cine co ##vs ( trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis co ##v [ t ##ge ##v ] and por ##cine respiratory co ##v [ prc ##v ] ) was mediated through the n but not the spike protein , whereas weaker cross - react ##ivity occurred with fe ##line ( fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ) and canine co ##vs . using es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli - expressed rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v n protein and fragments , the cross - reactive region was localized between amino acids ( aa ) 120 to 208 . the n - protein fragments comprising aa 360 to 412 and aa 1 to 213 reacted specifically with sar ##s con ##vale ##scent - phase sera but not with negative human sera in elisa ; the fragment comprising aa 1 to 213 cross - reacted with anti ##ser ##a to animal co ##vs , whereas the fragment comprising aa 360 to 412 did not cross - react and could be a potential candidate for sar ##s diagnosis . particularly noteworthy , a single substitution at aa 120 of prc ##v n protein diminished the cross - react ##ivity . we also demonstrated that the cross - react ##ivity is not universal for all group 1 co ##vs , because hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 did not cross - react with sar ##s - co ##v . one - way cross - react ##ivity of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 with group 1 co ##vs was localized to aa 1 to 39 and at least one other antigen ##ic site in the n - protein c terminus , differing from the cross - reactive region identified in sar ##s - co ##v n protein . the observed cross - react ##ivity is not a consequence of a higher level of amino acid identity between sar ##s - co ##v and por ##cine co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ##s , because sequence comparisons indicated that sar ##s - co ##v n protein has amino acid identity similar to that
we report the evaluation of rec ##om ##bina ##nt severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) - based antibody tests for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia and compare the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities and specific ##ities of this elisa for detection of im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) , i ##gm , i ##ga , and their combinations with serum samples from 149 healthy blood donors who donated blood 3 years ago as controls and 106 sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia patients in hong kong . the specific ##ities of the elisa for i ##gg , i ##gm , and i ##ga detection were 95 . 3 , 96 . 6 , and 96 . 6 % , respectively , with corresponding sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 94 . 3 , 59 . 4 , and 60 . 4 % , respectively . the present elisa appears to be a sensitive test for ser ##od ##ia ##gno ##sis of sar ##s - co ##v pneumonia , is much more economical and less labor - intensive than the indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay , and does not require cultivation of sar ##s - co ##v .  
a d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated innate immune response and ex ##uber ##ant cy ##tok ##ine / che ##mo ##kin ##e expression are believed to be critical factors in the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by a corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . however , we recently showed that in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt immune activation and a poor virus - specific t cell response under ##lie severe disease in sar ##s - co ##v - infected mice . here , we extend these results to show that virus - specific t cells , in the absence of activation of the innate immune response , were sufficient to significantly enhance survival and dim ##ini ##sh clinical disease . we demonstrated that t cells are responsible for virus clearance , as intra ##ven ##ous adoptive transfer of sar ##s - co ##v - immune sp ##len ##ocytes or in vitro - generated t cells to sci ##d or bal ##b / c mice enhanced survival and reduced virus ti ##ters in the lung . enhancement of the number of virus - specific cd ##8 t cells by im ##mun ##ization with sar ##s - co ##v peptide - pulsed den ##dr ##itic cells also resulted in a robust t cell response , earlier virus clearance , and increased survival . these studies are the first to show that t cells play a crucial role in sar ##s - co ##v clearance and that a sub ##op ##ti ##mal t cell response contributes to the path ##ological changes observed in sar ##s . they also provide a new approach to sar ##s vaccine design .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus that since its emergence in 2012 has caused outbreak ##s in human populations with case - fatal ##ity rates of [UNK] % . as in other corona ##virus ##es , the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of mer ##s - co ##v media ##tes receptor recognition and membrane fusion and is the primary target of the humor ##al immune response during infection . here we use structure - based design to develop a general ##iza ##ble strategy for retaining corona ##virus s proteins in the antigen ##ically optimal pre ##fusion conform ##ation and demonstrate that our engineered im ##mun ##ogen is able to eli ##cit high neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters against mer ##s - co ##v . we also determined high - resolution structures of the trim ##eric mer ##s - co ##v s ec ##to ##dom ##ain in complex with g ##4 , a stem - directed neutral ##izing antibody . the structures reveal that g ##4 recognizes a g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted loop that is variable among corona ##virus ##es and they define four conform ##ation ##al states of the trim ##er wherein each receptor - binding domain is either tightly packed at the membrane - distal apex or rotated into a receptor - accessible conform ##ation . our studies suggest a potential mechanism for fusion initiation through sequential receptor - binding events and provide a foundation for the structure - based design of corona ##virus vaccines .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 . recently , the mer ##s - co ##v receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) was identified and the specific interaction of the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and d ##pp ##4 was determined by crystal ##log ##raphy . animal studies identified r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues but not ham ##sters , fe ##rret ##s , or mice to be susceptible for mer ##s - co ##v . here , we investigated the role of d ##pp ##4 in this observed species tr ##op ##ism . cell lines of human and non ##hum ##an primate origin were per ##missive of mer ##s - co ##v , whereas ham ##ster , fe ##rret , or mouse cell lines were not , despite the presence of d ##pp ##4 . expression of human d ##pp ##4 in non ##sus ##ce ##pt ##ible b ##h ##k and fe ##rret cells enabled mer ##s - co ##v replication , whereas expression of ham ##ster or fe ##rret d ##pp ##4 did not . modeling the binding energies of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein rb ##d to d ##pp ##4 of human ( susceptible ) or ham ##ster ( non ##sus ##ce ##pt ##ible ) identified five amino acid residues involved in the d ##pp ##4 - rb ##d interaction . expression of ham ##ster d ##pp ##4 containing the five human d ##pp ##4 amino acids rendered b ##h ##k cells susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v , whereas expression of human d ##pp ##4 containing the five ham ##ster d ##pp ##4 amino acids did not . using the same approach , the potential of mer ##s - co ##v to utilize the d ##pp ##4 ##s of common middle eastern livestock was investigated . modeling of the d ##pp ##4 and mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d interaction predicted the ability of mer ##s - co ##v to bind the d ##pp ##4 ##s of camel , goat , cow , and sheep . expression of the d ##pp ##4 ##s of these species on b ##h ##k cells supported mer ##s - co ##v replication . this suggests , together with the abundant d ##pp ##4 presence in the respiratory tract , that these species might be able to function as a mer ##s - co ##v intermediate reservoir . importance the ongoing outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused 70 ##1 laboratory - confirmed cases to date , with 249 fatalities . although bats and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been identified as potential mer ##s - co ##v hosts , the virus has so far not been isolated from any species other than humans . the inability of mer ##s - co ##v to in ##fect commonly
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a new , highly con ##tag ##ious , viral disease , emerged in china late in 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 77 ##4 deaths and 80 ##9 ##8 infections worldwide . in the absence of a rapid diagnostic test , therapy or vaccine , isolation of individuals diagnosed with sar ##s and qu ##aran ##tine of individuals feared exposed to sar ##s virus were used to control the spread of infection . we examine mathematical ##ly the impact of isolation and qu ##aran ##tine on the control of sar ##s during the outbreak ##s in toronto , hong kong , singapore and beijing using a deter ##mini ##stic model that closely mimic ##s the data for cumulative infected cases and sar ##s - related deaths in the first three regions but not in beijing until mid - april , when china started to report data more accurately . the results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and disease ##d individuals by iso ##lating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control sar ##s outbreak ##s with or without qu ##aran ##tine . an optimal isolation programme en ##tails timely implementation under string ##ent h ##y ##gie ##nic precautions defined by a critical threshold value . values below this threshold lead to control , but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreak ##s or nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections , a known cause for the spread of sar ##s in each region . allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub - optimal isolation and qu ##aran ##tine together . a community - wide era ##dication of sar ##s is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a deadly form of pneumonia caused by a novel corona ##virus , a viral family responsible for mild respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of animals including humans , pigs , cows , mice , cats , and birds . analyses to date have been unable to identify the precise origin of the sar ##s corona ##virus . we used bay ##esian , neighbor - joining , and split decomposition phylogenetic techniques on the sar ##s virus replica ##se , surface spike , matrix , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins to reveal the evolutionary origin of this recently emerging infectious agent . the analyses support a mammalian - like origin for the replica ##se protein , an av ##ian - like origin for the matrix and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins , and a mammalian - av ##ian mosaic origin for the host - determining spike protein . a boots ##can rec ##om ##bina ##tion analysis of the spike gene revealed high nu ##cle ##otide identity between the sar ##s virus and a fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus throughout the gene , except for a 200 - base - pair region of high identity to an av ##ian sequence . these data support the phylogenetic analyses and suggest a possible past rec ##om ##bina ##tion event between mammalian - like and av ##ian - like parent viruses . this event occurred near a region that has been implicated to be the human receptor binding site and may have been directly responsible for the switch of host of the sar ##s corona ##virus from animals to humans .  
the 2003 global outbreak of progressive respiratory failure was caused by a newly emerged virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in contrast to many well - studied enveloped viruses that assemble and bud at the plasma membrane , corona ##virus ##es assemble by bud ##ding into the lu ##men of the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum - go ##l ##gi intermediate compartment and are released from the cell by ex ##oc ##yt ##osis . for this to occur , the viral envelope proteins must be efficiently targeted to the go ##l ##gi region of the secret ##ory pathway . although the envelope protein ( e ) makes up only a small percentage of the viral envelope , it plays an important , as - yet - und ##efined role in virus production . to di ##sse ##ct the targeting of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein to the go ##l ##gi region , we ex ##ogen ##ously expressed the protein and various mutants from cd ##na and determined their local ##ization using im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence microscopy and bio ##chemical ass ##ays . we show that the cy ##top ##las ##mic tail of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein is sufficient to red ##ire ##ct a plasma membrane protein to the go ##l ##gi region . through site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is , we demonstrate that a predicted beta - hair ##pin structural motif in the tail is sufficient for go ##l ##gi complex local ##ization of a reporter protein . this motif is conserved in e proteins of beta and gamma corona ##virus ##es ( formerly referred to as group 2 and 3 corona ##virus ##es ) , where it also functions as a go ##l ##gi complex - targeting signal . di ##sse ##cting the mechanism of targeting of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein will lead to a better understanding of its role in the assembly and release of vi ##rion ##s .  
the fusion peptide ##s ( f ##p ) play an essential role in fusion of viral envelope with cellular membranes . the location and properties of the f ##ps in the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of different corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) have not yet been determined . through amino acid sequence analysis of s proteins of representative co ##vs , we identified a common region as a possible f ##p ( p ##fp ) that shares the characteristics of f ##ps of class i viral fusion proteins , including high ala / g ##ly content , intermediate hydro ##phobic ##ity , and few charged residues . to test the hypothesis that this region contains the co ##v f ##p , we systemic ##ally mu ##tated every residue in the p ##fp of middle east respiratory syndrome beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and found that 11 of the 22 residues in the p ##fp ( from g ##9 ##53 to l ##9 ##64 , except for a ##9 ##56 ) were essential for s protein - mediated cell - cell fusion and virus entry . the synthetic mer ##s - co ##v p ##fp core peptide ( ( 95 ##5 ) ia ##g ##v ##g ##wt ##ag ##l ( 96 ##4 ) ) induced extensive fusion of lip ##oso ##me membranes , while mutant peptide failed to induce any lip ##id mixing . we also selective ##ly mu ##tated residues in p ##fp ##s of two other β - co ##vs , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) . although the amino acid sequences of these two p ##fp ##s differed significantly from that of mer ##s - co ##v and each other , most of the p ##fp mutants of sar ##s - co ##v and m ##h ##v also failed to media ##te membrane fusion , suggesting that these p ##fp ##s are also the functional f ##ps . thus , the f ##ps of 3 different lineage ##s of β - co ##vs are conserved in location within the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s and in their functions , although their amino acid sequences have diver ##ged significantly during co ##v evolution . importance within the class i viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses , the f ##p is the critical media ##tor of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes leading to virus infection . f ##ps from within a virus family , like influenza viruses or human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency viruses ( hiv ) , tend to share high amino acid sequence identity . in this study , we determined the location and amino acid sequences of the f ##ps of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of 3 β - co ##vs , mer ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v , and m
several respiratory viruses , including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , produce more severe disease in the elderly , yet the molecular mechanisms governing age - related su ##sc ##ept ##ibility remain poorly studied . advanced age was significantly associated with increased sar ##s - related deaths , primarily due to the onset of early - and late - stage acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis . infection of aged , but not young , mice with rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses bearing spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s derived from early human or palm ci ##vet isolate ##s resulted in death accompanied by path ##ological changes associated with ar ##ds . in aged mice , a greater number of differential ##ly expressed genes were observed than in young mice , whose responses were significantly delayed . differences between lethal and non ##let ##hal virus ph ##eno ##type ##s in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetic ##s rather than virus kinetic ##s . sar ##s - co ##v infection induced a range of inter ##fer ##on , cy ##tok ##ine , and pulmonary wound - healing genes , as well as several genes associated with the onset of ar ##ds . mice that died also showed unique transcription ##al profiles of immune response , ap ##op ##tosis , cell cycle control , and stress . cy ##tok ##ines associated with ar ##ds were significantly up ##re ##gul ##ated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease , while the same animals experienced down ##re ##gul ##ation of the ace ##2 receptor . these data suggest that the magnitude and kinetic ##s of a di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethal ##ity . although the molecular mechanisms governing ar ##ds path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy remain unknown in aged animals , these studies reveal a strategy for di ##sse ##cting the genetic pathways by which sar ##s - co ##v infection induce ##s changes in the host response , leading to death .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) utilizes dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) as an entry receptor . mouse d ##pp ##4 ( md ##pp ##4 ) does not support mer ##s - co ##v entry ; however , changes at positions 288 and 330 can con ##fer per ##mis ##si ##vity . position 330 changes the charge and g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion state of md ##pp ##4 . we show that g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion is a major factor impact ##ing d ##pp ##4 receptor function . these results provide insight into d ##pp ##4 species - specific differences impact ##ing mer ##s - co ##v host range and may inform mer ##s - co ##v mouse model development .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a systemic disease characterized by both lung pathology and widespread extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry virus dissemination causing multiple organ injuries . in this regard , renal dysfunction is an ominous sign in patients with sar ##s . indeed , clusters of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) particles have been detected in the cy ##top ##las ##m of renal tubular ep ##ith ##elial cells in post ##mo ##rte ##m studies , explaining the presence of infectious virus in the urine of sar ##s patients . in order to investigate the potential sar ##s - co ##v kidney tr ##op ##ism , we have evaluated the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of human renal cells of tubular and g ##lom ##er ##ular origin to in vitro sar ##s - co ##v infection . immortal ##ized cultures of differentiated pro ##xi ##mal tubular ep ##ith ##elial cells ( pt ##ec ) , g ##lom ##er ##ular mesa ##ng ##ial cells ( mc ) , and g ##lom ##er ##ular ep ##ith ##elial cells ( pod ##ocytes ) were found to express the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 on their surface . productive infection , however , occurred only in pt ##ec but not in g ##lom ##er ##ular cells . a transient infection with poor virus production was observed in mc , whereas pod ##ocytes were not per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v infection . in contrast to the cy ##top ##athic infection of the ve ##ro e ##6 cell line , sar ##s - co ##v did not cause over ##t cy ##top ##athic effects in pt ##ec or mc . of interest , pt ##ec , but not mc , maintained stable levels of sar ##s - co ##v production in serial sub ##culture ##s , suggesting a persistent state of infection . in this regard , a sar ##s - co ##v variant with increased replication capacity in pt ##ec was selected after four serial sub ##culture passages . this sar ##s - co ##v variant acquired a single non ##con ##ser ##vati ##ve amino acid change from g ##lu ##tam ##ic acid ( e ) to alan ##ine ( a ) at position 11 in the viral membrane ( m ) protein . the e ##11 ##a point mutation was sufficient for enhanced sar ##s - co ##v replication and persistence in pt ##ec when introduced in a sar ##s - co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nt infectious clone . these findings indicate that human pt ##ec may represent a site of sar ##s - co ##v productive and persistent replication favor ##ing the emergence of viral variants with increased replication capacity , at least in these kidney cells .  
objective : to understand the association between the sar ##s outbreak and the environmental temperature , and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against it . methods : the daily numbers of the probable sar ##s patients and the daily meteorological factors during the sar ##s outbreak period in hong kong , guangzhou , beijing , and tai ##yuan were used in the data analysis . ecological analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily numbers of probable sar ##s patients and the environmental temperature and its variations . results : there was a significant correlation between the sar ##s cases and the environmental temperature seven days before the onset and the seven day time la ##g corresponds well with the known inc ##uba ##tion period for sar ##s . the opt ##imum environmental temperature associated with the sar ##s cases was between 16 ##° ##c to 28 ##° ##c , which may encourage virus growth . a sharp rise or decrease in the environmental temperature related to the cold spell led to an increase of the sar ##s cases because of the possible influence of the weather on the human immune system . this study provided some evidence that there is a higher possibility for sar ##s to re ##oc ##cu ##r in spring than that in autumn and winter . conclusion : current knowledge based on case studies of the sar ##s outbreak in the four cities suggested that the sar ##s outbreak ##s were significantly associated with the temperature and its variations . however , because the fall ##acy and the un ##con ##tro ##lled con ##fo ##und ##ing effects might have biased the results , the possibility of other meteorological factors having an affect on the sar ##s outbreak ##s deserves further investigation .  
both the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and the spike ( s ) proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) are able to induce strong humor ##al responses in humans following an infection . to compare the im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) responses to the s and n proteins of sar ##s - co ##v in sar ##s patients during the manifestation / con ##vale ##scent period with those during the post ##in ##fect ##ion period , serum samples were collected from hospitalized sar ##s patients within 6 weeks after the onset of illness ( set 1 ; 57 sequential samples from 19 patients ) or 2 to 3 months after their recovery ( set 2 ; 33 post ##in ##fect ##ion samples from 33 subjects ) . serum samples from 100 healthy blood donors ( set 3 ) , collected in 2002 , were also included . the specific i ##gg response to whole virus , the fragment from positions 450 to 650 of the s protein ( s ##45 ##0 - 650 ) , and the full - length n protein of sar ##s - co ##v were measured by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ##s ) . western b ##lot ass ##ays were carried out to confirm the elisa results . fifty - one of the serum samples in set 1 ( 89 % ) bound to the n protein , a proportion similar to that which recognized whole virus ( 79 % ) and the s - protein fragment ( 77 % ) . all 33 serum samples from set 2 were strongly positive for n - protein - specific i ##gg , while 27 ( 82 % ) were positive for anti - s ##45 ##0 - 650 i ##gg . two of the serum samples from set 3 were strongly positive for anti - n - protein i ##gg but not anti - s ##45 ##0 - 650 i ##gg . similar levels of i ##gg responses to the s and n proteins were observed in sar ##s patients during the manifestation and con ##vale ##scent stages . in the post ##in ##fect ##ion period , however , a number of patients had much lower serum i ##gg levels against s ##45 ##0 - 650 than against the n protein .  
the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) remains unclear . macro ##pha ##ges are key sentinel cells in the respiratory system , and it is therefore relevant to compare the responses of human macro ##pha ##ges to infections with the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and other respiratory viruses . primary human mono ##cy ##te - derived macro ##pha ##ges were infected with sar ##s - co ##v in vitro . virus replication was monitored by measuring the levels of positive - and negative - strand rna , by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence detection of the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein , and by ti ##tra ##tion of the infectious virus . the gene expression profiles of macro ##pha ##ges infected with sar ##s - co ##v , human corona ##virus 229 ##e , and influenza a ( h ##1 ##n ##1 ) virus were compared by using micro ##ar ##ray ##s and real - time quantitative reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r . secret ##ed cy ##tok ##ines were measured with an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay . sar ##s - co ##v initiated viral gene transcription and protein synthesis in macro ##pha ##ges , but replication was ab ##ort ##ive and no infectious virus was produced . in contrast to the case with human corona ##virus 229 ##e and influenza a virus , there was little or no induction of beta inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - β ) in sar ##s - co ##v - infected macro ##pha ##ges . furthermore , sar ##s - co ##v induced the expression of che ##mo ##kin ##es such as c ##x ##cl ##10 / if ##n - γ - ind ##ucible protein 10 and cc ##l ##2 / mono ##cy ##te che ##mot ##actic protein 1 . the poor induction of if ##n - β , a key component of innate immunity , and the ability of the virus to induce che ##mo ##kin ##es could explain aspects of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 15 ( ns ##p ##15 ) encoded by corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is a ni ##do ##vira ##l ur ##id ##yla ##te - specific end ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se ( ne ##ndo ##u ) that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus . structural information on this crucial protein from the middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , which is lethal ##ly pathogen ##ic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide , is lacking . here , we determined the crystal structure of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##15 at a 2 . 7 - a resolution and performed the relevant bio ##chemical ass ##ays to study how ne ##ndo ##u activity is regulated . although the overall structure is conserved , mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homo ##log ##s . ser ##ine substitution of residue f ##28 ##5 , which harbor ##s an aromatic side chain that disturb ##s rna binding compared with that of other homo ##log ##s , increases catalytic activity . mutations of residues residing on the ol ##igo ##mer ##ization interfaces that di ##stor ##t he ##xa ##mer ##ization , namely , n ##38 ##a , y ##58 ##a , and n ##15 ##7 ##a , decrease the ##rm ##osta ##bility , decrease affinity of binding with rna , and reduce the ne ##ndo ##u activity of ns ##p ##15 . in contrast , mutant d ##39 ##a exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity . importantly , ns ##p ##8 was found to interact with both mono ##meric and he ##xa ##meric ns ##p ##15 . the ns ##p ##7 / ns ##p ##8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for ns ##p ##15 . furthermore , ns ##p ##8 and the ns ##p ##7 / ns ##p ##8 complex also enhance the ne ##ndo ##u activity of he ##xa ##meric ns ##p ##15 in vitro . taking the findings together , this work first provides evidence on how the activity of ns ##p ##15 may be functional ##ly mediated by catalytic residues , ol ##igo ##meric assembly , rna binding efficiency , or the possible association with other non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins . importance the lethal ##ly pathogen ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) pose serious threats to humans . end ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se ns ##p ##15 encoded by corona ##virus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogen ##esis . this study determines the structure of mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated , thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing anti ##vira ##l drugs . we also h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize that the prima
effective prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies are urgently needed in the event of re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of the highly con ##tag ##ious and often fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . we have identified eight rec ##om ##bina ##nt human single - chain variable region fragments ( sc ##f ##vs ) against the s ##1 domain of spike ( s ) protein of the sar ##s - co ##v from two non ##im ##mun ##e human antibody libraries . one sc ##f ##v 80 ##r efficiently neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v and inhibit ##ed sync ##yt ##ia formation between cells expressing the s protein and those expressing the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . mapping of the 80 ##r ep ##ito ##pe showed it is located within the n - terminal 261 – 67 ##2 amino acids of s protein and is not g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion - dependent . 80 ##r sc ##f ##v competed with soluble ace ##2 for association with the s ##1 domain and bound s ##1 with high affinity ( equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant , k ( d ) = 32 . 3 nm ) . a human i ##gg ##1 form of 80 ##r bound s ##1 with a 20 - fold higher affinity of 1 . 59 nm comparable to that of ace ##2 ( k ( d ) = 1 . 70 nm ) , and neutral ##ized virus 20 - fold more efficiently than the 80 ##r sc ##f ##v . these data suggest that the 80 ##r human mono ##cl ##onal antibody may be a useful viral entry inhibitor for the emergency prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and treatment of sar ##s , and that the ace ##2 - binding site of s ##1 could be an attractive target for subunit vaccine and drug development .  
to evaluate the risk of transmission of sar ##s corona ##virus outside of the health - care setting , close household and community contacts of laboratory - confirmed sar ##s cases were identified and followed up for clinical and laboratory evidence of sar ##s infection . individual - and household - level risk factors for transmission were investigated . nine persons with ser ##ological evidence of sar ##s infection were identified amongst 212 close contacts of 45 laboratory - confirmed sar ##s cases ( secondary attack rate 4 · 2 % , 95 % ci 1 · 5 – 7 ) . in this co ##hort , the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious case was 0 · 2 . two community contacts with laboratory evidence of sar ##s corona ##virus infection had mild or sub - clinical infection , representing 3 % ( 2 / 65 ) of vietnamese sar ##s cases . there was no evidence of transmission of infection before sy ##mpt ##om onset . physically caring for a sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic laboratory - confirmed sar ##s case was the only independent risk factor for sar ##s transmission ( or 5 · 78 , 95 % ci 1 · 23 – 24 · 24 ) .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus . since its associated mor ##bid ##ity and mortality have been post ##ulated to be due to immune d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation , we investigated which of the viral proteins is responsible for che ##mo ##kin ##e over ##ex ##press ##ion . to del ##ine ##ate the viral and cellular factor interactions , the role of four sar ##s corona ##virus proteins , including non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 1 ( ns ##p - 1 ) , ns ##p - 5 , envelope , and membrane , were examined in terms of cy ##tok ##ine induction . our results showed that the sar ##s corona ##virus ns ##p - 1 plays an important role in cc ##l ##5 , c ##x ##cl ##10 , and cc ##l ##3 expression in human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells via the activation of n ##f - κ ##b .  
two corona ##virus ##es causing severe respiratory disease and high mortality rates emerging within the past dozen years reinforce ##s the need for clinical ##ly e ##ffi ##ca ##cious anti ##vira ##ls targeting corona ##virus ##es . alternative screening approaches for anti ##vira ##ls against the recently emerge ##nt middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) may provide lead compounds to address this need . two anti ##mic ##ro ##bial agents and chemotherapy ( aa ##c ) papers screened libraries of approved compounds that may potentially be rep ##ur ##posed as mer ##s - co ##v anti ##vira ##ls . a third aa ##c paper showed that a previously described severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) he ##lica ##se inhibitor also has activity against mer ##s - co ##v .  
to clarify the molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) adaptation to different host species , we serial ##ly passage ##d sar ##s - co ##v in rat ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) - expressing cells . after 15 passages , the virus ( rat - p ##15 ) came to replicate effectively in rat ace ##2 - expressing cells . two amino acid substitution ##s in the s ##2 region were found on the rat - p ##15 s gene . analyses of the in ##fect ##ivity of the pseudo ##type - bearing s protein indicated that the two substitution ##s in the s ##2 region , especially the s ##9 ##50 ##f substitution , were responsible for efficient infection . therefore , virus adaptation to different host species can be induced by amino acid substitution ##s in the s ##2 region .  
it has been proved that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by sar ##s - associated corona ##virus , a novel corona ##virus . sar ##s originated in guangdong province , the people ' s republic of china at the end of 2002 . at present , it has spread to more than 33 countries or regions all over the world and affected 83 ##60 people and killed 76 ##4 by may 31 , 2003 . identification of the sar ##s ca ##usa ##tive agent and development of a diagnostic test are important . detecting disease in its early stage , understanding its pathways of transmission and implementing specific prevention measures for the disease are dependent upon swift progress . due to the efforts of the who - led network of laboratories testing for sar ##s , tests for the novel corona ##virus have been developed with unprecedented speed . the genome sequence reveals that this corona ##virus is only moderately related to other known corona ##virus ##es . who established the definitions of suspected and confirmed and probable cases . but the laboratory tests and definitions are limited . until now , the primary measures included isolation , rib ##avi ##rin and co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid therapy , mechanical ventilation , etc . other the ##ra ##pies such as con ##vale ##scent plasma are being explored . it is necessary to find more effective therapy . there still are many problems to be solved in the course of conquer ##ing sar ##s .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused a worldwide epidemic in late 2002 / early 2003 and a second outbreak in the winter of 2003 / 2004 by an independent animal - to - human transmission . the g ##d ##0 ##3 strain , which was isolated from an index patient of the second outbreak , was reported to resist neutral ##ization by the human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( hm ##ab ##s ) 80 ##r and s ##3 . 1 , which can potent ##ly neutral ##ize isolate ##s from the first outbreak . here we report that two hm ##ab ##s , m3 ##9 ##6 and s ##23 ##0 . 15 , potent ##ly neutral ##ized g ##d ##0 ##3 and representative isolate ##s from the first sar ##s outbreak ( urban ##i , tor ##2 ) and from palm ci ##vet ##s ( s ##z ##3 , s ##z ##16 ) . these antibodies also protected mice challenged with the urban ##i or rec ##om ##bina ##nt viruses bearing the g ##d ##0 ##3 and s ##z ##16 spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s . both antibodies competed with the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , ace ##2 , for binding to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , suggesting a mechanism of neutral ##ization that involves interference with the sar ##s - co ##v – ace ##2 interaction . two put ##ative hot - spot residues in the rb ##d ( ile - 48 ##9 and ty ##r - 49 ##1 ) were identified within the sar ##s - co ##v spike that likely contribute to most of the m3 ##9 ##6 - binding energy . residues ile - 48 ##9 and ty ##r - 49 ##1 are highly conserved within the sar ##s - co ##v spike , indicating a possible mechanism of the m3 ##9 ##6 cross - react ##ivity . sequence analysis and mu ##tage ##nes ##is data show that m3 ##9 ##6 might neutral ##ize all zoo ##not ##ic and epidemic sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s with known sequences , except strains derived from bats . these antibodies exhibit cross - react ##ivity against isolate ##s from the two sar ##s outbreak ##s and palm ci ##vet ##s and could have potential applications for diagnosis , prop ##hyl ##ax ##is , and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infections .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) cause epidemic ##s of severe human respiratory disease . a conserved step of co ##v replication is the translation and processing of replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s containing 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein domains ( ns ##p ' s 1 to 16 ) . the co ##v ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ; mp ##ro ) processes ns ##p ' s at 11 cleavage sites and is essential for virus replication . co ##v ns ##p ##5 has a conserved 3 - domain structure and catalytic residues . however , the intra - and inter ##mo ##le ##cular deter ##mina ##nts of ns ##p ##5 activity and their conservation across diver ##gent co ##vs are unknown , in part due to challenges in cult ##ivating many human and zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs . to test for conservation of ns ##p ##5 structure - function deter ##mina ##nts , we engineered chi ##meric beta ##cor ##ona ##virus mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) genome ##s encoding ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##ses of human and bat alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . exchange of ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##ses from hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , which share the same gen ##og ##roup , gen ##og ##roup 2a , with m ##h ##v , allowed for immediate viral recovery with efficient replication albeit with impaired fitness in direct competition with wild - type m ##h ##v . introduction of m ##h ##v ns ##p ##5 temperature - sensitive mutations into chi ##meric hk ##u ##1 and o ##c ##43 ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##ses resulted in clear differences in via ##bility and temperature - sensitive ph ##eno ##type ##s compared with m ##h ##v ns ##p ##5 . these data indicate tight genetic link ##age and coe ##vo ##lu ##tion between ns ##p ##5 pro ##tea ##se and the gen ##omic background and identify differences in intra ##mo ##le ##cular networks regulating ns ##p ##5 function . our results also provide evidence that chi ##meric viruses within corona ##virus gen ##og ##roup ##s can be used to test ns ##p ##5 deter ##mina ##nts of function and inhibition in common iso ##genic backgrounds and cell types .  
middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) continues to raise worldwide concerns due to its pan ##de ##mic potential . increased mer ##s cases and no licensed mer ##s vaccines highlight the need to develop safe and effective vaccines against mer ##s . we have previously demonstrated that a receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) fragment containing residues 37 ##7 – 58 ##8 of mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) spike protein is a critical neutral ##izing domain and an important vaccine target . nevertheless , its optimal im ##mun ##ogen dos ##age and im ##mun ##ization interval , key factors for human - used vaccines that induce protective immunity , have never been investigated . in this study , we opt ##imi ##zed these criteria using a rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d protein fused with fc ( s ##37 ##7 – 58 ##8 - fc ) and utilized the optimal im ##mun ##ization schedule to evaluate the protective efficacy of rb ##d against mer ##s - co ##v infection in human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 trans ##genic ( hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g ) mice . compared with one dose and 2 doses at 1 - , 2 - , and 3 - week intervals , a regime ##n of 2 doses of this protein separated by an interval of 4 weeks induced the strongest antibody response and neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v infection , and maintained at a high level during the detection period . notably , rb ##d protein at the optimal dos ##age and interval protected hd ##pp ##4 - t ##g mice against lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge , and the protection was positively correlated with serum neutral ##izing antibodies . taken together , the optimal im ##mun ##ogen dos ##age and im ##mun ##ization interval identified in this study will provide useful guidelines for further development of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - based vaccines for human use .  
there have been 204 ##0 laboratory - confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 27 countries , with a mortality rate of 34 . 9 % . there is no specific therapy . the current the ##ra ##pies have mainly been adapted from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) treatments , including broad - spectrum antibiotics , co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids , inter ##fer ##ons , rib ##avi ##rin , lo ##pina ##vir – ri ##ton ##avi ##r or my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late mo ##fe ##ti ##l , and have not been subject to well - organized clinical trials . the development of specific the ##ra ##pies and vaccines is therefore urgently required . we examine existing and potential the ##ra ##pies and vaccines from a molecular perspective . these include viral s protein targeting ; inhibitors of host pro ##tea ##ses , including t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , cat ##he ##ps ##in l and fur ##in pro ##tea ##se , and of viral m ( pro ) and the pl ( pro ) pro ##tea ##ses ; con ##vale ##scent plasma ; and vaccine candidates . the med ##line database was searched using combinations and variations of terms , including ‘ middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ’ , ‘ mer ##s - co ##v ’ , ‘ sar ##s ’ , ‘ therapy ’ , ‘ molecular ’ , ‘ vaccine ’ , ‘ prop ##hyl ##actic ’ , ‘ s protein ’ , ‘ d ##pp ##4 ’ , ‘ he ##pta ##d repeat ’ , ‘ pro ##tea ##se ’ , ‘ inhibitor ’ , ‘ anti - viral ’ , ‘ broad - spectrum ’ , ‘ inter ##fer ##on ’ , ‘ con ##vale ##scent plasma ’ , ‘ lo ##pina ##vir ri ##ton ##avi ##r ’ , ‘ antibodies ’ , ‘ anti ##vira ##l peptide ##s ’ and ‘ live at ##ten ##uated viruses ’ . there are many options for the development of mer ##s - co ##v - specific the ##ra ##pies . currently , mer ##s - co ##v is not considered to have pan ##de ##mic potential . however , the high mortality rate and potential for mutations that could increase trans ##mis ##sibility give urgency to the search for direct , effective the ##ra ##pies . well - designed and controlled clinical trials are needed , both for existing the ##ra ##pies and for prospective direct the ##ra ##pies .  
exposed ep ##ito ##pes of the spike protein may be recognized by neutral ##izing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . a protein fragment ( s - ii ) containing predicted ep ##ito ##pes of the spike protein was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . the properly ref ##old ##ed protein fragment specifically bound to the surface of ve ##ro cells . mono ##cl ##onal antibodies raised against this fragment recognized the native spike protein of sar ##s co ##v in both mono ##meric and trim ##eric forms . these mono ##cl ##onal antibodies were capable of blocking s - ii attachment to ve ##ro cells and exhibited in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity . these neutral ##izing antibodies mapped to ep ##ito ##pes in two peptide ##s , each comprising 20 amino acids . thus , this region of the spike protein might be a target for generation of therapeutic neutral ##izing antibodies against sar ##s co ##v and for vaccine development to eli ##cit protective humor ##al immunity .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was identified to be the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s with at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the major receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . it is not clear whether ace ##2 convey ##s signals from the cell surface to the nucleus and regulates expression of cellular genes upon sar ##s - co ##v infection . to understand the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v , human type ii p ##ne ##um ##oc ##yte ( a ##54 ##9 ) cells were inc ##uba ##ted with the viral spike protein or with sar ##s - co ##v virus - like particles containing the viral spike protein to examine cy ##tok ##ine modulation in lung cells . results from ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide - based micro ##ar ##ray , real - time pc ##r , and enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays indicated an up ##re ##gul ##ation of the fi ##bro ##sis - associated che ##mo ##kin ##e ( c - c motif ) ligand 2 ( cc ##l ##2 ) by the viral spike protein and the virus - like particles . the up ##re ##gul ##ation of cc ##l ##2 by sar ##s - co ##v spike protein was mainly mediated by extra ##cellular signal - regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( er ##k ##1 / 2 ) and ap - 1 but not the i ##κ ##b ##α - n ##f - κ ##b signaling pathway . in addition , ras and raf upstream of the er ##k ##1 / 2 signaling pathway were involved in the up ##re ##gul ##ation of cc ##l ##2 . furthermore , ace ##2 receptor was activated by case ##in kinase ii - mediated ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation in cells pre ##tre ##ated with the virus - like particles containing spike protein . these results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v spike protein triggers ace ##2 signaling and activate ##s fi ##bro ##sis - associated cc ##l ##2 expression through the ras - er ##k - ap - 1 pathway .  
background : a deadly zoo ##not ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) had emerged over the last 7 years in the arabian peninsula . as of february 28 , 2018 , 2 , 182 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection ( with 77 ##9 deaths ) in 27 countries were reported to who worldwide . the objectives of this study were to identify the clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological characteristics of mer ##s - co ##v infection as well as determine its clinical outcome . methods : this was a retrospective - observation ##al study of all laboratory confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection conducted at the main seven hospitals in the state of qatar from january , 2012 to april 2018 . we used the fast track diagnostic ##s real - time reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) , targeting the up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a genes respectively . demographics , clinical information , potential contacts and probable risk factors were collected and analyzed by standard statistical methods . results : the mean annual incidence was 1 . 7 per 100 , 000 ##0 person - years . among the 24 confirmed cases of of mer ##s - co ##v , males constituted the vast majority of cases ( 23 males ) with a median age of 52 years ( range 22 – 74 ) . fifty percent of the cases were qatar ##i and 42 % reside in the same region . 67 % of the cases had contact with camel ##s , and 21 % had contact with mer ##s - co ##v - infected patient . thirty - eight had travel history within 2 weeks of symptoms onset to the kingdom of saudi arabia . fifty percent were smoke ##rs and 42 % had como ##rb ##idi ##ties . the median symptoms duration was 4 . 5 days . most of the patient presented with flu - like symptoms , were fever was the most common presentation , followed by cough , sob , dia ##rr ##hea , abdominal pain and headache , 96 % , 83 % , 33 % , 8 % , 8 % and 4 % , respectively . all patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital with a median hospital stay 41 days ( 8 – 97 ) . forty - five percent patients developed severe sep ##sis with multi - organ failure and needed ic ##u admission . fifty percent patients developed acute kidney injury , 29 % patients were on hem ##od ##ial ##ysis and 16 % needed extra - corp ##ore ##al membrane oxygen ##ation . thirty - three percent patients died . the rest of patients had recovered from the infection and discharged home . among those who died all had one or more como ##rb ##idi ##ties . conclusion : mer ##s - co ##v infection is a rare infection in the state
background : in 2015 , an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection occurred in south korea involving 186 patients , 39 of whom were healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) exposed to the infection . an effective post - exposure prop ##hyl ##ax ##is ( pep ) strategy may limit the spread of infection ; however , there is no consensus regarding pep for mer ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we assessed ( 1 ) the efficacy of oral rib ##avi ##rin and lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r as pep for hc ##ws exposed to patients with severe mer ##s - co ##v pre - isolation pneumonia , and ( 2 ) safety of the pep regime ##n . methods : we retrospective ##ly enrolled 43 hc ##ws with high - risk exposure to mer ##s - co ##v from 5 hospitals affected during this outbreak in south korea . the rate of mer ##s - co ##v infection was compared between 22 workers at 1 hospital who received pep consisting of oral rib ##avi ##rin and lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r after exposure to patients with severe mer ##s - co ##v pre - isolation pneumonia and 21 workers at other hospitals who did not receive pep . results : six workers ( 14 % ) developed mer ##s - co ##v infection ; all of these subjects belonged to the non - pep group . the attack rate was lower in the pep group compared with the non - pep group ( 0 % vs . 28 . 6 % ; odds ratio = 0 . 405 , 95 % confidence interval = 0 . 274 – 0 . 59 ##9 ; p = 0 . 00 ##9 ) . the most commonly reported side effects of pep therapy were nausea and dia ##rr ##hea , but there were no severe adverse effects associated with pep therapy . conclusion : pep with a combination of oral rib ##avi ##rin and lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r appears to be effective and generally safe for preventing mer ##s - co ##v infection after high - risk exposure in healthcare workers . disclosure ##s : all authors : no reported disclosure ##s .  
bats are the natural reservoir of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) . human co ##vs cause mild respiratory diseases worldwide , but , in the last decade , two beta - co ##vs [ middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v and severe acute respiratory syndrome ] caused thousands of deaths and cases worldwide . phylogenetic analysis suggested the evolutionary origin of mammalian co ##vs is derived from bats . in this study , we characterized three alpha - co ##vs and two beta - co ##vs demonstrating the circulation of bat strains in italy . isolate ##s were sequence ##d using a next - generation sequencing approach and genome ##s reconstructed using the online tool galaxy ari ##es . phylogenetic analyses were conducted using mega ##7 and mr ##bay ##es . similarity plots were generated using ss ##e v ##1 . 2 . the structure of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s protein was predicted by sequence - homo ##logy method using the protein data bank . bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis permitted the identification of 2 beta - co ##v complete genome ##s of 30 kb and three alpha - co ##v of 28 kb ( named bat ##co ##v - it ##a1 - 5 ) . bat ##co ##v - it ##a1 and 2 formed a mono ##phy ##let ##ic group with mer ##s - co ##v sequences . the comparison of the con ##cate ##nated domains within or ##f ##1 ##ab confirmed their classification into the mer ##s - co ##v species . the 3d structure of rb ##d of italian strains showed two amino acid del ##eti ##ons located in a region corresponding to the external sub ##dom ##ain of mer ##s - rb ##d . bat ##co ##v - it ##a ##3 and bat ##co ##v - it ##a ##4 / 5 were classified into two novel alpha - co ##v species by comparison of con ##cate ##nated domains within or ##f ##1 ##ab . due to the high diver ##gence with the alpha human spike protein strains , it was impossible to establish the protein structure and the potential affinity to human receptor . the italian strains showed the typical organization of alpha and beta - co ##vs . we reported two beta - co ##vs closely related to mer ##s - co ##vs from bats belonging to common italian species ( pip ##ist ##rell ##us ku ##hli ##i and h ##yp ##su ##go sa ##vi ##i ) . the analysis of the rb ##d in the spike protein indicates significant differences from human rb ##d known to date . the three alpha - co ##v strains were classified into two novel species , confirming the high het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y of co ##v strains in bats . although the studies conducted cannot confirm a risk for humans , surveillance studies are needed to investigate the genetic diversity of co ##vs in bats . because this exceeds what is known for other
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a zoo ##not ##ic respiratory disease of global public health concern , and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the only proven source of this zoo ##not ##ic infection . although mer ##s - co ##v infection is ubiquitous in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies across africa and the arabian peninsula , the continuous appearance of zoo ##not ##ic mer ##s cases in humans is confined to the arabian peninsula . mer ##s - co ##v from africa has hit ##her ##to been poorly studied . here , we report the genetic and ph ##eno ##typic characterization of mer ##s - co ##v from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in african countries . phylogenetic ##ally , viruses from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in africa formed a mono ##phy ##let ##ic clade , which we have provisional ##ly designated as virus clade c . molecular dating analyses of mer ##s - co ##v , including clade c viruses , suggests that the ancestral mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies could have spread to the two continents within a short time ##frame . camel mer ##s - co ##vs from west and north african countries form a sub ##cl ##ade ( c1 ) that shares genetic signatures of a major del ##eti ##on in the accessory gene or ##f ##4 ##b . compared with human and camel mer ##s - co ##v from saudi arabia , virus isolate ##s from burkina faso ( bf ##7 ##85 ) and nigeria ( ni ##g ##16 ##57 ) had lower virus replication competence in cal ##u - 3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bro ##nch ##us and lung , and bf ##7 ##85 replicate ##d to lower ti ##ter in lungs of human d ##pp ##4 - trans ##duced mice . however , it is still inc ##on ##clusive whether or ##f ##4 ##b del ##eti ##ons may lead to the reduced replication competence of bf ##7 ##85 and ni ##g ##16 ##57 . genetic and ph ##eno ##typic differences in west african viruses may be relevant to the zoo ##not ##ic potential of mer ##s - co ##v .  
human middle east respiratory syndrome is a zoo ##not ##ic respiratory disease caused by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) originating from camel ##s in the arabian peninsula . while there are a large number of camel ##s in east africa , often traded to the arabian peninsula , no auto ##cht ##hon ##ous human mer ##s - co ##v case is reported in east africa . furthermore , there is limited information of mer ##s - co ##v in east africa . in this study , mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from ethiopia was detected using rt - q ##pc ##r . next - generation sequencing was used to obtain the full genome of mer ##s - co ##v . mer ##s - co ##v antibodies were also detected through mer ##s - spike pseudo ##par ##tic ##le neutral ##ization ass ##ay . phylogenetic analysis of full - genome sequences and spike - genome antibodies indicates that mer ##s - co ##v in east africa is genetically distinct from those in the arabian peninsula . the results from this study show that mer ##s - co ##v circulating in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in east africa are genetically distinct from those in the arabian peninsula . further studies are needed to evaluate the risk of zoo ##not ##ic transmission in east africa .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are enveloped , single stranded , positive - sense rna viruses with a large gen ##omic size of 26 – 32 ki ##lo ##base ##s . the first human co ##v identified in the 1960s was isolated from patients presenting with common cold symptoms . subsequent epidemic outbreak ##s of novel zoo ##not ##ic co ##v transmission were reported , examples including hc ##ov - 229 ##e ( 229 ##e ) , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ( o ##c ##43 ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome , and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . the ongoing outbreak of mer ##s in the middle east is originating from a zoo ##not ##ic source of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . surveillance later revealed that three co ##v species — hc ##ov - 229 ##e ( 229 ##e ) , camel - hk ##u ##23 , and mer ##s - co ##v — were co - circulating in saudi arabia dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . camel - hk ##u ##23 belongs to group 2a co ##v , which also includes human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 , bo ##vine corona ##virus , and por ##cine hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ing en ##ce ##pha ##lom ##ye ##lit ##is virus . rec ##om ##bina ##tion , resulting in the generation of different novel gen ##otype ##s , has been reported previously among these co ##vs . our surveillance of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s slaughtered in a major aba ##tto ##ir in nigeria identified camel - hk ##u ##23 from nasal sw ##ab samples with a prevalence of 2 . 2 per cent . phylogenetic analysis showed nigeria camel - hk ##u ##23 is distinct from those previously identified in saudi arabia , while still genetically similar , as they share a mono ##phy ##let ##ic origin . rec ##om ##bina ##tion analysis of nigeria camel - hk ##u ##23 revealed two rec ##om ##bina ##tion break ##points at positions of 227 ##7 ##4 – 241 ##00 base pairs ( bp ) and 282 ##24 – 293 ##6 ##2 bp . rec ##om ##bina ##tion break ##point at position 227 ##7 ##4 , encoding the group 2a co ##v - specific hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin este ##rase gene , exhibited high boots ##tra ##p support for cluster ##ing with rb ##co ##v hk ##u ##14 , which was previously detected in domestic rabbits in china . the rec ##om ##bina ##tion signal is only observed in nigeria camel - hk ##u ##23 , suggesting a regional varied evolutionary history of camel - hk ##u ##23 . our findings extended the knowledge of the evolutionary relationship among group 2a co ##vs . further surveillance in other african camel ##s will be important to el ##uc ##ida ##te the evolution of camel - hk ##u ##23 .  
the 2019 - novel corona ##virus ( nc ##ov ) is a major source of disaster in the 21 ( th ) century . however , the lack of specific drugs to prevent / treat an attack is a major need at this current point of time . in this regard , we conducted a systematic review to identify major drug ##ga ##ble targets in corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . we searched pub ##med and rc ##sb database with key ##words hc ##ov , nc ##ov , corona virus , ser ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , 2019 - nc ##ov , crystal structure , x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy structure , nm ##r structure , target , and drug target till feb 3 , 2020 . the search identified seven major targets ( spike protein , en ##vel ##op protein , membrane protein , pro ##tea ##se , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin este ##rase , and he ##lica ##se ) for which drug design can be considered . there are other 16 non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##ps ) , which can also be considered from the drug design perspective . the major structural proteins and ns ##ps may serve an important role from drug design perspectives . however , the occurrence of frequent rec ##om ##bina ##tion events is a major deter ##rent factor toward the development of co ##v - specific vaccines / drugs .  
the sar ##s - epidemic of 2002 / 2003 with worldwide 8 . 09 ##6 cases and 77 ##4 fatalities was the first pan ##de ##mia of the 21 ( st ) century . sar ##s , the severe acute respiratory syndrome , arose in southern china and spread from southeast - asia finally over all five continents . it caused heavy pneumonia with pu ##lm ##onal failure and enter ##ic involvement in man . the ca ##usa ##tive agent was a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which was transmitted from bats to small car ##ni ##vor ##es and from them to man . the mutations of the viral receptor gene thus allowed the infection of man and the transmission from man to man . the sar ##s - pan ##de ##mia can therefore be regarded as a model of an emerging disease .  
evaluation of : cough ##lin mm , ba ##bc ##ook j , pr ##ab ##hak ##ar bs : human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies to sar ##s - corona ##virus inhibit infection by different mechanisms . vi ##rol ##ogy 39 ##4 ( 1 ) , 39 – 46 ( 2009 ) . this work discusses passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py based on neutral ##izing human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) with different mechanisms of action . the authors have demonstrated that combining such mab ##s , which target distinct ep ##ito ##pes , may greatly increase inhibition of virus infection and suppress the generation of neutral ##ization escape mutants . the inhibition of human mab ##s to sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) may also act through different mechanisms of action , depending on their target ep ##ito ##pes or regions . therefore , this approach could provide fast and effective prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infection during a sar ##s outbreak . specifically , cough ##lin et al . have indicated that most of the tested anti - s ##1 mab ##s recognized ep ##ito ##pes within the receptor - binding domain and blocked virus attachment to its cellular receptor . these findings could provide a further step in understanding the mechanism of these mab ##s in the prevention of sar ##s - co ##v infection , as well as an insight into the design and development of novel therapeutic treatments .  
up to november 2014 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected 93 ##5 individuals and killed 37 ##1 , all originating in or with links to the middle east . the mechanisms of transmission of the disease are not fully understood , but mer ##s - co ##v seems to sustain itself in the human population through repeated re - introduction from a camel reservoir and is able to cause nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s . the risk of a global spread of mer ##s - co ##v is low . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , ser ##ological and phylogenetic research , combined with one health surveillance , dynamic case definitions , active case finding , rigorous infection control , culturally sensitive risk communication and a continuous re - evaluation of new evidence will enable to better understand the disease , limit its spread and quan ##tify its risk in order to better prepare for a hypothetical spread .  
the first case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified in the year 2012 , which spread rapidly and increased to more than 220 ##0 in 2018 . this highly pathogen ##ic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns . saudi arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of mer ##s - co ##v cases , and currently , no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment . a large amount of information is now available regarding the virus , its structure , route of transmission and its path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy . therefore , this review sum ##mar ##izes the current understanding of mer ##s - co ##v ' s pathogen ##esis , treatment options and recent scientific advancement ##s in vaccine and other therapeutic developments , and the major steps taken for mer ##s prevention control .  
many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoo ##not ##ic event . some of the diseases caused by these zoo ##not ##ic events have affected millions of people around the world , some of which have resulted in high rates of mor ##bid ##ity / mortality in humans . changes in the viral proteins that function as ligand ##s of the host receptor may promote the spill ##over between species . the most recent of these zoo ##not ##ic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the co ##vid - 19 epidemic ##s caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the aim of this study was to determine the mutation ( s ) in the sequence of the spike protein of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that might be favor ##ing human to human transmission . an in si ##lic ##o approach was performed , and changes were detected in the s ##1 subunit of the receptor - binding domain of spike . the observed changes have significant effect on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike / ace ##2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy , compared to the one of the bat - co ##v to this receptor . the data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein to the human ace ##2 receptor , compared to the one of bat - co ##v spike and ace ##2 . this could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in humans .  
direct - acting anti ##vira ##ls are effective tools to control viral infections . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a corona ##virus associated with the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological outbreak in late 2019 . previous reports showed that hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors could block sar ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se . based on that and using an in si ##lic ##o approach , we evaluated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se as a target for hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their anti ##vira ##l effect . our results showed that several hiv inhibitors such as lo ##pina ##vir , ri ##ton ##avi ##r , and sa ##quin ##avi ##r produce strong interaction with the active site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se . furthermore , broad library pro ##tea ##se inhibitors obtained from pub ##che ##m and zinc ( www . zinc . docking . org ) were evaluated . our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features . then , these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives opt ##imi ##zing their activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other corona ##virus ##es . altogether , the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular ph ##arm ##aco ##logy of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 treatment and valid ##ate the use of pro ##tea ##se inhibitors against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) contains four major structural proteins , the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein , membrane ( m ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and small envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . the m protein of mer ##s - co ##v has a role in the mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis or assembly of the virus and inhibit ##s type i inter ##fer ##on expression in infected cells . here , we produced a mono ##cl ##onal antibody specific against the m protein of mer ##s - co ##v by in ##ject ##ing bal ##b / c mice with a complex containing the ep ##ito ##pe peptide and cp ##g – dna en ##cap ##sul ##ated with a ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##l - β - ole ##oy ##l - γ - palm ##ito ##yl ethanol ##amine ( do ##pe ) : cho ##les ##terol hem ##is ##ucci ##nate ( che ##ms ) . the mono ##cl ##onal antibody was reactive to the ep ##ito ##pe peptide of the m protein of mer ##s - co ##v which was confirmed by western b ##lot ##ting and im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ations . indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay and con ##fo ##cal image analysis showed that the mono ##cl ##onal antibody binds specifically to the m protein of mer ##s - co ##v in the virus - infected cells . further studies using this mono ##cl ##onal antibody may provide important information on the function of the m protein and its future application in diagnostic ##s .  
analysis of proteins that interact with n protein of sar ##s - co ##v using 15 - mer ph ##age - displayed library will help to explore the virus pathogen ##esis and to develop new drugs and vaccines against sar ##s . in this study , we clone ##d , expressed and pu ##rified n protein of sar ##s - co ##v . this 46 - k ##d n protein was verified by sd ##s - page and western - b ##lot . then , the peptide ##s binding - specific to n protein were identified using 15 - mer ph ##age - displayed library . surprisingly , all of the 89 clones from mono ##cl ##onal elisa were positive ( s / n > 2 . 1 ) and the result was further confirmed experimental ##ly once again . six n protein - binding peptide ##s , designated separately as s ##na ##1 , s ##na ##2 , s ##na ##4 , s ##na ##5 , s ##na ##9 and s ##ng ##11 , were selected for sequencing . sequence analysis suggested that s ##na ##5 shared approx ##ima ##tively 100 % sequence identity to s ##na ##4 , s ##na ##2 , s ##na ##9 and s ##na ##1 . in addition , the binding specific ##ity of the 15 - mer peptide ##s with the sar ##s - co ##v n protein was further demonstrated by blocking elisa using the synthetic ##al 15 - mer peptide according to the de ##duced amino acid sequence of s ##na ##5 . also , the de ##duced amino sequence of s ##na ##5 was compared with proteins in translated database using the tb ##las ##t ##x program , and the results showed that the proteins with the highest homo ##logy were u ##bi ##quin ##ol - cy ##to ##chrome c red ##uc ##tase iron - sulfur subunit ##s ( uc ##ri or u ##q ##cr ) , otherwise known as the ri ##es ##ke iron - sulfur proteins ( ri ##sp ) . notable ##ly , in the [ 2 ##fe - 2 ##s ] red ##ox centre of uc ##ri , there were 6 residues [ g ##g ##w ( y ) f ( y ) cp ] compatible to the residues ( position 2 ##→ ##7 , g ##g ##w ##fc ##p ##7 ) of the nh ##2 - terminal of the 15 - mer peptide , which indicated higher binding specific ##ity between the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v and the red ##ox centre of uc ##ri to some extent . here , the possible molecular mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v n protein in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s are discussed .  
beijing has been severely affected by sar ##s , and sar ##s - associated corona ##virus has been confirmed as its cause . however , clinical and experimental evidence imp ##lica ##tes the possibility of co - infection . in this report , re ##ov ##irus was isolated from throat sw ##ab ##s of sar ##s patients , including the first case in beijing and her mother . identification with the electron microscopy revealed the characteristic features of re ##ov ##irus . 24 of 38 samples from other sar ##s cases were found to have ser ##olo ##gic responses to the re ##ov ##irus . prime ##rs designed for re ##ov ##irus have amplified several fragments of dna , one of which was sequence ##d ( s ##2 gene fragment ) , which indicates it as a unique re ##ov ##irus ( or ##thor ##eo ##virus ) . preliminary animal experiment showed that in ##oc ##ulation of the re ##ov ##irus in mice caused death with at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . nevertheless , the association of re ##ov ##irus with sar ##s outbreak requires to be further investigated .  
sar ##s - co ##v , as the pathogen ##y of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , is a mystery that the origin of the virus is still unknown even a few isolate ##s of the virus were completely sequence ##d . to explore the genesis of sar ##s - co ##v , the f ##do ##d method previously developed by us was applied to comparing complete genome ##s from 12 sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s to those from 12 previously identified corona ##virus ##es and an un ##ro ##oted phylogenetic tree was constructed . our results show that all sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s were clustered into a cl ##ique and previously identified corona ##virus ##es formed the other cl ##ique . meanwhile , the three groups of corona ##virus ##es depart from each other clearly in our tree that is consistent with the results of pre ##ven ##ient papers . differently , from the topology of the phylogenetic tree we found that sar ##s - co ##v is more close to group 1 within genus corona ##virus . the topology map also shows that the 12 sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s may be divided into two groups determined by the association with the sar ##s - co ##v from the hotel m in hong kong that may give some information about the infectious relationship of the sar ##s .  
sar ##s corona ##virus is an rna virus whose replication is error - prone , which provides possibility for escape of host defenses , and even leads to evolution of new viral strains during the passage or the transmission . lots of variations have been detected among different sar ##s - co ##v strains . and a study on these variations is helpful for development of efficient vaccine . moreover , the test of nuclei ##c acid characterization and genetic stability of sar ##s - co ##v is important in the research of inactivated vaccine . the whole genome sequences of two sar ##s corona ##virus strains after passage in ve ##ro cell culture were determined and were compared with those of early passages , respectively . results showed that both sar ##s corona ##virus strains have high genetic stability , although nearly 10 generations were passed . four nu ##cle ##otide variations were observed between the second passage and the 11th passage of sino ##1 strain for identification of sar ##s inactivated vaccine . moreover , only one nu ##cle ##otide was different between the third passage and the 10th passage of sino ##3 strain for sar ##s inactivated vaccine . therefore , this study suggested it was possible to develop inactivated vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v in the future .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused tremendous damage to many asia countries , especially china . the transmission process and outbreak pattern of sar ##s is still not well understood . this study aims to find a simple model to describe the outbreak pattern of sar ##s cases by using sar ##s case data commonly released by governments . the outbreak pattern of cumulative sar ##s cases is expected to be a log ##istic type because the infection will be slowed down due to the increasing control effort by people and / or due to de ##ple ##tion of susceptible individuals . the increase rate of sar ##s cases is expected to decrease with the cumulative sar ##s cases , as described by the traditional logistical model , which is widely used in population dynamic studies . the instant ##aneous rate of increases were significantly and negatively correlated with the cumulative sar ##s cases in mainland of china ( including beijing , he ##bei , tianjin , shan ##xi , the autonomous region of inner mongolia ) and singapore . the basic reproduction number ##r ( 0 ) in asia ranged from 2 . 0 to 5 . 6 ( except for taiwan , china ) . the ##r ( 0 ) of he ##bei and tianjin were much higher than that of singapore , hong ##kong , beijing , shan ##xi , inner mongolia , indicating sar ##s virus might have originated differently or new mutations occurred during transmission . we demonstrated that the outbreak ##s of sar ##s in many regions of asia were well described by the log ##istic model , and the control measures implemented by governments are effective . the maximum instant ##aneous rate of increase , basic reproductive number , and maximum cumulative sar ##s cases were also calculated by using the log ##istic model .  
a novel corona ##virus has been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . for all the sar ##s - co ##v associated proteins der ##ivated from the sar ##s - co ##v genome , the ph ##ys ##io ##chemical properties such as the molecular weight , iso ##ele ##ctric point and extinction coefficient of each protein were calculated . the trans ##me ##mb ##rane segments and sub ##cellular local ##ization ( sub ##lo ##cation ) prediction and conserved protein motifs search against database were employed to analyze the function of sar ##s - co ##v proteins . also , the homo ##logy protein sequence alignment and evolutionary distance matrix calculation between sar ##s - co ##v associated proteins and the corresponding proteins of other corona ##virus ##es were employed to identify the classification and phylogenetic relationship between sar ##s - co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es . the results showed that sar ##s - co ##v is a novel corona ##virus which is different from any of the three previously known groups of co ##ron ##virus ##es , but it is closer to bo - co ##v and m ##h ##v than to other corona ##virus ##es . this study is in aid of experimental determination of sar ##s - co ##v pro ##te ##omics and the development of anti ##vira ##l vaccine .  
phylogenetic tree of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) including the human sar ##s - associated virus is reconstructed from complete genome ##s by using our newly developed k - string composition approach . the relation of the human sar ##s - co ##v to other corona ##virus ##es , i . e . the root ##ing of the tree is suggested by choosing an appropriate out ##group . sar ##s - co ##v makes a separate group closer but still distant from g ##2 ( co ##vs in mammalian host ) . the relation between different isolate ##s of the human sar ##s virus is in ##fer ##red by first constructing an ultra ##metric distance matrix from counting sequence variations in the genome ##s . the resulting tree is consistent with clinic relations between the sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s . in addition to a larger variety of corona ##virus genome ##s these results provide phylogenetic knowledge based on independent novel methodology as compared to recent phylogenetic studies on sar ##s - co ##v .  
we studied the infectious effect of sar ##s - co ##v virus on juvenile and adult brandt ’ s vol ##e ( micro ##tus brandt ##ii ) by nasal cavity spraying method ( cc ##id ( 50 ) is 10 ( 5 . 7 ) ) . sar ##s virus caused serious deaths in adults . the death adults demonstrated hem ##or ##rh ##age from mouth , nasal cavity and int ##est ##ine , hem ##or ##rh ##age ##ious inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia and gore in liver , sp ##leen and kidney . the survival adults demonstrated local hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c spot in lung and em ##phy ##se ##ma , but the other organs showed no path ##ological abnormal ##ity . sar ##s virus caused no deaths in juveniles , but loco ##mot ##ion of infected juveniles became slower . in the early stage , there was local pneumonia in lung and sar ##s viruses were isolated from the path ##ological tissue . only one control juvenile lived and the infected juvenile showed local pneumonia in lung . the results demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v infected brandt ’ s vol ##e seriously and adults were more su ##sc ##eptive to sar ##s - co ##v than juveniles . the brandt ’ s vol ##e may be a potential animal model for sar ##s research .  
corona ##virus has been determined to be the cause of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . human corona ##virus 229 ##e had been studied well and its receptor - binding domain was restricted to aa ##41 ##7 – 54 ##7 of s protein . however , this region has no homo ##logy with the newly separated sar ##s - associated virus ( hong kong isolate cu ##h ##k - w ##1 ) . then we analyzed the ph ##yl ##ogen ##esis of s ##1 subunit of the corona ##virus spike protein ( sar ##s - associated virus , hong kong isolate cu ##h ##k - w ##1 ) . interesting ##ly , the highest homo ##logy between mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) and sar ##s - associated corona ##virus was found . and the important sites ( aa ##6 ##2 – 65 and aa ##21 ##4 – 216 ) on the spike protein of m ##h ##v with receptor - binding capacity were highly conservative in comparison with the newly separated sar ##s - associated virus ( the corresponding sites are aa ##51 – 54 and aa ##l ##9 ##5 – 197 ) . these results from bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis might help us to study the receptor - binding sites of sar ##s - associated virus and the mechanism of the virus entry into the target cell , and design anti ##vira ##l drugs and potent vaccines .  
mer ##s - co ##v is an airborne disease which spreads easily and has high death rate . to predict and prevent mer ##s - co ##v , real - time analysis of user ’ s health data and his / her geographic location are fundamental . development of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution having benefits of better quality of service , reduced cost , scala ##bility , and flexibility . in this paper , an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predict ##s mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients using bay ##esian belief network and provides geographic - based risk assessment to control its outbreak . the proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0 . 2 million users . system provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographic - based risk assessment . the key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each mer ##s - co ##v users on google maps so that possibly infected users can be qu ##aran ##tine ##d as early as possible . it will help un ##in ##fect ##ed citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government agencies to manage the problem more effectively .  
to evaluate the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of inactivated sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , three groups of rabbits were im ##mun ##ized three times at 2 - week intervals with inactivated vaccine + ad ##ju ##vant , ad ##ju ##vant , and normal saline respectively . eight batch ##s of serum were sampled from the au ##ric ##ular vein at day 7 to day 51 , and specific i ##gg antibody ti ##ters and neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters were detected by indirect elisa and micro - cy ##top ##athic effect neutral ##izing test . antibody specific ##ity was identified by protein ##chi ##p ass ##ay . his ##top ##ath ##ological changes were detected by h & e stain ##ing . the results showed that , rabbits in the experimental group im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v all generated specific i ##gg antibodies with neutral ##izing activity , which suggested the inactivated sar ##s - co ##v could preserve its antigen ##ici ##ty well and eli ##cit an effective humor ##al immune responses . the peak ti ##ter value of specific i ##gg antibody and neutral ##izing antibody reached 1 : 40 ##9 ##60 and 1 : 256 ##0 respectively . in the experimental group , no obvious his ##top ##ath ##ological changes was detected in the h & e stained slides of heart , sp ##leen , kidney and test ##is samples , but the liver ##s had slight his ##top ##ath ##ological changes , and the lungs presented remarkable his ##top ##ath ##ological changes . these findings are of importance for sar ##s - co ##v inactivated vaccine development .  
rna viruses cause most of the dangerous com ##mun ##ica ##ble diseases . due to their high mutation rates , rna viruses quickly evade selective pressures and can adapt to a new host . therefore , new anti ##vira ##l approaches are urgently needed , which target more than one specific virus variant and which would optimal ##ly prevent development of viral resistance . among the family of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) , several human pathogen ##ic strains ( hc ##ov ) are known to cause respiratory diseases and are implied in enter ##ic diseases . while most strains contribute to common cold - like illnesses , others lead to severe infections . one of these viruses is the newly emerged ( 2012 ) , highly pathogen ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) of zoo ##not ##ic origin . mer ##s - co ##v causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate of 35 % . there is no specific treatment or infection prevention available . here , we show that the bacterial rib ##on ##uc ##lea ##se bin ##ase is able to inhibit the replication of mer ##s - co ##v and of the low - pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) in cell culture . we demonstrate that at non - toxic concentrations , bin ##ase decreased the ti ##ters of mer ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - 229 ##e . on a molecular level , bin ##ase treatment reduced ( i ) the viral sub ##gen ##omic rna ##s and ( ii ) the viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ##pro ##tein ( n ) and non - structural protein 13 ( ns ##p ##13 ) accumulation . furthermore , we show that the quantity of the replication / transcription complexes within the infected cells is diminished . thus , the data obtained might allow further development of new anti - corona ##vira ##l approaches affecting viral replication , independent of the specific virus strain .  
the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) is a major structural protein of corona ##virus ##es . the n protein of bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ( sl - co ##v ) has a high similarity with that of sar ##s - co ##v . in this study , the sl - co ##v n protein was expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli , pu ##rified and used as antigen . an indirect enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( indirect elisa ) was developed for detection of sar ##s - or sl - co ##v infections in bat populations . the detection of 57 ##3 bat sera with this indirect elisa demonstrated that sl - co ##vs consistently ci ##rc ##ulate in r ##hini ##lo ##phus species , further supporting the proposal that bats are natural reservoirs of sl - co ##vs . this method uses 1 – 2 μ ##l of serum sample and can be used for preliminary screening of infections by sar ##s - or sl - co ##v with a small amount of serum sample .  
sar ##s - co ##v is a newly discovery pathogen causing severe acute respiratory problems . it has been established that the s protein in this pathogen plays an important rule in the ads ##or ##ption and penetration of sar ##s - co ##v into the host cell by interaction with the ace ##2 receptor . to deter ##mina ##nt which functional motif of the s protein was involved in the interaction with ace ##2 , seven truncated s proteins deleted from the n or c terminal were obtained by an e . coli expression system and pu ##rified by column ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy to homo ##gen ##eit ##y . each truncated s protein was fixed on to the well of an elisa plate and an interaction was initiated with the ace ##2 protein . the ads ##or ##ption were quan ##ti ##fied by elisa , and the results indicated that amino acids from 38 ##8 to 49 ##6 of the s protein was responsible for the interaction with the ace ##2 receptor , and the interaction could be completely disrupted by an antibody specific to these amino acids . del ##eti ##ons adjacent to this domain did not appear to have a significant impact on the interaction with ace ##2 , suggesting that the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v could be developed as a vaccine to prevent the spread of sar ##s - co ##v .  
the et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was identified as a new corona ##virus , termed sar ##s - co ##v . establishment of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic system of sar ##s - co ##v genetic materials is crucial for sar ##s control . in this study , we quan ##ti ##fied sar ##s - co ##v mrna ##s in both infected cell culture l ##ys ##ate and in super ##nat ##ant by using real - time quantitative rev ##ere transcription - pc ##r based on eva ##gree ##n ##™ dye and ta ##q ##man - mg ##b probe ##s . for extensive evaluation of sen ##sit ##iv ##ities and specific ##ities , 13 pairs of prime ##rs and 4 probe ##s were designed based on different genes of sar ##s - co ##v . g ##ly ##cera ##lde ##hy ##des - 3 - phosphate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ( gap ##dh ) was selected as the internal control gene . results showed that s - gene - specific pc ##r was the most sensitive for detection , but because of its sequence variability in the different viral strains , prime ##rs and a probe based on the n gene were suitable substitution ##s . meanwhile , we found the mrna concentrations in cell culture l ##ys ##ates were much higher than in cell super ##nat ##ant and fa ##ci ##lite ##d more sensitive detection of the sar ##s - co ##v .  
the current diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) relies on laboratory - based tests since its clinical features are non ##sp ##ec ##ific , unlike other respiratory pathogen ##s . therefore , the development of a rapid and simple method for on - site detection of sar ##s - co ##v is crucial for the identification and prevention of future sar ##s outbreak ##s . in this study , a simple color ##ime ##tric and multiple ##x loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( lamp ) ass ##ay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . it can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real - time with fluorescent signals . the performance of this ass ##ay , based on six prime ##rs targeting open reading frame ( or ##f ##1 ##b ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) genes located in different regions of the sar ##s - co ##v , was compared with real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay using various concentrations of target genes . the detection limit of the lamp ass ##ay was comparable to that of real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay and therefore a few target rna to 10 ( 4 ) - 10 ( 5 ) copies could be detected within a short period of time ( 20 – 25 min ) . in addition , we established a multiple ##x real - time lamp ass ##ay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the sar ##s - co ##v genome . two target sequences were amplified by specific prime ##rs in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10 ( 5 ) copies . the standard curve had a linear relationship with similar amp ##li ##fication e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies . the lamp ass ##ay results in shorter “ sample - to - answer ” time than conventional pc ##r method . therefore , it is suitable not only for diagnosis of clinical test , but also for surveillance of sar ##s virus in developing countries . electronic supplementary material : supplementary material is available for this article at 10 . 100 ##7 / s ##13 ##20 ##6 - 01 ##9 - 340 ##4 - 3 and is accessible for authorized users .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v consists of s ##1 and s ##2 domains , which are responsible for virus binding and fusion , respectively . the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) positioned in s ##1 can specifically bind to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) on target cells , and ace ##2 regulates the balance between va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tors and va ##so ##di ##lat ##ors within the heart and kidney ##s . here , a rec ##om ##bina ##nt fusion protein containing 193 - amino acid rb ##d ( residues 318 – 510 ) and g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase were prepared for binding to target cells . additionally , mono ##cl ##onal rb ##d antibodies were prepared to confirm rb ##d binding to target cells through ace ##2 . we first confirmed that ace ##2 was expressed in various mouse cells such as heart , lungs , sp ##leen , liver , int ##est ##ine , and kidney ##s using a commercial ace ##2 poly ##cl ##onal antibody . we also confirmed that the mouse fi ##bro ##bla ##st ( ni ##h ##3 ##t ##3 ) and human embryo ##nic kidney cell lines ( he ##k ##29 ##3 ) expressed ace ##2 . we finally demonstrated that rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d bound to ace ##2 on these cells using a cellular enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay and im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y . these results can be applied for future research to treat ace ##2 - related diseases and sar ##s .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are a group of enveloped , single - stranded positive gen ##omic rna viruses and some of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) and the ongoing corona ##virus disease - 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . one key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells . in the last two decades , there is increasing understanding on the importance of the end ##oc ##ytic pathway and the auto ##pha ##gy process in viral entry and replication . as a result , the end ##oc ##ytic pathway including end ##oso ##me and l ##ys ##oso ##me has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combat ##ing diseases caused by co ##vs . in this mini - review , we will focus on the importance of the end ##oc ##ytic pathway as well as the auto ##pha ##gy process in viral infection of several pathogen ##ic co ##vs inclusive of sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and the new co ##v named as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes . such knowledge will provide important clues for control of the ongoing epidemic of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
the outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , has thus far killed over 3 , 000 people and infected over 80 , 000 in china and elsewhere in the world , resulting in catastrophe for humans . similar to its homo ##log ##ous virus , sar ##s - co ##v , which caused sar ##s in thousands of people in 2003 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism . however , co ##vid - 19 has lower severity and mortality than sar ##s but is much more trans ##missive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women . in response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease , this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject . we will cover the basics about the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , et ##iology , vi ##rol ##ogy , diagnosis , treatment , pro ##gno ##sis , and prevention of the disease . although many questions still require answers , we hope that this review helps in the understanding and era ##dication of the threatening disease .  
a newly identified novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is causing pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome across the world . ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , gen ##omics , and pathogen ##esis of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 show high homo ##logy with that of sar ##s - co ##v . current efforts are focusing on development of specific anti ##vira ##l drugs . therapeutic neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . here ##in , the host immune responses against sar ##s - co ##v discussed in this review provide implications for developing na ##bs and understanding clinical interventions against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . further , we describe the benefits , challenges and considerations of na ##bs against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . although many challenges exist , na ##bs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pan ##de ##mic and the possible re - emergence of the virus in the future , and their development therefore remains a high priority .  
an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel corona ##virus , currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , was reported recently . however , as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is an emerging virus , we know little about it . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the key events occurred during the early stage of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak , the basic characteristics of the pathogen , the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus . furthermore , we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pang ##olin ##s as the possible intermediate host of the virus , but their roles are waiting for further investigation . finally , the advances in the development of che ##mot ##her ##ape ##uti ##c options are also briefly summarized .  
mutation and adaptation have driven the co - evolution of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) and their hosts , including human beings , for thousands of years . before 2003 , two human co ##vs ( hc ##ov ##s ) were known to cause mild illness , such as common cold . the outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life - threatening an hc ##ov infection could be . the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in central china at the end of 2019 has thrust ##ed co ##vs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high trans ##mis ##sibility but reduced pathogen ##ici ##ty compared to its sister sar ##s - co ##v . hc ##ov infection is a zoo ##nosis and understanding the zoo ##not ##ic origins of hc ##ov ##s would serve us well . most hc ##ov ##s originated from bats where they are non - pathogen ##ic . the intermediate reservoir hosts of some hc ##ov ##s are also known . identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases . investigating co ##v - host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on co ##v pathogen ##esis in humans . in this review , we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven hc ##ov ##s , with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoo ##not ##ic origins and inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission . importantly , we compare and contrast the different hc ##ov ##s from a perspective of virus evolution and genome rec ##om ##bina ##tion . the current co ##v disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) epidemic is discussed in this context . in addition , the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted .  
currently , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , formerly known as 2019 - nc ##ov , the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) ) has rapidly spread across china and around the world , causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia . no specific anti - virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease . the supportive care and non - specific treatment to am ##eli ##ora ##te the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently . at the top of these conventional the ##ra ##pies , greater than 85 % of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected patients in china are receiving traditional chinese medicine ( tc ##m ) treatment . in this article , relevant published literature ##s are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of tc ##m in the treatment of co ##vid - 19 patients are analyzed . due to the homo ##logy in ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , gen ##omics , and pathogen ##esis of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v , and the widely use of tc ##m in the treatment of sar ##s - co ##v , the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of tc ##m in the treatment of patients with sar ##s corona ##vira ##l infections are discussed . current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of tc ##m , and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti - corona ##vira ##l activity are also introduced .  
various types of vaccines are under pre - clinical and clinical development to address the recent appearance of middle east respiratory syndrome or mer ##s , an emerging infectious disease that has already caused over 600 deaths and remains a threat to world health . the ca ##usa ##tive agent for this respiratory disease is a member of the beta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus , phylogenetic ##ally closely related to the sar ##s corona ##virus that caused an international health emergency in 2002 . with lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , and with und ##enia ##ble technological advances , vaccine development against mer ##s was initially fast - paced and has produced several dna and protein vaccine candidates with promising results during early pre - clinical testing . at least one vaccine candidate has even entered first - in - humans clinical trials now . with the number of mer ##s cases declining though and other infectious diseases attracting increased attention , the question remains , whether , similar to the situation after the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic , vaccine development is halted or remains the priority it rightful ##ly should .  
purpose of review : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 and is listed in the world health organization ’ s blue ##print of priority diseases that need immediate research . camel ##s are reservoirs of this virus , and the virus spill ##s over into humans through direct contact with camel ##s . human - to - human transmission and travel - associated cases have been identified as well . limited studies have characterized the molecular pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v . most studies have used ec ##top ##ic expression of viral proteins to character ##ize mer ##s - co ##v and its ability to mod ##ulate anti ##vira ##l responses in human cells . studies with live virus are limited , largely due to the requirement of high containment laboratories . in this review , we have summarized current studies on mer ##s - co ##v molecular pathogen ##esis and have mentioned some recent strategies that are being developed to control mer ##s - co ##v infection . recent findings : multiple anti ##vira ##l molecules with the potential to inhibit mer ##s - co ##v infection by disrupt ##ing virus - receptor interactions are being developed and tested . although human vaccine candidates are still being developed , a candidate camel vaccine is being tested for efficacy . combination of supportive treatment with inter ##fer ##on and anti ##vira ##ls is also being explored . summary : new anti ##vira ##l molecules that inhibit mer ##s - co ##v and host cell receptor interaction may become available in the future . additional studies are required to identify and character ##ize the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v em ##c / 2012 and other circulating strains . an effective mer ##s - co ##v vaccine , for humans and / or camel ##s , along with an efficient combination anti ##vira ##l therapy may help us prevent future mer ##s cases .  
over 1100 cases of mer ##s - co ##v have been reported since it was first identified in june 2012 . clinical presentation ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild illness to rapidly progressive disease with multi - organ failure and high mortality . treatment has been largely supportive . a large number of compounds have been shown to have significant in vitro inhibitor ##y activity against mer ##s - co ##v . until recently , mac ##aq ##ues were the only suitable animal models for animal studies , hind ##ering further clinical development of mer ##s - co ##v therapy . however , the recent successful development of mer ##s - co ##v infection model in trans ##duced mice offers opportunities to accelerate clinical development of therapeutic agents for mer ##s - co ##v infection . currently available evidence supports further clinical investigation of inter ##fer ##on - based treatment regime ##ns for patients with mer ##s - co ##v . combining inter ##fer ##on with my ##co ##ph ##eno ##late and / or high - dose rib ##avi ##rin appears especially promising . mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against various targets within mer ##s - co ##v spike protein have yielded encouraging in - vitro results . however , their safety and efficacy require confirmation in animal models and ex ##pl ##ora ##tory clinical trials .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerged infection in humans affecting the arabian peninsula , europe , and north africa . the source and persistence of the infection in humans remains unknown . the aim of this paper was to apply a risk analysis approach to the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v and to understand the source of ongoing infections . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v was reviewed and compared to sar ##s . each observed feature of mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology was summarized and fitted to either an epidemic or one of two sporadic scenarios ( either animal or deliberate release ) . as of may 2014 , mer ##s - co ##v has infected over 68 ##1 people and killed a further 204 over 2 years . in contrast , there were 8 , 273 cases and 77 ##5 deaths from sar ##s within 8 months . mer ##s - co ##v has a more sporadic pattern unlike the clear epidemic pattern seen with sar ##s , and an unusual concentration of cases in the middle east , without epidemic ##s in other countries to which it has spread . sar ##s , with a higher reproductive number ( r ##0 ) , was eliminated from humans within 8 months of emerging , yet mer ##s - co ##v , with a low r ##0 has persisted in humans over a far more prolonged period . this is at odds with the expected behavior of a virus with a low r ##0 , which theoretically should not persist unless there are ongoing introductions of infection into humans , and poses the question “ what is the source of continuing infections in humans ? ” a hospital outbreak in al ah ##sa , the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) , had a classic epidemic pattern with some human - to - human transmission . however , 3 different strains were identified in that outbreak , an unexpected and une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d finding for what appears to be a single source outbreak . since this outbreak in april 2013 , there has been a large increase in new cases , mainly in ks ##a in april and may 2014 , with no corresponding epidemic ##s in other countries . yet mer ##s - co ##v was present in ks ##a over several mass gatherings ( which pre ##dis ##pose to epidemic ##s ) , including the ha ##j ##j pilgrimage , without an epidemic arising . furthermore , although the virus has been identified in bats and camel ##s , the mode of ongoing transmission to humans remains uncertain . although some cases appear to be transmitted from human to human , and a few have animal or camel exposure , many cases have no history of contact with either animals or human cases . a high proportion of
background : human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) causes common cold , and is associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants , elderly and im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised patients . hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 is a member of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus that includes also the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ##es . both sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses . however , the ability of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 to ant ##ago ##nis ##e the intra ##cellular anti ##vira ##l defences has not yet been investigated . the objective of this study was to investigate the role of hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 structural ( membrane and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ) and accessory ( ns ##5 ##a and ns ##2 ##a ) proteins in the modulation of anti ##vira ##l gene expression profile in human embryo ##nic kidney 293 ( he ##k - 293 ) cells using pc ##r array analysis . methods : hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 membrane ( m ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , ns ##5 ##a and ns ##2 ##a mrna were amplified and clone ##d into the pac ##gf ##p ##1 - n expression vector ( cl ##onte ##ch ) , followed by trans ##fect ##ion in he ##k - 293 cells . expression of m , n , ns ##5 ##a and ns ##2 ##a proteins were confirmed by indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence test . three days post - trans ##fect ##ion , the cells were challenged by send ##ai virus . the human anti ##vira ##l response pc ##r array system ( qi ##age ##n ) was used to profile the anti ##vira ##l gene expression in he ##k - 293 cells , using the fold regulation comparison and the manual normal ##isation methods . results : around 50 – 60 genes were down ##re ##gul ##ated by hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 proteins , the most prominent genes being those critical for the activation of transcription factors involved in the anti ##vira ##l response like inter ##fer ##on regulatory factors ( ir ##fs ) and act ##iva ##tor protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) . among the most important down ##re ##gul ##ated genes were those coding for inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns ) mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ##s ( map ##ks ) , pro - ap ##op ##to ##tic and p ##yr ##op ##to ##tic proteins ( cas ##pas ##es , cat ##he ##ps ##ins , tu ##mour nec ##rosis factor ) , pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines ( inter ##le ##uki ##ns ) , pattern recognition receptors ( pr ##rs ; toll - like receptors and nod - like receptors ) and their
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a disease first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and it can be transmitted from human to human . this disease has spread to several other countries , most confirmed cases have displayed symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness and many of these patients have died . this research is aimed to construct a mathematical model for the transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in two areas by separating the human population into two groups ; susceptible and infectious groups . the dynamics of the disease is studied by a compartment ##al model involving ordinary differ ##rent ##ial equations . the basic reproductive number of this disease is discussed to control the outbreak of this disease . sensitivity analysis of this model is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the mer ##s - co ##v transmission .  
the first major pan ##de ##mic of the new millennium that arose from southern china in 2002 was of zoo ##not ##ic origin from wild game animals , called severe acute respiratory syndrome [ sar ##s ] . the cu ##lp ##rit was determined to be a corona ##virus of animal origin [ sar ##s - co ##v ] . the discovery of the sar ##s - co ##v , which caused an outbreak of > 800 ##0 people in > 30 countries with fatal ##ity of about 10 % , resulted in intense search for novel corona ##virus ##es with potentially high pathogen ##ici ##ty . ten years later after the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic , another novel corona ##virus crossed the species barrier from bats to humans through an intermediate camel host , to produce a severe lower respiratory infection labeled the middle east respiratory syndrome [ mer ##s ] . a novel corona ##virus [ mer ##s - co ##v ] was first identified in september 2012 , from patients who resided or traveled to saudi arabia . the mer ##s - co ##v spread through contacts with camel and subsequently from human to human via drop ##let transmission . mer ##s cases occurred in several other countries including in europe and the united states , mainly from residence or travel to the arabian peninsula , but was not of pan ##de ##mic potential . however , in the spring of 2015 , a mer ##s outbreak started in south korea which was initiated by a returning traveler from saudi arabia , and subsequently secondary infection of over 186 local residents occurred . recent estimate in may 2015 indicates that the mer ##s - co ##v have af ##flict ##ed 116 ##7 patients with mer ##s worldwide with 47 ##9 deaths [ 41 % fatal ##ity ] . thus mer ##s is more deadly than sar ##s but appears to be less con ##tag ##ious . however , unlike sar ##s which has not reappeared since 2002 – 2003 , mer ##s - co ##v have the potential to cause sporadic or local outbreak ##s for many years as the virus may now be en ##tre ##nched endemic ##ally in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s of the middle east .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##vs ) ( dr ##ost ##en et al . , 2003 ; f ##ou ##chi ##er et al . , 2003 ; pei ##ris et al . , 2003 ##b ; ks ##ia ##zek et al . , 2003 ) . the first known outbreak of sar ##s occurred in china ’ s guangdong province in november , 2002 ( chinese sar ##s molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology consortium , 2004 ) . by august 7 of the following year , sar ##s had spread to more than 30 countries , affecting 8 , 09 ##6 people and resulting in 77 ##4 deaths worldwide ( world health organization , 2004 ) . in 2003 , taiwan experienced a series of sar ##s outbreak ##s and the municipal hoping hospital ( referred to here ##af ##ter as hp ) in taipei city suffered the first and the most serious outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v nos ##oco ##mia ##l infections : 137 probable cases and 26 deaths ( division of surveillance and investigation , center for disease control , taiwan , 2003 ; lan et al . , 2005 ##b ) . according to the center for disease control ( cdc ) in taiwan , 36 ##4 of the 66 ##4 probable taiwanese sar ##s cases reported to the world health organization were confirmed by reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) and / or neutral ##izing antibody tests ( center for disease control , 2003 ##a ) . in this chapter , we will discuss the molecular and clinical ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of sar ##s infection in taiwan during 2003 .  
influenza , me ##as ##les , sar ##s , mer ##s , and smallpox illnesses are caused by highly infectious viral pathogen ##s that induce critical illness . these biological ##ly diverse viruses enter and replicate within host cells triggering viral - and host - mediated damage that results in pneumonia and multi ##org ##an failure in severe cases . early case identification and strict infection control limit healthcare transmission . va ##cci ##nation allowed smallpox era ##dication and limits global me ##as ##les and seasonal influenza mortality . while sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is no longer circulating , mer ##s - co ##v and zoo ##not ##ic influenza viruses , with pan ##de ##mic potential , remain persistent threats . supportive critical care is the main ##sta ##y of treatment for severe disease due to these viral infections .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome first emerged in guangdong , china in november 2002 and then spread rapidly to many countries through hong kong in 2003 [ 1 – 4 ] . a 64 - year - old physician from southern china , who had visited hong kong on february 21 , 2003 and died 10 days later of severe pneumonia , is believed to have been the source of infection causing subsequent outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in hong kong , vietnam , singapore , and canada [ 1 – 4 ] . by the end of the epidemic in july 2003 , there had been 8 , 09 ##6 cases reported in 29 countries and regions , with a mortality incidence of 77 ##4 ( 9 . 6 % ) [ 5 ] . among the 8 , 09 ##6 cases , 1 , 70 ##6 were health care workers ( hc ##ws ) . a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) was responsible for sar ##s [ 6 ] . bats are likely the natural reservoirs of sar ##s - like co ##v [ 7 , 8 ] .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel infectious disease in the new millennium . it has been as ##cer ##tained that a new corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v , is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s . while the extra ##ord ##ina ##rily rapid isolation and full genome sequencing of sar ##s - co ##v constituted a remarkable scientific achievement , identification of the actual animal reservoir ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v is more difficult . initial evidence ##s indicated that the masked palm ci ##vet ( pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta ) was the primary suspect of the animal origin of sar ##s ( gu ##an et al . , 2003 ; song et al . , 2005 ) . recent studies suggested that horseshoe bat is one of the real reservoirs ( lau et al . , 2005 ; li et al . , 2005 ) and masked palm ci ##vet may have only served as an intermediate amp ##li ##fication host for sar ##s - co ##v and fulfilled efficient inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission ( lau et al . , 2005 ) . this chapter will sum ##mar ##ize the studies on the animal reservoir ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v .  
a new disease , severe at ##yp ##ical respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , emerged in china in late 2002 and developed into the first epidemic of the 21st century . the disease was caused by an unknown animal corona ##virus ( co ##v ) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals , and was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent for sar ##s . this new co ##v not only became readily trans ##missible between humans but also was also more pathogen ##ic . the disease spread across the world rapidly due to the air travel , and infected 80 ##9 ##6 people and caused 77 ##4 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents . the disease is characterized by flu - like symptoms , including high fever , mala ##ise , cough , dia ##rr ##hea , and infiltrate ##s visible on chest radio ##graphy . the overall mortality was about 10 % , but varied profoundly with age ; the course of disease seemed to be mild ##er in the pediatric age group and resulted rarely in a fatal outcome , but the mortality in the elderly was as high as 50 % . aggressive qu ##aran ##tine measures taken by the health authorities have successfully contained and terminated the disease transmission . as a result there are no sar ##s cases recorded recently . nevertheless there is a possibility that the disease may emerge in the population with high vigor . significant progress has been made in understanding the disease biology , pathogen ##esis , development of animal models , and design and evaluation of different vaccines , and these are the focus of this chapter .  
corona ##virus ##es are enveloped rna viruses that in ##fect mammals and birds . infection of humans with globally circulating human corona ##virus ##es is associated with the common cold . in contrast , transmission of animal corona ##virus ##es to humans can result in severe disease : the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) are responsible for hundreds of deaths in asia and the middle east , respectively , and are both caused by members of the genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v that were zoo ##not ##ically transmitted from an animal host to humans . at present , neither vaccines nor specific treatment is available to combat corona ##virus infection in humans , and novel anti ##vira ##l strategies are urgently sought . the viral spike protein ( s ) media ##tes the first essential step in corona ##virus infection , viral entry into target cells . for this , the s protein critically depends on pri ##ming by host cell pro ##tea ##ses , and the responsible enzymes are potential targets for anti ##vira ##l intervention . recent studies revealed that the end ##osomal cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se cat ##he ##ps ##in l and the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses fur ##in and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 prime the s proteins of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v and provided evidence that successive s protein cleavage at two sites is required for s protein pri ##ming . moreover , mechanisms that control pro ##tea ##se choice were un ##rave ##led , and insights were obtained into which enzyme promotes viral spread in the host . here , we will provide basic information on s protein function and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic pri ##ming , and we will then discuss recent progress in our understanding of the pri ##ming of the s proteins of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v .  
infectious at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . clinical ##ly , it is characterized by fever , headache , muscular sore ##ness , fatigue , dry cough rarely with ph ##leg ##m , and dia ##rr ##hea . most patients experience accompanying pneumonia . in severe cases , the conditions may develop into acute lung injury , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , or even multiple organ failure that causes death . in china , sar ##s has been legally listed as one of the class b infectious diseases but is managed as class a infectious diseases , like ant ##hra ##x and human infection of av ##ian influenza .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was discovered for the first time in saudi arabia in 2012 . on a global scale 1200 infections have been registered with approximately 50 % resulting in a fatal outcome . it is currently not fully clear how mer ##s - co ##v is transmitted and insufficient research has so far been carried out . taking the sudden increase of cases in south korea into consideration , this article discusses which prevent ##ive measures should be recommended for international travelers in order to prevent infections . a literature search of the most recent publications indicated that appropriate standard hygiene measures are sufficient and no travel restrictions are therefore necessary .  
the following article gives a current overview of the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . since first time in summer 2012 in some countries in the arabian peninsula there were a number of severe infections of the respiratory tract caused by the new corona ##virus . the majority of cases of illness were reported from saudi arabia , in germany several imported cases of the disease have been reported . after beginning with flu - like - symptoms usually follows a pneumonia with a transition to an acute respiratory distress syndrome . the mortality rate is estimated at 55 % . in the travel medical advice it should be el ##uc ##ida ##ted about the disease and for that reason it is of great importance also for occupational medicine .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly identified infectious disease caused by a novel zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) with unknown animal reservoirs . the risk of sar ##s re ##eme ##rgen ##ce in humans remains high due to the large animal reservoirs of sar ##s - co ##v - like corona ##virus and the genome instability of rna corona ##virus ##es . an epidemic in 2003 affected more than 8 , 000 patients in 29 countries , with 10 % mortality . sar ##s infection is transmitted by air droplets . clinical and laboratory manifestation ##s include fever , chill ##s , rig ##or , my ##al ##gia , mala ##ise , dia ##rr ##hea , cough , d ##ys ##p ##no ##ea , pneumonia , l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia , th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia , and elevated serum lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase , alan ##ine amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se , and cr ##ea ##tine kinase activities . health care workers are a high - risk group , and advanced age is strongly associated with disease severity . treatment has been empirical , and there is no licensed sar ##s vaccine for humans so far . however , presence of long - lived neutral ##izing antibodies and memory t - and b - l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes in con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients raises hope for active im ##mun ##ization . furthermore , results from pre ##cl ##ini ##cal sar ##s vaccines expressing spike protein to eli ##cit neutral ##izing antibodies and cellular responses that are protective in mouse and non ##hum ##an primate models are encouraging . very little is known of the early events in viral clearance and the onset of innate and inflammatory responses during the sar ##s infection . regulation of the innate immune response is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and disease severity in sar ##s infection . notably , sar ##s - co ##v has evolved eva ##sive strategies to suppress anti ##vira ##l type i inter ##fer ##on responses in infected cells . in addition , inflammatory responses are characterized by up ##re ##gul ##ation of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es such as il - 6 , ip - 10 , and mc ##p - 1 in tissues and serum , and massive in ##filtration ##s of inflammatory cells such as macro ##pha ##ges in infected tissues . due to the lack of animal models that mimic the clinical manifestation ##s of human sar ##s infection for me ##chan ##istic study and vaccine evaluation , development of a safe prop ##hyl ##actic sar ##s vaccine for human use remains a huge challenge . this chapter is written to sum ##mar ##ize and highlight the latest clinical , ser ##ological , and im ##mun ##ological parameters relevant to the pathogen ##esis and protective immunity of sar ##s infection

the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a viral respiratory disease that is spreading worldwide nec ##ess ##itating to have an accurate diagnosis system that accurately predict ##s infections . as data mining class ##ifiers can greatly assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of diseases in general . in this paper , class ##ifier model performance for two classification types : ( 1 ) binary and ( 2 ) multi - class were tested on a mer ##s - co ##v data ##set that consists of all reported cases in saudi arabia between 2013 and 2017 . a cross - validation model was applied to measure the accuracy of the support vector machine ( sv ##m ) , decision tree , and k - nearest neighbor ( k - n ##n ) class ##ifiers . experimental results demonstrate that sv ##m and decision tree class ##ifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 86 . 44 % for binary classification based on healthcare personnel class . on the other hand , for multi ##class classification based on city class , the decision tree class ##ifier had the highest accuracy among the remaining class ##ifiers ; although it did not reach a satisfactory accuracy level ( 42 . 80 % ) . this work is intended to be a part of a mer ##s - co ##v prediction system to enhance the diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v disease .  
emerging pathogen ##s are either new or newly recognized or those that are increasing in incidence and spread . since the identity of emerging pathogen ##s from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict , the development for pathogen - specific therapeutic ##s and vaccines is problematic . the highly pathogen ##ic sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged from zoo ##not ##ic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . many patients with sar ##s - co ##v experienced an ex ##ace ##rba ##ted form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died . similar to other viral pathogen ##s like influenza and west nile virus , the severity of sar ##s - co ##v disease increased with age . unfortunately , successful va ##cci ##nation in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of im ##mun ##ological def ##iciencies associated with aging ( immune sen ##escence ) . due to the rapid ##ity of virus emergence , technologies like synthetic biology can be harness ##ed to facilitate rapid rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus construction for studying the novel virus biology , pathogen ##esis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions . since predicting the antigen ##ic identity of future emergence is difficult , candidate vaccines and therapeutic ##s should have a maximal breadth of cross - protection , and panels of antigen ##ically diver ##gent synthetic ##ally reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation . we discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human sar ##s - co ##v has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogen ##esis of viral diseases . in addition , we review the evolution , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , and pathogen ##esis of epidemic and zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutic ##s and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoo ##not ##ic pool .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of an acute respiratory disease causing at ##yp ##ical pneumonia and dia ##rr ##hea with high mortality . different types of sar ##s - co ##v vaccines , including non ##re ##pl ##icative and vector ##ed vaccines , have been developed . administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious and safe vaccines . nevertheless , the identification of side effects , prefer ##ential ##ly in the elderly animal models , indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems . live at ##ten ##uated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections . a limited number of sar ##s - co ##v at ##ten ##uating modifications have been described , including mutations , and partial or complete gene del ##eti ##ons affecting the replica ##se , like the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##p ##1 or ns ##p ##2 ) , or the structural genes , and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral sub ##gen ##omic mrna ##s . a promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on del ##eti ##on of the envelope e gene alone , or in combination with the removal of six additional genes none ##ssen ##tial for virus replication . viruses lacking e protein were at ##ten ##uated , grew in the lung , and provided homo ##log ##ous and het ##ero ##log ##ous protection . improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus ti ##ters using the power of viruses with mu ##tat ##or ph ##eno ##type ##s , while maintaining the at ##ten ##uated ph ##eno ##type . the safety of the live sar ##s - co ##v vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes ns ##p ##1 , ns ##p ##2 , and 3a , by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a vi ##ru ##lent ph ##eno ##type by rec ##om ##bina ##tion or re ##mo ##del ##ing of vaccine genome ##s based on cod ##on de ##op ##ti ##mi ##zation using synthetic biology . the newly generated vaccine candidates are very promising , but need to be evaluated in animal model systems that include young and aged animals .  
clinical presentation of sar ##s is non ##sp ##ec ##ific ; the important clinical findings in west nile virus infection are those associated with neurological complications . rapid and accurate diagnosis of sar ##s and west nile virus infection remains an important clinical challenge . older adults are at higher risk of complications , including death from sar ##s and west nile virus . at present , there is no effective therapy for these infections . although efforts are under way , there are presently no effective vaccines for sar ##s or west nile virus .  
background : on 31 december , 2019 , the world health organization china country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown ae ##ti ##ology . since then , there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( co ##vid - 19 ) , 2000 deaths , and over 14 000 cases recovered . outbreak ##s of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real - time public health action . in 2018 , we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . here , we review information available on co ##vid - 19 and provide an evidenced - based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak . methods : three bi ##bl ##io ##graphic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in the outbreak setting . studies were grouped thematic ##ally according to clinical research questions addressed . in february 2020 , available information on co ##vid ##19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v systematic review . results : from the research objectives for sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , ten themes in the literature were identified : clinical character ##isation , pro ##gno ##sis , diagnosis , clinical management , viral pathogen ##esis , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological character ##isation , infection prevention and control / transmission , su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , psycho ##so ##cial , and ae ##ti ##ology . for co ##vid ##19 , some information on clinical presentation , diagnostic testing , and ae ##ti ##ology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled . conclusions : based on a systematic review of other severe corona ##virus ##es , we sum ##mar ##ise the state of clinical research for co ##vid - 19 , highlight the research gaps , and provide recommendations for the implementation of standard ##ised protocols . data based on internationally standard ##ised protocols will inform clinical practice real - time .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are a large family of enveloped , positive - strand rna viruses . four human co ##vs ( hc ##ov ##s ) , the non - severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like hc ##ov ##s ( namely hc ##ov 229 ##e , nl ##6 ##3 , o ##c ##43 , and hk ##u ##1 ) , are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections . non - sar ##s - like co ##v can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major ( fatal ) epidemic ##s . in contrast , sar ##s like co ##vs ( namely sar ##s - co ##v and middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v ) can cause intense short - lived fatal outbreak ##s . the current epidemic caused by the highly con ##tag ##ious sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern . there is scan ##ty knowledge on the actual pan ##de ##mic potential of this new sar ##s - like virus . it might be speculated that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic is gross ##ly under ##dia ##gno ##sed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences : ( i ) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could ha ##pha ##zard ##ly occur linked to un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed index cases ; ( ii ) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low - level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity . understanding the role of pau ##cis ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic subjects and st ##rat ##ifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality . whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable , classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns . the emergence of yet another global epidemic under ##sco ##res the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and under ##sco ##res the need for global cooperation and prepared ##ness , even during inter - epidemic periods .  
the war in iraq , the threat of terrorism and the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic have made international business activities increasingly difficult and risky . the worldwide economic down ##turn and slow growth in domestic markets are forcing companies to depend more than ever on overseas trade . sar ##s emerged in china in november 2002 and has spread to 26 countries . the sar ##s epidemic has caused the most severe economic crisis in southeast asia since the wave of bank failures and currency dev ##al ##uation ##s that swept the region five years ago . the sar ##s epidemic has prompted health officials to implement travel advisor ##ies and restrictions , in order to def ##er none ##ssen ##tial travel to regions of asia with large numbers of sar ##s cases . they are enforcing qu ##aran ##tine and isolation measures in major cities to try and limit the spread of sar ##s . the president of the united states has signed an executive order adding sar ##s to the list of com ##mun ##ica ##ble diseases that can be qu ##aran ##tine ##d . a major disruption in china could para ##ly ##ze just ‐ in ‐ time supply chains and cause an economic crisis for retailers and other businesses worldwide . the sar ##s epidemic has caused many economists to drastically reduce their economic ‐ growth forecast ##s for asia . new infectious diseases , such as sar ##s , can emerge and easily travel around the globe , in ##fect ##ing less ‐ res ##ili ##ent hosts and mu ##tat ##ing because of the influence of viruses and bacteria in their new environment . health officials are even more concerned about the pan ##de ##mic disaster that hasn ’ t happened , but may still . however , the sar ##s epidemic has created positive economic benefits for some companies .  
the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its in ##ord ##inate ##ly rapid spread is posing severe challenges to the well ##bei ##ng of millions of people worldwide , health care systems and the global economy . while many younger people experience no or mild symptoms on infection , older adults are highly susceptible to life - threatening respiratory and systemic conditions which demand a full understanding and lever ##aging of knowledge of the differences between immunity in young and old people . consequently , we welcome papers addressing any issues relevant to immunity and age ##ing in the context of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and will endeavour to fast - track peer - review . we aim to provide a platform exclusively for discussions of individual and age differences in su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and immune responses to co ##vid caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and how to prevent or reduce severity of disease in older adults .  
the common mar ##mos ##et could be useful as a model organism for studying mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
a red fluorescent protein ( rf ##p ) - expressing , rec ##om ##bina ##nt , full - length , infectious cd ##na clone of mer ##s - co ##v could be used to character ##ize viral pathogen ##esis and screen for anti ##vira ##ls .  
mouse studies suggest a mutant form of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus could be used to va ##cci ##nate against the infection .  
crystal structures of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein in complex with its receptor could aid the development of therapeutic ##s and vaccines against the disease .  
human neutral ##izing mab ##s against mer ##s - co ##v could aid the development of new therapeutic ##s to treat or prevent infection .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are a large family of enveloped , single - stranded , zoo ##not ##ic rna viruses . four co ##vs commonly ci ##rc ##ulate among humans : hc ##ov ##2 - 229 ##e , - hk ##u ##1 , - nl ##6 ##3 and - o ##c ##43 . however , co ##vs can rapidly mu ##tate and rec ##om ##bine leading to novel co ##vs that can spread from animals to humans . the novel co ##vs severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 . the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease ( termed co ##vid - 19 ) in china and multiple other countries , threatening to cause a global pan ##de ##mic . in humans , co ##vs mostly cause respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms . clinical manifestation ##s range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bro ##nch ##itis , pneumonia , severe acute respiratory distress syndrome , multi - organ failure and even death . sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults , and are associated with much lower case - fatal ##ity rates . preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 but are less likely to be sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic or develop severe symptoms . however , the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain . children more often have gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms compared with adults . most children with sar ##s - co ##v present with fever , but this is not the case for the other novel co ##vs . many children affected by mer ##s - co ##v are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic . the majority of children infected by novel co ##vs have a documented household contact , often showing symptoms before them . in contrast , adults more often have a nos ##oco ##mia ##l exposure . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic , clinical and diagnostic findings , as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel co ##vs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children .  
sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) is known to be a promising target for development of therapeutic agents against the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . a qui ##no ##lino ##ne compound 1 was selected via virtual screening , and it was synth ##eti ##zed and tested for en ##zy ##matic inhibition in vitro . compound 1 showed potent inhibitor ##y activity ( ic ( 50 ) = 0 . 44 µ ##mo ##l / l ) toward sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) . further work on a series of qui ##no ##lino ##ne derivatives resulted in the discovery of the most potent compound 23 , inhibit ##ing sar ##s co ##v 3 ##cl ( pro ) with an ic ( 50 ) of 36 . 86 nm ##ol / l . the structure ‐ activity relationships were also discussed .  
the continued threat of emerging , highly lethal infectious pathogen ##s such as middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) calls for the development of novel vaccine technology that offers safe and effective prop ##hyl ##actic measures . here , a novel nano ##par ##tic ##le vaccine is developed to deliver subunit viral antigen ##s and sting ago ##nist ##s in a virus ‐ like fashion . sting ago ##nist ##s are first en ##cap ##sul ##ated into caps ##id ‐ like hollow polymer ##ic nano ##par ##tic ##les , which show multiple favorable attributes , including a ph ‐ responsive release profile , prominent local immune activation , and reduced systemic react ##ogenic ##ity . upon subsequent antigen con ##ju ##gation , the nano ##par ##tic ##les carry morphological se ##mb ##lance to native vi ##rion ##s and facilitate code ##li ##very of antigen ##s and sting ago ##nist ##s to draining l ##ym ##ph nodes and immune cells for immune potent ##iation . nano ##par ##tic ##le vaccine effectiveness is supported by the eli ##cit ##ation of potent neutral ##ization antibody and antigen ‐ specific t cell responses in mice im ##mun ##ized with a mer ##s ‐ co ##v nano ##par ##tic ##le vaccine candidate . using a mer ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ per ##missive trans ##genic mouse model , it is shown that mice im ##mun ##ized with this nano ##par ##tic ##le ‐ based mer ##s ‐ co ##v vaccine are protected against a lethal challenge of mer ##s ‐ co ##v without triggering und ##es ##ira ##ble e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . together , the bio ##com ##pati ##ble hollow nano ##par ##tic ##le described here ##in provides an excellent strategy for delivering both subunit vaccine candidates and novel ad ##ju ##vant ##s , enabling accelerated development of effective and safe vaccines against emerging viral pathogen ##s .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel human illness caused by a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed corona ##virus ( co ##v ) termed sar ##s ‐ co ##v . there are conflicting reports on the animal reservoir of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . many of the groups that argue car ##ni ##vor ##es are the original reservoir of sar ##s ‐ co ##v use a ph ##yl ##ogen ##y to support their argument . however , the ph ##yl ##ogen ##ies in these studies often lack out ##group and root ##ing criteria necessary to determine the origins of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . recently , sar ##s ‐ co ##v has been isolated from various species of chi ##rop ##tera from china ( e . g . , rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus ) thus leading to rec ##ons ##ider ##ation of the original reservoir of sar ##s ‐ co ##v . we evaluated the hypothesis that sar ##s ‐ co ##v isolated from chi ##rop ##tera are the original zoo ##not ##ic source for sar ##s ‐ co ##v by sampling sar ##s ‐ co ##v and non ‐ sar ##s ‐ co ##v from diverse hosts including chi ##rop ##tera , as well as car ##ni ##vor ##es , art ##io ##da ##ct ##yl ##s , rodents , birds and humans . regardless of alignment parameters , optimal ##ity criteria , or isolate sampling , the resulting ph ##yl ##ogen ##ies clearly show that the sar ##s ‐ co ##v was transmitted to small car ##ni ##vor ##es well after the epidemic of sar ##s in humans that began in late 2002 . the sar ##s ‐ co ##v isolate ##s from small car ##ni ##vor ##es in shenzhen markets form a terminal clade that emerged recently from within the radiation of human sar ##s ‐ co ##v . there is evidence of subsequent exchange of sar ##s ‐ co ##v between humans and car ##ni ##vor ##es . in addition sar ##s ‐ co ##v was transmitted independently from humans to farm ##ed pigs ( su ##s sc ##ro ##fa ) . the position of sar ##s ‐ co ##v isolate ##s from chi ##rop ##tera are basal to the sar ##s ‐ co ##v clade isolated from humans and car ##ni ##vor ##es . although sequence data indicate that chi ##rop ##tera are a good candidate for the original reservoir of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , the structural biology of the spike protein of sar ##s ‐ co ##v isolated from chi ##rop ##tera suggests that these viruses are not able to interact with the human variant of the receptor of sar ##s ‐ co ##v , ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . in sar ##s ‐ co ##v we study , both visually and statistical ##ly , lab ##ile gen ##omic fragments and , put ##ative key mutations of the spike protein that may be associated with host shifts .
cho ##les ##terol ‐ enriched micro ##dom ##ains known as lip ##id raft ##s have been shown to be important for the life cycle of several viruses . here , we investigated whether cho ##les ##terol is important during the initial steps of sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ‐ mediated entry . ve ##ro cells were treated with the cho ##les ##terol se ##quest ##ering drug methyl ‐ β ‐ cy ##cl ##ode ##xt ##rin ( m ##β ##cd ) and then exposed to sar ##s ‐ co ##v and ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s ‐ co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( vs ##v ‐ δ ##g ‐ s ) . furthermore , a cell ‐ based binding ass ##ay and a binding ass ##ay with soluble s protein demonstrated that the binding of s to its receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in ‐ converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is affected by cho ##les ##terol de ##ple ##tion and that multi ‐ ligand interactions might be important for the entry process of sar ##s ‐ co ##v to target cells . con ##fo ##cal laser microscopy studies and a membrane fl ##ota ##tion ass ##ay in ve ##ro cells show that the sar ##s ‐ co ##v receptor is organized within lip ##id micro ##dom ##ains and cho ##les ##terol de ##ple ##tion results in a reduction of ace ##2 in the bu ##oya ##nt deter ##gent resistant membrane fraction after tri ##ton ‐ x 100 sol ##ub ##ili ##zation . further attempts are directed to understand the molecular role of cho ##les ##terol during the initial steps of sar ##s ‐ co ##v life cycle .  
background : globally , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) is a newly emerging virus that causes sar ##s with high mortality rate in infected people . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) ‐ associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of sar ##s and the detection of diseases . here , a new quantum dots ( q ##ds ) ‐ con ##ju ##gated rna apt ##ame ##r with high sensitivity and rapid ##ity is proposed for the detection of sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein using an on chip system . results : a q ##ds ‐ con ##ju ##gated rna apt ##ame ##r can specifically hybrid ##ize on the im ##mo ##bil ##ized sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein on the surface of a glass chip . detection is based on the optical signal variation of a q ##ds ‐ supported rna apt ##ame ##r interacting on an im ##mo ##bil ##ized protein chip . using an optical q ##ds ‐ based rna apt ##ame ##r chip , sar ##s n protein was detected at concentrations as low as 0 . 1 pg ml ( − ##1 ) . conclusions : it was demonstrated that the q ##ds ‐ con ##ju ##gated rna apt ##ame ##r could interact on a designed chip specifically and sensitive ##ly . this device could form a q ##ds ‐ con ##ju ##gated bio ##sen ##sor prototype chip for sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein diagnosis . the proposed visual sar ##s ‐ co ##v n protein detection technique may avoid the limitations of other reported methods because of its high sensitivity , good specific ##ity , ease of use , and the ability to perform one ‐ spot monitoring . copyright © 2011 society of chemical industry 
background : since december 2019 , an outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid ‐ 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 ) in wu ##han , china , has become a public health emergency of international concern . the high fatal ##ity of aged cases caused by sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 was a need to explore the possible age ‐ related phenomena with non ‐ human primate models . methods : three 3 ‐ 5 years old and two 15 years old r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues were intra ##tra ##che ##ally infected with sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 , and then analyzed by clinical signs , viral replication , chest x ‐ ray , his ##top ##ath ##ological changes and immune response . results : viral replication of nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s , anal sw ##ab ##s and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 challenge . monkeys developed typical inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia characterized by thick ##ened al ##ve ##olar sept ##um accompanied with inflammation and ed ##ema , notably , old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia . viral antigen ##s were detected mainly in al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells and macro ##pha ##ges . conclusion : sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 caused more severe inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys . r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue models infected with sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 provided insight into the pathogen ##ic mechanism and facilitated the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s against sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 infection .  
an effective sar ##s vaccine is likely to include components that can induce specific cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t ‐ cell ( ct ##l ) responses . the specific ##ities of such responses are governed by h ##la ‐ restricted presentation of sar ##s ‐ derived peptide ep ##ito ##pes . exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigen ##s would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from gen ##omic / pro ##te ##omic sequence information . the latter was recently established when a ca ##usa ##tive corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) was isolated and full ‐ length sequence ##d . here , we have combined advanced bio ##in ##form ##atics and high ‐ through ##put im ##mun ##ology to perform an h ##la super ##type , genome ‐ wide scan for sar ##s ‐ specific cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t cell ep ##ito ##pes . the scan includes all nine human h ##la super ##type ##s in total covering > 99 % of all major human populations . for each h ##la super ##type , we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in bio ##chemical ‐ binding ass ##ays . at this time ( approximately 6 months after the genome was established ) , we have tested the majority of the h ##la super ##type ##s and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates . these should be further valid ##ated in sar ##s survivors and used for vaccine formulation . we suggest that im ##mun ##ob ##io ##in ##form ##atics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design .  
recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic around the world is associated with ‘ severe acute respiratory syndrome ’ ( sar ##s - co ##v ##2 ) in humans . sar ##s - co ##v ##2 is an enveloped virus and e proteins present in them are reported to form ion channels , which is mainly associated with pathogen ##esis . thus , there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels , which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by sar ##s - co ##v ##2 in humans . considering this , in the present study , authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human ‘ sar ##s - co ##v ##2 e ’ protein as well as its interaction with various ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als . result obtained revealed that α - helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition , which in turn mod ##ulate ion channel activity ; thereby aiding the pathogen ##esis caused via sar ##s - co ##v ##2 in human and other ve ##rte ##brates . however , after binding with bela ##chin ##al , mac ##af ##lav ##ano ##ne e , and vi ##bs ##ano ##l b , the random motion of the human ‘ sar ##s - co ##v ##2 e ’ protein gets reduced , this , in turn , inhibit ##s the function of the ‘ sar ##s - co ##v ##2 e ’ protein . it is per ##tine ##nt to note that two amino acids , namely val ##25 and ph ##e ##26 , play a key role while interacting with these three ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als . as these three ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als , namely , bela ##chin ##al , mac ##af ##lav ##ano ##ne e & vi ##bs ##ano ##l b , have passed the ad ##met ( absorption , distribution , metabolism , ex ##cre ##tion and toxicity ) property as well as ‘ lip ##inski ’ s rule of 5 ##s ’ , they may be utilized as drugs in controlling disease caused via sar ##s - co ##v ##2 , after further investigation . communicated by rama ##sw ##amy h . sar ##ma 
[ image : see text ] corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , previously called 2019 - nc ##ov ) . based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection , the world health organization ( who ) has classified the co ##vid - 19 outbreak as a pan ##de ##mic . because no specific drugs or vaccines for co ##vid - 19 are yet available , early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak . here , we report a field - effect trans ##isto ##r ( fe ##t ) - based bio ##sen ##sing device for detecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in clinical samples . the sensor was produced by coating graph ##ene sheets of the fe ##t with a specific antibody against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein . the performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein , culture ##d virus , and nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens from co ##vid - 19 patients . our fe ##t device could detect the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 f ##g / ml in phosphate - buffer ##ed saline and 100 f ##g / ml clinical transport medium . in addition , the fe ##t sensor successfully detected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in culture medium ( limit of detection [ lo ##d ] : 1 . 6 × 10 ( 1 ) p ##fu / ml ) and clinical samples ( lo ##d : 2 . 42 × 10 ( 2 ) copies / ml ) . thus , we have successfully fabricated a promising fe ##t bio ##sen ##sor for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; our device is a highly sensitive im ##mun ##ological diagnostic method for co ##vid - 19 that requires no sample pre ##tre ##at ##ment or labeling .  
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused severe damage to the world . with the support of classic evolutionary theories and population genetics principles , many studies on the origin of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have revealed encouraging results but meanwhile some are still under debate . we are concerned with the validity of applying classic evolutionary theories and formula to the evolution of rna viruses . we have raised several con ##fo ##und ##ing factors like the rna replication feature and the rna modification systems of the hosts , which might je ##opa ##rdi ##ze the validity of the application of classic methods to analyze the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 data .  
the sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spike protein is a target of intensive research , as it is a major vi ##ru ##lence factor . trans ##fect ##ion of sar ##s - co ##v spike into ve ##ro e ##6 , he ##k ##29 ##3 ##t and h ##l - c ##z cells leads to strong expression of the g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted spike protein , as shown by western b ##lot analyses and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent imaging using spike - specific human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies , indicating the potential utility of these antigen ##s and antibodies as diagnostic re ##age ##nts . furthermore , we employed cd ##na micro ##ar ##ray analysis to probe the changes in host gene transcription attributed to trans ##fect ##ion of a cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed spike construct into the h ##l - c ##z cell line of mono ##cy ##te lineage that is linked to im ##mun ##ological responses . a diverse representation of 100 genes displayed altered transcription ##al patterns in response to sar ##s - co ##v spike expression , with 61 up ##re ##gul ##ated and 39 down ##re ##gul ##ated genes . genes involved in intra ##cellular trafficking , signaling , modulation or transcription were generally up ##re ##gul ##ated . in contrast , genes involved in cell metabolism and cy ##tos ##kel ##eto ##n formation were notably down ##re ##gul ##ated . the transcript ##s of other functional categories exhibited varied responses to sar ##s - co ##v spike trans ##fect ##ion . collectively , our analyses el ##uc ##ida ##te numerous and complex transcript ##omic events that occur in response to spike protein expression and that contribute towards sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging virus that may lead to severe acute respiratory illness frequently associated with multi ##org ##an failure and death . the objective of this chapter is to sum ##mar ##ize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathogen ##esis , clinical manifestation ##s , diagnosis , management and outcomes of mer ##s - co ##v infection focusing on the critically ill .  
both types of cell death , namely nec ##rosis and ap ##op ##tosis , are found in organs of sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infected patients . the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract , however , although also a target for sar ##s - co ##v replication , is obviously not affected by cell death mechanisms . such differences in cell death induction are parallel ##ed by in - vitro studies . in a colon - derived cell line ( ca ##co - 2 ) , pro ##ap ##op ##to ##tic proteins were down - and anti ##ap ##op ##to ##tic proteins were up ##re ##gul ##ated during sar ##s - co ##v infection . by contrast , in sar ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells , ap ##op ##tosis was induced via the p ##38 map ##k and cas ##pas ##e dependent pathways . both ap ##op ##to ##tic pathways , although mostly the intrinsic signal trans ##duction , can be targeted by structural as well as accessory proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . the fact that all structural and most of the accessory proteins of sar ##s - co ##v are implicated in ap ##op ##to ##tic scenarios indicates the fundamental role of ap ##op ##tosis in the sar ##s - co ##v life cycle . interesting ##ly , at least for the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v , a cell - type specific manipulation of ap ##op ##tosis was confirmed .  
as in other corona ##virus ##es , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein is one of the core components of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . it ol ##igo ##mer ##izes to form a closed capsule , inside which the gen ##omic rna is securely stored thus providing the sar ##s - co ##v genome with its first line of defense from the harsh conditions of the host environment and aiding in replication and propagation of the virus . in addition to this function , several reports have suggested that the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein mod ##ulates various host cellular processes , so as to make the internal mil ##ieu of the host more con ##du ##ci ##ve for survival of the virus . this article will analyze and discuss the available literature regarding these different properties of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . towards the end of the article , we will also discuss some recent reports regarding the possible clinical ##ly relevant use of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , as a candidate diagnostic tool and vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality . a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been shown to be the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s . the typical clinical feature associated with sar ##s is diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage in lung , and lung fi ##bro ##sis is evident in patients who died from this disease . the mechanisms by which sar ##s - co ##v infection causes lung fi ##bro ##sis are not fully understood , but transforming growth factor - β ( t ##gf - β ) and ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) - mediated lung fi ##bro ##sis are among the most documented ones . the activation of the t ##gf - β / sm ##ad pathway is critical to lung fi ##bro ##sis . sar ##s - co ##v infection not only enhance ##s the expression of t ##gf - β , but also facilitates its signaling activity . the sar ##s - co ##v receptor ace ##2 is a negative regulator of lung fi ##bro ##sis , and sar ##s - co ##v infection decreases ace ##2 expression . therefore , sar ##s - co ##v infection may lead to lung fi ##bro ##sis through multiple signaling pathways and t ##gf - β activation is one of the major contributors .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a respiratory illness with variable symptoms that was recognized as the first near - pan ##de ##mic infectious disease of the twenty - first century . a novel human corona ##virus , named sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , derived from sar ##s patients was reported as the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of sar ##s . studying the signaling pathways of sar ##s - infected cells is key to understanding the molecular mechanism of sar ##s viral infection . cell death is observed in culture ##d ve ##ro e ##6 cells after sar ##s - co ##v infection . from sar ##s - co ##v infection to cell death , p ##38 mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) is a key participant in the determination of cell death and survival . two signaling pathways comprising signal trans ##du ##cer and act ##iva ##tor of transcription 3 ( stat ##3 ) and p ##90 rib ##osomal s ##6 kinase ( p ##90 ##rsk ) are downstream of p ##38 map ##k . ak ##t and j ##nk ( jun nh ( 2 ) - terminal kinase ) signaling pathways are important to establish persistent infection of sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . expression studies of sar ##s - co ##v proteins indicate that the viral proteins are able to activate signaling pathways of host cells . the study of signaling pathways in sar ##s - co ##v patients is difficult to perform compared with in vitro studies due to the effects of the human immune system . this review highlights recent progress in character ##izing signal trans ##duction pathways in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells in vitro and in vivo .  
a novel corona ##virus was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the lung disease severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the outbreak of sar ##s in 2002 / 2003 was associated with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality and sparked international research efforts to develop anti ##vira ##l strategies . many of these efforts focus ##sed on the viral surface protein spike ( s ) , which facilitates the first ind ##is ##pen ##sable step in the viral replication cycle , infectious entry into target cells . for infectious cellular entry to occur , the s protein must engage a cellular receptor , the car ##box ##ype ##pt ##ida ##se ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the interface between ace ##2 and s protein , which has been characterized at the structural level , constitutes a key target for vaccines and inhibitors , and is believed to be an important deter ##mina ##nt of viral pathogen ##esis and inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission . in this chapter , we will discuss how sar ##s - s media ##tes cellular entry and we will review the implications of this process for sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) transmission , disease development and anti ##vira ##l intervention .  
corona ##virus spikes have the largest mass of any known viral spike molecule . the spike is a type 1 viral fusion protein , a class of trim ##eric surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein proteins from diverse viral families that share many common structural and functional characteristics . fusion proteins are mainly responsible for host cell receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion , and may perform other roles such as virus assembly and release via bud ##ding . the conform ##ation ##al changes that occur in the spike of intact sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) when it binds to the viral receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) are described . clues to the structural / functional relationships of membrane fusion have been made possible by the development of viral purification and ina ##ct ##ivation methods , along with cry ##o - electron microscopy ( cry ##o - em ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) image processing of many different images containing multiple views of the spikes . these methods have allowed study of the spikes while still attached to vi ##rion ##s that are non ##in ##fect ##ious , but fusion ##ally competent . the receptor - binding and fusion core domains within the sar ##s - co ##v spike have been precisely localized within the spike . receptor binding results in structural changes that have been observed in the spike molecule , and these appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion . a working model for the step ##wise process of receptor binding , and subsequent membrane fusion in sar ##s - co ##v is presented . uniquely , the large size of the sar ##s - co ##v spike allows structural changes to be observed by cry ##o - em in the native state . this provides a useful model for studying the basic process of membrane fusion in general , which forms an essential part of the function of many cellular processes .  
the database here described contains data of integrated surveillance for the “ corona ##virus disease 2019 ” ( abbreviated as co ##vid - 19 by the world health organization ) in italy , caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the database , included in a main folder called co ##vid - 19 , has been designed and created by the italian civil protection department , which currently manages it . the database consists of six folder ##s called ‘ are ##e ’ ( containing charts of geographical areas interested by containment measures ) , ‘ dat ##i - and ##ament ##o - nazi ##onale ’ ( containing data relating to the national trend of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread ) , ‘ dat ##i - j ##son ’ ( containing data that sum ##mar ##ize the national , provincial and regional trends of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread ) , ‘ dat ##i - province ’ ( containing data relating to the provincial trend of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread ) , ‘ dat ##i - region ##i ’ ( containing data relating to the regional trend of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread ) and ‘ sc ##hed ##e - ri ##ep ##ilo ##gative ’ ( containing summary sheets relating to the provincial and regional trends of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread ) . the italian civil protection department daily receives data by the italian ministry of health , analyze ##s them and updates the database . thus , the database is subject to daily updates and integration ##s . the database is freely accessible ( cc - by - 4 . 0 license ) at https : / / gi ##th ##ub . com / pc ##m - d ##pc / co ##vid - 19 . this database is useful to provide insight on the spread mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , to support organizations in the evaluation of the efficiency of current prevention and control measures , and to support governments in the future prevention decisions .  
in this perspective , we recommend universal mask ##ing of the us public during corona ##virus disease 2019 due to the high con ##tag ##ious ##ness of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , viral shed ##ding of viable sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals , and the likely contribution of mask ##ing to core di ##stan ##cing public health strategies for curb ##ing transmission .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the virus responsible for the corona ##virus disease of 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . first identified in wu ##han ( hub ##ei , china ) in december of 2019 , it has since been declared a pan ##de ##mic by the world health organization in march of 2020 . in this study , we will provide a brief review of viral origin , identification , symptoms , transmission , diagnosis , and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) belong to the family of corona ##vir ##idae , the order ni ##do ##vira ##les , and the genus corona ##virus . they are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal infections . morphological ##ly , co ##vs are enveloped viruses containing a non - segment ##ed positive - sense , single - stranded rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( rna ) viruses . co ##vs are categorized into four important genera that include alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus , beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , gamma ##cor ##ona ##virus , and delta ##cor ##ona ##virus . a novel member of human co ##v that has recently emerged in wu ##han , china , is now formally named as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ) . this is a unique strain of rna viruses that have not been previously observed in humans . the virus has wide host adapt ##ability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans , masked palm ci ##vet ##s , mice , dogs , cats , camel ##s , pigs , chickens , and bats . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 typically causes respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal sickness in both humans and animals . it can be transmitted through aero ##sol ##s and direct / indirect contact , as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling . specific structural proteins , which might be found on the surface of the virus , play an important role in the pathogen ##esis and development of the complications . the disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever , chill ##s , cough , and short ##ness of breath or difficulty in breathing . the infected people may also present with other symptoms such as dia ##rr ##hea , my ##al ##gia , fatigue , expect ##oration , and hem ##op ##ty ##sis . it is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country , which is major ##ly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease . since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus , supportive management and treatment with non - specific therapeutic agents ( rep ##ur ##posed drugs ) may provide relief to the patients . some prevent ##ive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections , di ##sin ##fect ##ion of instruments used during medical case handling , using personal protective equipment , proper and early diagnosis of the disease , avoiding contact with the sick patients , and qu ##aran ##tine of the infected / exposed people .  
background : since its discovery in december 2019 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has infected more than 2 180 000 people worldwide and has caused more than 150 000 deaths as of april 16 , 2020 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which is the virus causing corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , uses the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as a cell receptor to invade human cells . thus , ace ##2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . this study is to investigate the ace ##2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods : we compared ace ##2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger ( ages ≤ 49 years ) and older ( ages > 49 years ) persons using two - sided student ’ s t test . we also investigated the correlation ##s between ace ##2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using pearson ’ s correlation test . results : ace ##2 expression levels were the highest in the small int ##est ##ine , test ##is , kidney ##s , heart , thyroid , and adi ##pose tissue , and were the lowest in the blood , sp ##leen , bone marrow , brain , blood vessels , and muscle . ace ##2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs , colon , liver , bladder , and ad ##ren ##al gland . ace ##2 was not differential ##ly expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue . in the skin , digest ##ive system , brain , and blood vessels , ace ##2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females . in the thyroid and lungs , ace ##2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females , respectively , and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups , respectively . conclusions : our data indicate that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may in ##fect other tissues aside from the lungs and in ##fect persons with different sexes , ages , and races equally . the different host immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection may partially explain why males and females , young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity . this study provides new insights into the role of ace ##2 in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic .  
objective : to analyze the evolution and variation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 during the epidemic starting at the end of 2019 . methods : we downloaded the full - length genome sequence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from the databases of gi ##sai ##d and nc ##bi . using the software for bio ##in ##form ##atics including mega - x , beast , and tempest , we constructed the gen ##omic evolution tree , in ##fer ##red the time evolution signal of the virus , calculated the t ##m ##rca time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution . results : the phylogenetic tree showed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 belonged to the sar ##be ##co ##virus subgenus of β corona ##virus genus together with bat corona ##virus beta ##co ##v / bat / yunnan / rat ##g ##13 / 2013 , bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 , bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 and sar ##s - co ##v . the gen ##omic sequences of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average t ##m ##rca time of 73 days ( 95 % ci : 38 . 9 - 119 . 3 days ) . no positive time evolution signal was found between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and beta ##co ##v / bat / yunnan / rat ##g ##13 / 2013 , but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 and sar ##s - co ##v . the major cause for mutations of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic . conclusion : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may have emerged as early as november , 2019 , originating most likely from bat - associated corona ##virus . this finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus .  
objective : to evaluate the effects of heat ina ##ct ##ivation of blood samples at [UNK] for 30 min on the results of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibody detection using different methods . methods : this retrospective study was conducted in 11 patients with established diagnosis of co ##vid - 19 and 10 patients with diseases other than co ##vid - 19 in our hospital . we collected samples of serum , plasma and whole blood from each patient between february , 12 and 18 , 2020 , and with a double - blind design , the samples were examined for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies before and after heat ina ##ct ##ivation at 56 [UNK] for 30 min . in all the samples , the total sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies were detected using im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphy , and the i ##gm antibodies were detected using flu ##orescence im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphy ; the i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y . we compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi - quantitative detection results of i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies before and after heat ina ##ct ##ivation of the samples . results : with im ##mun ##o - ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy , the coincidence rate of the total sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibody detection before and after heat ina ##ct ##ivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90 . 0 % in co ##vid - 19 cases and 100 . 0 % in the negative cases , resulting in a total coincidence rate 95 . 2 % ; for the whole blood samples , the total coincidence rates of the total sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies were 100 . 0 % . for detection of i ##gm antibodies in the serum , plasma and whole blood samples using flu ##orescence im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphy , the coincidence rates in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after ina ##ct ##ivation were 100 . 0 % , 0 and 47 . 6 % , respectively . for detection of serum i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies and plasma i ##gg antibodies with che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y , the coincidence rates in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after ina ##ct ##ivation were all 100 . 0 % , and the total coincidence rate of plasma i ##gm antibodies was 95 . 2 % . pearson correlation analysis of the semi - quantitative results of i ##gm and i ##gg detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0 . 999 ##9 ( 95 % ci : 0 . 999 ##8 -
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a significant emerging infectious disease . humans infected with the et ##iol ##ogical agent , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , primarily present with p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis but may also develop he ##pati ##c , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal , and renal pathology . we in ##oc ##ulated common mar ##mos ##ets ( call ##ith ##rix ja ##cc ##hus ) with the objective of developing a small non ##hum ##an primate model of sar ##s . two groups of c . ja ##cc ##hus were in ##oc ##ulated intra ##tra ##che ##ally with cell culture super ##nat ##ant containing sar ##s - co ##v . in a time course pathogen ##esis study , animals were evaluated at 2 , 4 , and 7 days after infection for morphological changes and evidence of viral replication . all animals developed a multi ##fo ##cal mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cell inter ##sti ##tial p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis , accompanied by multi ##nu ##cle ##ated sync ##yt ##ial cells , ed ##ema , and bro ##nch ##iol ##itis in most animals . viral antigen localized primarily to infected al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges and type - 1 p ##ne ##um ##ocytes by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry . viral rna was detected in all animals from pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at nec ##rop ##sy . viral rna was also detected in tr ##ache ##ob ##ron ##chia ##l l ##ym ##ph node and my ##oca ##rdi ##um , together with inflammatory changes , in some animals . he ##pati ##c inflammation was observed in most animals , predominantly as a multi ##fo ##cal l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##ytic hepatitis accompanied by nec ##rosis of individual he ##pa ##to ##cytes . these findings identify the common mar ##mos ##et as a promising non ##hum ##an primate to study sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
abstract since the first case of human infection by the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia in june 2012 , more than 226 ##0 cases of confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection and 80 ##3 related deaths have been reported since the 16th of october 2018 . the vast majority of these cases ( 71 % ) were reported in saudi arabia but the epidemic has now spread to 27 countries and has not ceased 6 years later , unlike sar ##s - co ##v that disappeared a little less than 2 years after emerging . due to the high fatal ##ity rate observed in mer ##s - co ##v infected patients ( 36 % ) , much effort has been put into understanding the origin and path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of this novel corona ##virus to prevent it from becoming endemic in humans . this review focuses in particular on the origin , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical manifestation ##s of mer ##s - co ##v , as well as the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients . the experience gained over recent years on how to manage the different risks related to this kind of epidemic will be key to being prepared for future outbreak ##s of com ##mun ##ica ##ble disease .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) first appeared in guangdong province , china , in november 2002 . although virus isolation and ser ##ology were useful early in the sar ##s outbreak for dia ##gno ##sing new cases , these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a bs ##l - 3 laboratory and ser ##oco ##n ##version is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection . the first qu ##ali ##tative reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction tests for sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalent ##s . these ass ##ays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real - time ass ##ays that helped el ##uc ##ida ##te the natural history of sar ##s , particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract . the unique natural history of sar ##s - co ##v infection di ##cta ##tes the testing of both respiratory and non ##res ##pi ##rator ##y specimens , the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient , and sending out positive ##s to be confirmed by a reference laboratory . commercially available reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction tests for sar ##s have recently appeared ; however , meaningful evaluation ##s of these ass ##ays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined . these and other issues related to diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v infection are discussed in this review .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was primarily detected in 2012 and still causing disease in human and camel . camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human . although , significant information related to mer ##s - co ##v disease , spread , infection , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical features have been published , a little information is available on the sequence diversity of spike protein gene . the spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells . recently , the information about rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v has been published . so , this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus in jed ##dah , saudi arabia . methods in this study samples were collected from both human and camel ##s and the spike protein gene was amplified and sequence ##d . the nu ##cle ##otide and amino acid sequences of mer ##s - co ##v spike protein gene were used to analyze the rec ##om ##bina ##tion , genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from saudi arabia . results the nu ##cle ##otide sequence identity ranged from 65 . 7 % to 99 . 8 % among all the samples collected from human and camel ##s from various locations in the kingdom . the lowest similarity ( 65 . 7 % ) was observed in samples from mad ##ina ##h and dam ##ma ##m . the phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolate ##s from various locations . the sample collected from human in jed ##dah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from bu ##ray ##dah , while camel sample formed a closed cluster with hu ##fu ##f isolate ##s . the phylogenetic tree by using amino ##ac ##id sequences formed closed cluster with dam ##ma ##m , ma ##kka ##h and dub ##a isolate ##s . the amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28 / 35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nu ##cle ##otide ##s sequences variations were observed in the spike protein gene . the minor rec ##om ##bina ##tion events were identified in eight different sequences at various hot ##sp ##ots in both human and camel samples using rec ##om ##bina ##tion detection programme . conclusion the generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the mer ##s - co ##v disease spread in not only in the kingdom but also globally .  
at the time of writing this commentary ( february 2020 ) , the corona ##virus co ##vid - 19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the sar ##s and mer ##s corona ##virus epidemic ##s combined . therapeutic ##s that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed . developing vaccines against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus may take many months . moreover , vaccines based on viral - encoded peptide ##s may not be effective against future corona ##virus epidemic ##s , as virus mutations could make them futile . indeed , new influenza virus strains emerge every year , requiring new im ##mun ##izations . a tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutic ##s , which would likely be resistant to new corona ##virus mutations , is to use available ang ##iot ##ens ##in receptor 1 ( at ##1 ##r ) block ##ers , such as los ##art ##an , as therapeutic ##s for reducing the aggressive ##ness and mortality from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus infections . this idea is based on observations that the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) very likely serves as the binding site for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the strain implicated in the current co ##vid - 19 epidemic , similarly to strain sar ##s - co ##v implicated in the 2002 - 2003 sar ##s epidemic . this commentary elaborate ##s on the idea of considering at ##1 ##r block ##ers as tentative treatment for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , and proposes a research direction based on data ##mini ##ng of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility .  
a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , emerged in wu ##han , hub ##ei province in china in december 2019 and caused a serious type of pneumonia called corona ##virus disease 2019 or co ##vid - 19 . this epidemic quickly spread across china and extended to more than 20 other countries . this commentary discusses the reasons for the fast spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in three aspects : the infectious sources , including the biological nature of the virus ; the susceptible population ; and the transmission routes . the current situations and suggestions regarding the control of the disease are summarized . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
from the beginning of 2002 and 2012 , severe respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) crossed the species barriers to in ##fect humans caused thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths , respectively . currently , a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) causes the outbreak ##s of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) was discovered . until february 18 , 2020 , there are 72 ##53 ##3 confirmed co ##vid - 19 cases ( including 106 ##44 severe cases ) and 1872 deaths in china . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is sur ##ging in the public and caused substantial burden ##s due to its human - to - human transmission . however , the intermediate host of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is still unclear . finding the possible intermediate host of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic . in this study , we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of corona ##virus spike protein and the host receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the interaction between the key amino acids of s protein rb ##d and ace ##2 indicated that like previous suggested pang ##olin ##s and snacks , the turtles ( c . pic ##ta bell ##ii , c . my ##das , and p . sin ##ensis ) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to human . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like corona ##virus sequences were identified in two separate cd ##na pools . the first pool was from a cara ##ssi ##us aura ##tus ( cr ##usia ##n carp ) cell line and the second was from ct ##eno ##pha ##ryn ##go ##don id ##ella ( grass carp ) head kidney tissue . blast analysis suggests that these sequences belong to sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es , and that they aren ' t evolution ##ari ##ly conserved in other species . investigation of the submit ##ting laboratories revealed that two laboratories from the institute of hydro ##biology at the chinese academy of sciences in wu ##han , china performed the research and submitted the cd ##na libraries to gen ##bank . this institution is very close in proximity to the wu ##han south china seafood wholesale market where sar ##s - co ##v - 2 first amplified in the human population . it is possible that these sequences are an artifact of the bio ##in ##form ##atics pipeline that was used . it is also possible that sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es are a common environmental pathogen in the region that may be in aquatic habitats . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
background : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes . in this study , a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogen ##ic aspects of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the changes in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in comparison with the two prior major co ##v epidemic ##s , sar ##s and mer ##s corona ##virus ##es . methods : the genome composition , nu ##cle ##otide ##s analysis , cod ##on usage indices , relative synonymous cod ##ons usage ( res ##u ) and effective number of cod ##ons ( en ##c ) were anal ##yse ##d in the four structural genes ; spike ( s ) , envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) genes , and two of the most important non - structural genes comprising rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) and main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , beta - co ##v from pang ##olin ##s , bat sar ##s , mer ##s and sar ##s co ##vs . these genes include spike ( s ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , en ##vel ##op ( e ) and membrane ( m ) genes . results : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 prefers p ##yr ##imi ##dine rich cod ##ons to pu ##rine ##s . most high - frequency cod ##ons were ending with a or t , while the low frequency and rare cod ##ons were ending with g or c . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 structural proteins showed 5 - 20 lower en ##c values , compared with sar ##s , bat sar ##s and mer ##s co ##vs . this implies higher cod ##on bias and higher gene expression efficiency of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 structural proteins . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased cod ##ons . pang ##olin beta - co ##v showed little differences with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 en ##c values , compared with sar ##s , bat sar ##s and mer ##s co ##v . conclusion : extreme bias and lower en ##c values of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , especially in spike , envelope and mp ##ro genes , are suggest ##ive for higher gene expression efficiency , compared with sar ##s , bat sar ##s and mer ##s co ##vs . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
currently there is no effective anti ##vira ##l therapy for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury . here , we discuss the various mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v - mediated inflammation . we also assume that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses . potential therapeutic tools to reduce sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block fc ##r activation . in the absence of a proven clinical fc ##r block ##er , the use of intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin to block fc ##r activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury . such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti - inflammatory drugs or co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids . however , these strategies , as proposed here , remain to be clinical ##ly tested for effectiveness .  
over the past 20 years , several corona ##virus ##es have crossed the species barrier into humans , causing outbreak ##s of severe , and often fatal , respiratory illness . since sar ##s - co ##v was first identified in animal markets , global vi ##rom ##ics projects have discovered thousands of corona ##virus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions . unfortunately , there are few tools available to functional ##ly test these viruses for their ability to in ##fect humans , which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoo ##not ##ic viral outbreak . here , we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage b beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , such as sar ##s - co ##v and the recent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , for receptor usage and their ability to in ##fect cell types from different species . we show that host pro ##tea ##se processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage b viruses and that bypass ##ing this barrier allows several lineage b viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor . we also demonstrate how different lineage b viruses can rec ##om ##bine to gain entry into human cells , and confirm that human ace ##2 is the receptor for the recently emerging sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
as the world is witnessing the epidemic of co ##vid - 19 , a disease caused by a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , emerging genetics and clinical evidence ##s suggest a similar path to those of sar ##s and mer ##s . the rapid gen ##omic sequencing and open access data , together with advanced vaccine technology , are expected to give us more knowledge on the pathogen itself , including the host immune response as well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future . this review aims to provide a comparative view among sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and the newly epidemic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in the hope to gain a better understanding of the host - pathogen interaction , host immune responses , and the pathogen immune eva ##sion strategies . this predict ##ive view may help in designing an immune intervention or prevent ##ive vaccine for co ##vid - 19 in the near future .  
last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life - threatening human pathogen ##s including ni ##pa ##h , e ##bola , chi ##ku ##ng ##un ##ya , z ##ika , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and more recently novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov or sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the disease condition associated with novel corona ##virus , referred to as corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) . the emergence of novel corona ##virus in 2019 in wu ##han , china marked the third highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus in ##fect ##ing humans in the 21st century . the continuing emergence of corona ##virus ##es at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy . ironically , even after a decade of research on corona ##virus , still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat corona ##virus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post - exposure prop ##hyl ##ax ##is to prevent future epidemic ##s . several clinical , genetic and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological features of co ##vid - 19 resemble sar ##s - co ##v infection . hence , the research advancement ##s on sar ##s - co ##v treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogen ##esis and develop effective therapeutic / prop ##hyl ##actic agents to treat and prevent this infection . mono ##cl ##onal antibodies represent the major class of bio ##ther ##ape ##uti ##cs for passive im ##mun ##oth ##era ##py to fight against viral infection . the therapeutic potential of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases . here , we sum ##mar ##ize the potential mono ##cl ##onal antibody based therapeutic intervention for co ##vid - 19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against similar corona ##virus ##es sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . further research on co ##vid - 19 pathogen ##esis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti - viral ##s against this newly emerging pathogen .  
objective : human infections with zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus contain emerging and re ##eme ##rg ##ing pathogen ##ic characteristics which have raised great public health concern . this study aimed at investigating the global prevalence , biological and clinical characteristics of novel corona ##virus , wu ##han china ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection outbreak ##s . materials and methods : the data on the global outbreak of 2019 - nc ##ov , sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v were obtained from world health organization ( who ) , centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , concerned ministries and research institutes . we also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in is ##i web of science and research centers on the prevalence , biological and clinical characteristics of 2019 - nc ##ov , sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v . results : worldwide , sar ##s - co ##v involved 32 countries , with 84 ##22 confirmed cases and 91 ##6 ( 10 . 87 % ) casualties from november 2002 to august 2003 . mer ##s - co ##v spread over 27 states , causing 249 ##6 cases and 86 ##8 ( 34 . 77 % ) fatalities during the period april 2012 to december 2019 . however , the novel corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries . it infected 34 ##7 ##9 ##9 people and resulted in 72 ##4 ( 2 . 08 % ) casualties during the period december 29 , 2019 to february 7 , 2020 . the fatal ##ity rate of corona ##virus mer ##s - co ##v was ( 34 . 77 % ) higher than sar ##s - co ##v ( 10 . 87 % ) and 2019 - nc ##ov ( 2 . 08 % ) ; however , the 2019 - nc ##ov transmitted rapidly in comparison to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . conclusions : the novel corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov has diverse ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and biological characteristics , making it more con ##tag ##ious than sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . it has affected more people in a short time period compared to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , although the fatal ##ity rate of mer ##s - co ##v was higher than sar ##s - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov . the major clinical manifestation ##s in corona ##virus infections 2019 - nc ##ov , mer ##s - co ##v , and sar ##s co ##v are fever , chill ##s , cough , short ##ness of breath , generalized my ##al ##gia , mala
we report co - infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and influenza a virus in a patient with pneumonia in china . the case highlights possible co - detection of known respiratory viruses . we noted low sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which could further com ##pl ##icate recognition of the full extent of disease .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are rna viruses that have become a major public health concern since the severe acute respiratory syndrome - co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) outbreak in 2002 . the continuous evolution of corona ##virus ##es was further highlighted with the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome - co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak in 2012 . currently , the world is concerned about the 2019 novel co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) that was initially identified in the city of wu ##han , china in december 2019 . patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness . the number of cases has been mounting since then . as of late february 2020 , tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in china alone , in addition to thousands of cases in other countries . although the fatal ##ity rate of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is currently lower than sar ##s - co ##v , the virus seems to be highly con ##tag ##ious based on the number of infected cases to date . in this review , we discuss structure , genome organization , entry of co ##vs into target cells , and provide insights into past and present outbreak ##s . the future of human co ##v outbreak ##s will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve , but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat .  
since december 2019 , corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , an emerging infection disease occurred in wu ##han , has spread in the mainland china . the epidemic factors on the basis of knowledge of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were discussed in this paper . this puts a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a novel corona virus , the onset of co ##vid - 19 is slow , and the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 remains unclear and may lead to multiple organ damage . these put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care . source of infection including the patients , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carrier and patients in the inc ##uba ##tion period are con ##tag ##ious . it is difficult to control source of infection . routes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission are diversified and the main routes of transmission for co ##vid - 19 are drop ##let transmission and close contact transmission . all population have su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . social factors such population movements and aggregation accelerated the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the chinese government ' s adopted measures are positive and effective , and are accepted by the expert group from the world health organization . however , it will be a long - term hard work in the future to seriously sum ##mar ##ize and think deeply to achieve public health security in china .  
the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov in wu ##han , hub ##ei province of china , at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to china ' s public health and clinical treatment . the virus belongs to the β genus corona ##virus in the family co ##ror ##na ##vir ##idae , and is closely related to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , causing severe symptoms of pneumonia . the virus is transmitted through droplets , close contact , and other means , and patients in the inc ##uba ##tion period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons . according to current observations , 2019 - nc ##ov is weaker than sar ##s in pathogen ##esis , but has stronger transmission competence ; it ' s mechanism of cross - species spread might be related with ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme [UNK] ( ace ##2 ) , which is consistent with the receptor sar ##s - co ##v . after the outbreak of this disease , chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic re ##age ##nts , identifying the characters of the pathogen , screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus , and are rapidly developing vaccines . the emergence of 2019 - nc ##ov reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic corona ##virus surveillance network . it also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research .  
the recent outbreak of respiratory illness in wu ##han , china is caused by a novel corona ##virus , named 2019 - nc ##ov , which is genetically close to a bat - derived corona ##virus . 2019 - nc ##ov is categorized as beta genus corona ##virus , same as the two other strains - severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . anti ##vira ##l drugs commonly used in clinical practice , including ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e inhibitors ( os ##elt ##ami ##vir , para ##mi ##vir , za ##nami ##vir , etc . ) , gan ##cic ##lov ##ir , ac ##y ##cl ##ov ##ir and rib ##avi ##rin , are invalid for 2019 - nc ##ov and not recommended . drugs are possibly effective for 2019 - nc ##ov include : re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r , lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r combined with inter ##fer ##on - β , con ##vale ##scent plasma , and mono ##cl ##onal antibodies . but the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019 - nc ##ov pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerging viral disease with fatal outcomes . however , no mer ##s - co ##v - specific treatment is commercially available . given the absence of previous structure - based drug discovery studies targeting mer ##s - co ##v fusion proteins , this set of compounds is considered the first generation of mer ##s - co ##v small molecule fusion inhibitors . after a virtual screening campaign of 1 . 56 million compounds followed by cell - cell fusion ass ##ay and mer ##s - co ##v plaques inhibition ass ##ay , three new compounds were identified . compound numbers 22 , 73 , and 74 showed ic ( 50 ) values of 12 . 6 , 21 . 8 , and 11 . 12 µ ##m , respectively , and were most effective at the onset of spike - receptor interactions . the compounds exhibited safe profiles against human embryo ##nic kidney cells 293 ( he ##k ##29 ##3 ) at a concentration of 20 µ ##m with no observed toxicity in ve ##ro cells at 10 µ ##m . the experimental results are accompanied with predicted favorable ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic des ##cript ##ors and drug - likeness parameters . in conclusion , this study provides the first generation of mer ##s - co ##v fusion inhibitors with pot ##encies in the low micro ##mo ##lar range .  
abstract background the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , is a global public health emergency . data on the effect of co ##vid - 19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series . objectives to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . study des ##igh clinical records were retrospective ##ly reviewed for 116 pregnant women with co ##vid - 19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in china between january 20 and march 24 , 2020 . evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in am ##nio ##tic fluid , cord blood , and neon ##atal ph ##ary ##nge ##al sw ##ab samples . results the median ge ##station ##al age on admission was 38 + 0 ( iq ##r 36 + 0 - 39 + 1 ) weeks . the most common symptoms were fever ( 50 . 9 % , 59 / 116 ) and cough ( 28 . 4 % , 33 / 116 ) ; 23 . 3 % ( 27 / 116 ) patients presented without symptoms . abnormal radio ##logic findings were found in 96 . 3 % ( 104 / 108 ) of cases . there were eight cases ( 6 . 9 % , 8 / 116 ) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths . one of eight patients ( 1 / 8 ) that presented in the first - and early - second - trim ##ester had a missed spontaneous abortion . twenty - one of 99 patients ( 21 . 2 % , 21 / 99 ) that had delivered had pre ##ter ##m birth , including six with pre ##ter ##m premature ru ##pt ##ured of membranes . the rate of spontaneous pre ##ter ##m birth before 37 weeks was 6 . 1 % ( 6 / 99 ) . there was one case of severe neon ##atal as ##phy ##xia that resulted in neon ##atal death . eighty - six of the 100 neon ##ates that had testing for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 had negative results , of these ten neon ##ates had paired am ##nio ##tic fluid and cord blood samples that were tested negative for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . conclusions sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous pre ##ter ##m birth . there is no evidence of vertical transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection when the infection manifest ##s during the third - trim ##ester of pregnancy .  
abstract a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread rapidly throughout china , europe and usa . the pneumonia might evolve in ar ##ds requiring assisted mechanical - ventilation . the prolonged im ##mo ##bil ##ization combined with respiratory failure , sep ##sis and de ##hy ##dra ##tion might expose sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / patients to increased risk of com ##plication including pulmonary em ##bol ##ism . we report the first case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 complicated by massive pulmonary em ##bol ##ism underwent successfully surgical em ##bol ##ect ##omy . we believe that maintaining the same pro - active attitude suggested by current guidelines might help in reducing morality and improving survival in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / patients .  
abstract the new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) outbreak from december 2019 in wu ##han , hub ##ei , china , has been declared a global public health emergency . ang ##iot ##ens ##in i converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , is the host receptor by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to in ##fect human cells . although ace ##2 is reported to be expressed in lung , liver , stomach , ile ##um , kidney and colon , its expressing levels are rather low , especially in the lung . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may use co - receptors / auxiliary proteins as ace ##2 partner to facilitate the virus entry . to identify the potential candidates , we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co - expression spectrum of 51 reported rna virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins . consistent with other recent reports , we confirmed that ace ##2 was mainly expressed in lung at ##2 , liver cho ##lang ##io ##cy ##te , colon colon ##ocytes , es ##op ##ha ##gus ke ##rat ##ino ##cytes , ile ##um ec ##s , rec ##tum ec ##s , stomach ep ##ith ##elial cells , and kidney pro ##xi ##mal tub ##ules . intriguing ##ly , we found that the candidate co - receptors , manifest ##ing the most similar expression patterns with ace ##2 across 13 human tissues , are all pep ##ti ##das ##es , including an ##pe ##p , d ##pp ##4 and en ##pe ##p . among them , an ##pe ##p and d ##pp ##4 are the known receptors for human co ##vs , suggesting en ##pe ##p as another potential receptor for human co ##vs . we also conducted “ cell ##phone ##db ” analysis to understand the cell cross ##talk between co ##v - targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues . we found that macro ##pha ##ges frequently communicate with the co ##vs targets through che ##mo ##kin ##e and ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis signaling , highlighting the importance of tissue macro ##pha ##ges in immune defense and immune pathogen ##esis .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v - 2 causes the recent global co ##vid - 19 public health emergency . ace ##2 is the receptor for both sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . to predict the potential host range of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we analyzed the key residues of ace ##2 for recognizing s protein . we found that most of the selected mammals including pets ( dog and cat ) , pang ##olin and ci ##rce ##tidae mammals remained the most of key residues for association with s protein from sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the interaction interface between cat / dog / pang ##olin / chinese ham ##ster ace ##2 and sar ##s - co ##v / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein was simulated through homo ##logy modeling . we identified that n ##8 ##2 in ace ##2 showed a closer contact with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein than m ##8 ##2 in human ace ##2 . our finding will provide important insights into the host range of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and a new strategy to design an opt ##imi ##zed ace ##2 for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is spreading globally and quickly , leading to emerging health issues . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enters into and in ##fect ##s host cells through its spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein recognizing the cell receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ii ( ace ##2 ) . here , we noticed that ace ##2 was further enhanced by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . human ge ##rm cells and early embryo ##s express high level of ace ##2 . notably , rna - se ##q result showed that reduction of h ##3 ##k ##27 ##me ##3 , but not h ##3 ##k ##4 / 9 / 36 ##me ##3 , led to up ##re ##gul ##ation of ace ##2 expression in mouse ge ##rm cell line g ##c - 2 . in agreement with this result , we found in human embryo ##nic stem cells that ace ##2 expression was significantly increased in absence of e ##zh ##2 , the major enzyme cat ##aly ##zing h ##3 ##k ##27 ##me ##3 . chip - se ##q analysis further confirmed decrease of h ##3 ##k ##27 ##me ##3 signal and increase of h ##3 ##k ##27 ##ac signal at ace ##2 promoter upon e ##zh ##2 knockout . therefore , we propose that e ##zh ##2 - mediated h ##3 ##k ##27 ##me ##3 at ace ##2 promoter region inhibit ##s ace ##2 expression in mammalian cells . this regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues . our discovery provides clues for pathogen ##esis and targeted drug therapy towards ace ##2 expression for prevention and ad ##ju ##vant therapy of co ##vid - 19 .  
summary the world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pan ##de ##mic novel beta corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the pathogen is spread by human - to - human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer , causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases , but critical illness , bilateral viral pneumonia , and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) in a minority . currently , controlling infection to prevent the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used . the pace of transmission and global scale of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections has implications for strategic oversight , resource management , and responsive ##ness in infection control . this article presents a summary of learning points in ep ##ide ##mi ##ological infection control from the sar ##s epidemic , alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the vi ##rol ##og ##ic and environmental contamination properties of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pan ##de ##mic context and how the risk of transmission by and to ana ##est ##het ##ists , int ##ens ##ivist ##s , and other healthcare workers can be mini ##mise ##d .  
abstract background the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna by real - time reverse transcription – polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of co ##vid - 19 by molecular diagnostic laboratories . we developed a multiple ##x rr ##t - pc ##r methodology for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . methods three genes were used for multiple ##x rr ##t - pc ##r : the sar ##be ##co ##virus specific e gene , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific n gene , and the human ab ##l ##1 gene as an internal control . results good correlation of c ##q values was observed between the simple ##x and multiple ##x rr ##t - pc ##r method ##ologies . low copies ( < 25 copies / reaction ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna were detected by the novel multiple ##x rr ##t - pc ##r method . conclusion the proposed multiple ##x rr ##t - pc ##r methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna , reducing re ##age ##nt use and cost , and time required by clinical laboratory technicians .  
abstract this paper continues a recent study of the spike protein sequence of the co ##vid - 19 virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . it is also in part an introductory review to relevant computational techniques for tack ##ling viral threats , using co ##vid - 19 as an example . q - u ##el tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bio ##in ##form ##atics tools were again used for efficiency , but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus . sub ##se ##que ##nce k ##rs ##fied ##ll ##f ##nk ##v of the s ##2 ′ spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage site continues to appear important . here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold corona ##virus ##es , av ##ian corona ##virus ##es and possibly as traces in the ni ##do ##virus ##es of reptiles and fish . its function or functions thus seem important to the corona ##virus ##es . it might represent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 achilles ’ heel , less likely to acquire resistance by mutation , as has happened in some early sar ##s vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper . preliminary conform ##ation ##al analysis of the receptor ( ace ##2 ) binding site of the spike protein is carried suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved , it appears to be more variable than k ##rs ##fied ##ll ##f ##nk ##v . however compounds like em ##od ##in that inhibit sar ##s entry , apparently by binding ace ##2 , might also have functions at several different human protein binding studies . the enzyme 11 ##β - hydro ##xy ##ster ##oid de ##hy ##dro ##genase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets , and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and ali ##ment ##ary tract . perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibit ##ing the de ##hy ##dro ##genase , but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets .  
abstract as of march 24 , 2020 , novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has been responsible for 37 ##9 , 66 ##1 infection cases with 16 , 42 ##8 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly . here ##in , we presented four critically ill patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection who received supportive care and con ##vale ##scent plasma . although all the four patients ( including a pregnant woman ) recovered from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection eventually , random ##ized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of con ##vale ##scent plasma therapy .  
abstract in as short as 3 months , co ##vid - 19 has spread and ravaged the world in an unprecedented speed in modern history rival ##ing the 1918 flu pan ##de ##mic . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the cu ##lp ##rit virus , is highly con ##tag ##ious and stable in the environment and predominantly transmit ##s among humans via the respiratory route . acc ##um ##ulating evidence suggest that this virus , like many of its related viruses , may also be an enter ##ic virus that can spread via the fe ##cal - oral route . such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapid ##ity and proliferation of this pan ##de ##mic . here we briefly sum ##mar ##ize what is known about this family of viruses and literature basis of the hypothesis that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is capable of in ##fect ##ing the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract and shed ##ding in the environment for potential human - to - human transmission .  
abstract alarms periodically emerge for viral pneumonia infections due to corona ##virus . in all cases , these are zoo ##nos ##es passing the barrier between species and in ##fect humans . the legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified corona ##virus , named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( previously called 2019 - nc ##ov ) , has a quite high mortality rate , around 2 % , and a strong ability to spread , with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2 . even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pan ##de ##mic , the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine . for this purpose , the means of bio ##in ##form ##atics , applied in the context of reverse - va ##cci ##nology paradigm , can be of fundamental help to select the most promising peptide ##s able to trigger an effective immune response . in this short report , using the concept of null ##ome ##r and introducing a distance from human self , we provide a list of peptide ##s that could deserve experimental investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) originally arose as part of a major outbreak of respiratory disease centered on hub ##ei province , china . it is now a global pan ##de ##mic and is a major public health concern . taxonomic ##ally , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was shown to be a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( lineage b ) closely related to sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - related bat corona ##virus ##es , and it has been reported to share a common receptor with sar ##s - co ##v ( ace - 2 ) . subsequently , beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es from pang ##olin ##s were identified as close relatives to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we perform structural modeling of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v , despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module . compared to sar ##s - co ##v and all other corona ##virus ##es in beta ##cor ##ona ##virus lineage b , we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding ( s ##1 ) and fusion ( s ##2 ) domains . we suggest this loop con ##fers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in lineage ##s a and c , and be a key component in the evolution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission .  
abstract aims a new human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ) , which has been designated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , began spreading in december 2019 in wu ##han city , china causing pneumonia called co ##vid - 19 . the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been faster than any other corona ##virus ##es that have succeeded in crossing the animal - human barrier . there is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two hc ##ov ##s — severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) — each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012 , respectively . thus far , 11 , 268 deaths have been reported from the 258 , 84 ##2 confirmed infections in 168 countries . main methods in this study , the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) of the newly emerged corona ##virus is modeled , valid ##ated , and then targeted using different anti - polymer ##ase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses . key findings the results suggest the effectiveness of rib ##avi ##rin , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir , gal ##ides ##iv ##ir , and ten ##of ##ov ##ir as potent drugs against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 since they tightly bind to its rd ##rp . in addition , the results suggest gu ##ano ##sin ##e derivative ( id ##x - 184 ) , set ##ro ##bu ##vir , and ya ##k as top seeds for anti ##vira ##l treatments with high potential to fight the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain specifically . significance the availability of fda - approved anti - rd ##rp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection co ##vid - 19 . the drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the rd ##rp of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease . no toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the fda .

abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) has become a public health emergency worldwide . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the virus responsible for co ##vid - 19 , is spread by human - to - human transmission via droplets or direct contact . however , since sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( as well as other corona ##virus ##es ) has been found in the fe ##cal samples and anal sw ##ab ##s of some patients , the possibility of fe ##cal - oral ( including water ##borne ) transmission need to be investigated and clarified . this sc ##oping review was conducted to sum ##mar ##ize research data on co ##v in water environments . a literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases pub ##med , em ##base , and web science core collection . this comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records , but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review . in detail , the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas : 1 ) co ##v persistence / survival in waters ; 2 ) co ##v occurrence in water environments ; 3 ) methods for recovery of co ##v from waters . the data available suggest that : i ) co ##v seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to ox ##ida ##nts , like ch ##lor ##ine ; ii ) co ##v appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non - enveloped human enter ##ic viruses with known water ##borne transmission ; iii ) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival ( the ti ##ter of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23 ##° ##c – 25 °c than at 4 °c ) ; iv ) there is no current evidence that human corona ##virus ##es are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking - water ; v ) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enter ##ic , non enveloped viruses from water environments . the evidence - based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain ( i . e . , water and sanitation safety planning ) to protect human health from exposure to corona ##virus through water .  
summary the recent emergence of a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in china has caused significant public health concerns . recently , ace ##2 was reported as an entry receptor for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in this study , we present the crystal structure of the c - terminal domain of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - ct ##d ) spike ( s ) protein in complex with human ace ##2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) , which reveals a ha ##ce ##2 - binding mode similar overall to that observed for sar ##s - co ##v . however , atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitution ##s in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - ct ##d slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than sar ##s - rb ##d . additionally , a panel of mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) and poly ##cl ##onal antibodies ( pa ##bs ) against sar ##s - co ##v - s ##1 / receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) were unable to interact with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein , indicating notable differences in antigen ##ici ##ty between sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . these findings shed light on the viral pathogen ##esis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures against the emerging virus .  
summary we have previously provided the first genetic evidence that ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and ace ##2 protects the lung from injury , providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to sar ##s - co ##v infections . ace ##2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , and it has been proposed that inhibit ##ing this interaction might be used in treating patients with co ##vid - 19 . however , it is not known whether human rec ##om ##bina ##nt soluble ace ##2 ( hr ##sa ##ce ##2 ) blocks growth of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we show that clinical grade hr ##sa ##ce ##2 reduced sar ##s - co ##v - 2 recovery from ve ##ro cells by a factor of 1 , 000 – 5 , 000 . an equivalent mouse rs ##ace ##2 had no effect . we also show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can directly in ##fect engineered human blood vessel organ ##oids and human kidney organ ##oids , which can be inhibit ##ed by hr ##sa ##ce ##2 . these data demonstrate that hr ##sa ##ce ##2 can significantly block early stages of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections .  
summary sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus responsible for the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . although the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome was reported recently , its transcript ##omic architecture is unknown . utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques , we present a high - resolution map of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transcript ##ome and ep ##it ##ran ##script ##ome . dna nano ##ball sequencing shows that the transcript ##ome is highly complex owing to numerous disco ##nti ##nu ##ous transcription events . in addition to the canonical gen ##omic and 9 sub ##gen ##omic rna ##s , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 produces transcript ##s encoding unknown or ##fs with fusion , del ##eti ##on , and / or frames ##hi ##ft . using nano ##pore direct rna sequencing , we further find at least 41 rna modification sites on viral transcript ##s , with the most frequent motif , aa ##ga ##a . modified rna ##s have shorter poly ( a ) tails than un ##mo ##di ##fied rna ##s , suggesting a link between the modification and the 3 ′ tail . functional investigation of the unknown transcript ##s and rna modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
summary the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic , caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , has highlighted the need for anti ##vira ##l approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals . here , we demonstrate a crisp ##r - cas ##13 - based strategy , pac - man ( prop ##hyl ##actic anti ##vira ##l crisp ##r in human cells ) , for viral inhibition that can effectively de ##grade rna from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences and live influenza a virus ( ia ##v ) in human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells . we designed and screened crisp ##r rna ##s ( cr ##rna ##s ) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional cr ##rna ##s targeting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . this approach effectively reduced h ##1 ##n ##1 ia ##v load in respiratory ep ##ith ##elial cells . our bio ##in ##form ##atic analysis showed that a group of only six cr ##rna ##s can target more than 90 % of all corona ##virus ##es . with the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery , pac - man has the potential to become an important pan - corona ##virus inhibition strategy .  
abstract the recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and its associated corona ##virus disease has gripped the entire international community and has caused widespread public health concerns . despite global efforts to contain the disease spread , the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection . this is a zoo ##not ##ic infection , similar to other corona ##virus infections , that is believed to have originated in bats and pang ##olin ##s and later transmitted to humans . once in the human body , this corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is abundant ##ly present in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and saliva ##ry secret ##ions of affected patients , and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory drop ##let / contact in nature . dental professionals , including end ##odon ##tist ##s , may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and will have to act dil ##igen ##tly not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nos ##oco ##mia ##l spread of infection . thus , the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , symptoms , and routes of transmission of this novel infection . in addition , specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient screening , infection control strategies , and patient management protocol .  
summary since its identification in december 2019 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has infected 125 , 04 ##8 persons globally with cases identified in 118 countries across all continents . we report on the scottish index case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , the virus causing co ##vid - 19 .  
summary background severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused an epidemic in china and many other countries . many infected clusters have been found within fa ##mi ##lia ##l households , but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited . methods in this retrospective case series , we enrolled 85 patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and their household members in wu ##han . patients were confirmed infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays on throat sw ##ab ##s . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected . results there were 155 close contacts in total . 104 contacts received rt - pc ##r ass ##ays , with 47 ( 30 % ) positive cases and 57 ( 37 % ) negative cases . 51 ( 33 % ) cases did not received rt - pc ##r tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of qu ##aran ##tine . the infection rate of close contacts was 38 % for households with 1 contact , 50 % for households with 2 contacts , and 31 % for households with 3 contacts . conclusions the rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection was 30 % . our data provide insight into the rate of secondary transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in home .  
abstract background since its discovery , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been spread throughout china before becoming a global pan ##de ##mic . in beijing , family clusters are the main mode of human - human transmission accounting for 57 . 6 % of the total confirmed cases . method we present the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families . result our results revealed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case , and a total of 22 / 24 infections were observed . among those infected , 20 / 22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestation ##s . children in the families generally showed mild ##er symptoms . the inc ##uba ##tion period varied from 2 to 13 days , and the shed ##ding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days . a prolonged period of virus shed ##ding ( > 30 days ) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6 / 24 cases . conclusion sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters . while the infection rate is high within the cluster , the disease manifestation ##s , late ##nt period , and virus shed ##ding period varied greatly . we therefore recommend rigorous ##ly testing contacts even during the no - sy ##mpt ##om phase and consider whether viral shed ##ding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual .  
summary a new virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has spread world - wide since december 2019 , probably affecting millions of people and killing thousands . failure to anti ##ci ##pate the spread of the virus now seriously threatens many health systems . we have designed a model for predicting the evolution of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic in france , which is based on ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce and makes it possible to anti ##ci ##pate the deco ##n ##fine ##ment strategy .  
an es ##cala ##ting pan ##de ##mic by the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus is impact ##ing global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed . we evaluated the in vitro anti ##vira ##l effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit corona ##virus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients . we report the anti ##vira ##l effect of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , lo ##pina ##vir , homo ##rring ##ton ##ine , and em ##eti ##ne against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus in ve ##ro e ##6 cells with the estimated 50 % effective concentration at 23 . 15 μ ##m , 26 . 63 μ ##m , 2 . 55 μ ##m and 0 . 46 μ ##m , respectively . rib ##avi ##rin or fa ##vi ##pi ##ra ##vir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μ ##m . syn ##ergy between re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir and em ##eti ##ne was observed , and re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir at 6 . 25 μ ##m in combination with em ##eti ##ne at 0 . 195 μ ##m may achieve 64 . 9 % inhibition in viral yield . combination ##al therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits .  
abstract although several clinical trials are now underway to test possible the ##ra ##pies , the worldwide response to the co ##vid - 19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring / containment . we report here that iv ##er ##me ##ct ##in , an fda - approved anti - parasitic previously shown to have broad - spectrum anti - viral activity in vitro , is an inhibitor of the ca ##usa ##tive virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , with a single addition to ve ##ro - hs ##lam cells 2 h post infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 able to effect ~ 5000 - fold reduction in viral rna at 48 h . iv ##er ##me ##ct ##in therefore warrant ##s further investigation for possible benefits in humans .  
abstract type 1 inter ##fer ##ons have a broad anti ##vira ##l activity in vitro and are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat mer ##s - co ##v . in this review , we discuss preliminary data concerning the potential activity of type 1 inter ##fer ##ons on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and the relevance of evaluating these molecules in clinical trials for the treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract there is an urgent need to identify anti ##vira ##ls to curt ##ail the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . here ##in , we report the sensitivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to rec ##om ##bina ##nt human inter ##fer ##ons α and β ( if ##n ##α / β ) . treatment with if ##n - α or if ##n - β at a concentration of 50 international units ( i ##u ) per mill ##ili ##ter reduces viral ti ##ters by 3 . 4 log or over 4 log , respectively , in ve ##ro cells . the ec ##50 of if ##n - α and if ##n - β treatment is 1 . 35 i ##u / ml and 0 . 76 i ##u / ml , respectively , in ve ##ro cells . these results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogen ##ic viruses , including sar ##s - co ##v . overall , our results demonstrate the potential efficacy of human type i if ##n in suppress ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , a finding which could inform future treatment options for co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract an outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia caused by a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( β ##co ##v ) , named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization . in order to gain insight into the emergence , evolution and adaptation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses , a comprehensive analysis of genome composition and cod ##on usage of β ##co ##v circulating in china was performed . a biased nu ##cle ##otide composition was found for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome . this bias in gen ##omic composition is reflected in its cod ##on and amino acid usage patterns . the overall cod ##on usage in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased . most of the highly frequent cod ##ons are a - and u - ending , which strongly suggests that mutation ##al bias is the main force shaping cod ##on usage in this virus . significant differences in relative synonymous cod ##on usage frequencies among sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and human cells were found . these differences are due to cod ##on usage preferences .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , sar ##s and mer ##s are all enveloped viruses that can cause acute respiratory syndrome . ara ##chi ##don ##ic acid ( aa ) and other un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acids ( especially e ##ico ##sa ##pen ##ta ##eno ##ic ac ##d , epa and doc ##osa ##he ##xa ##eno ##ic acid dh ##a ) are known to ina ##ct ##ivate enveloped viruses and inhibit proliferation of various micro ##bial organisms . the pro - inflammatory meta ##bol ##ites of aa and epa such as pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##ins , le ##uk ##ot ##rien ##es and th ##rom ##box ##ane ##s induce inflammation whereas lip ##ox ##ins , res ##ol ##vin ##s , protect ##ins and mare ##sin ##s derived from aa , epa and dh ##a not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and aug ##ment ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis of macro ##pha ##ges and other im ##mun ##ocytes and decrease micro ##bial load . in view of these actions , it is suggested that aa and other un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acids and their meta ##bol ##ites may serve as end ##ogen ##ous anti - viral compounds and their deficiency may render humans susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , sar ##s and mer ##s and other similar viruses ’ infections . hence , oral or intra ##ven ##ous administration of aa and other un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acids may aid in enhancing resistance and recovery from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , sar ##s and mer ##s infections .  
abstract the set of measures proposed by sep ##d , ae ##eh , get ##ec ##cu and ae ##g are aimed to help departments in their res ##ump ##tion of usual activity . we have prepared a number of practical recommendations regarding patient management and the step ##wise res ##ump ##tion of healthcare activity . these recommendations are based on the sparse , changing evidence available , and will be updated in the future according to daily needs and the availability of ex ##pen ##dable materials to suit them ; in each department they will be implemented depending upon the cumulative incidence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in each region , and the burden the pan ##de ##mic has represented for each hospital . the general objectives of these recommendations include : to protect our patients against the risks of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and to provide them with high - quality care . to protect all healthcare professionals against the risks of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to resume normal functioning of our departments in a setting of ongoing risk for infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .

abstract since early december 2019 , a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown corona ##virus infection were identified in wu ##han , china , and many additional cases were identified in other regions of china and in other countries within 3 months . currently , more than 80 , 000 cases have been diagnosed in china , including more than 3 , 000 deaths . the epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world , posing a grave challenge to prevention and control . on february 12 , 2020 , the international committee on taxonomy of viruses and the world health organization officially named the novel corona ##virus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , respectively . according to the recent research on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the virus mainly in ##fect ##s the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems . in this paper , we will systematically review the pathogen ##ic features , transmission routes , and infection mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , as well as any adverse effects on the digest ##ive system , ur ##ogen ##ital system , central nervous system , and ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system , in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis , classification , treatment , and pro ##gno ##sis assessment of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) family consists of viruses that in ##fect ##s a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fe ##cal - oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses ' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness . a model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fe ##cal - oral transmission potential ##s of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v using ai and empirical ##ly - based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins . using the percentage ##s of intrinsic disorder ( pi ##d ) of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and membrane ( m ) proteins of co ##v , the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the sar ##s - co ##v ( m pi ##d = 8 % , n pi ##d = 50 % ) falling into category b , in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fe ##cal - oral transmission potential ##s . later , mer ##s - co ##v ( m pi ##d = 9 % , n pi ##d = 44 % ) was found to be in category c , which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fe ##cal - oral transmission capabilities . based on the peculiar ##ities of disorder distribution , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( m pi ##d = 6 % , n pi ##d = 48 % ) has to be placed in category b . our data show however , that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell , ( m pi ##d = 6 % ) among corona ##virus ##es . this means that it might be expected to be highly res ##ili ##ent in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body . an infected body is like ##lier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to anti ##mic ##ro ##bial enzymes in body fluids . these particles are also like ##lier to remain active longer . these factors could account for the greater con ##tag ##ious ##ness of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread .  
abstract the emerging global infectious co ##vid - 19 disease by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late december 2019 in china . the virus has gone through various pathways of evolution . to understand the evolution and transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of virus isolate ##s is of great importance . this study presents an accurate method for effectively gen ##ot ##yp ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses using complete genome ##s . the method employs the multiple sequence alignment ##s of the genome isolate ##s with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reference genome . the single - nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ( s ##np ) gen ##otype ##s are then measured by ja ##cca ##rd distances to track the relationship of virus isolate ##s . the gen ##ot ##yp ##ing analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the pre ##dom ##inated mutation type during the current epidemic . the proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogen ##ic viruses in their global and local genetic variations . the gen ##ot ##yp ##ing analysis shows that the genes encoding the s proteins and rna polymer ##ase , rna prima ##se , and nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein , undergo frequent mutations . these mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control .  
abstract viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions , and even to cause severe neurological damage . very recently , corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) , especially severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , exhibit ne ##uro ##tro ##pic properties and may also cause neurological diseases . it is reported that co ##v can be found in the brain or ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid . the path ##ob ##iology of these ne ##uro ##in ##vas ##ive viruses is still incomplete ##ly known , and it is therefore important to explore the impact of co ##v infections on the nervous system . here , we review the research into neurological complications in co ##v infections and the possible mechanisms of damage to the nervous system .  
abstract little or nothing is known about the correlation between the upper limbs deep vein th ##rom ##bos ##is ( ul - d ##v ##t ) and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we describe the increased risk of ul - d ##v ##t in 3 patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 who require continuous positive air ##way pressure with hood and the need for early adequate anti ##th ##rom ##bot ##ic prop ##hyl ##ax ##is .  
abstract it has been reported that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may use ace ##2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells , in a way similar to that of sar ##s - co ##v . analyzing the distribution and expression level of ace ##2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and post - infection modulation . in this study , we utilized previously uploaded information on ace ##2 expression in various conditions including sar ##s - coa to evaluate the role of ace ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v and extra ##pol ##ate that to co ##vid - 19 . we found that the expression of ace ##2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different . however , based on the elevated expression of ace ##2 in cigarette smoke ##rs , we spec ##ulate that long - term smoking may be a risk factor for co ##vid - 19 . analysis of ace ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells suggests that ace ##2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post - infection regulation , including immune response , cy ##tok ##ine secret ##ion , and viral genome replication . moreover , we constructed protein - protein interaction ( pp ##i ) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cy ##tok ##ine secret ##ion . our findings may help clinic ##ians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and design therapeutic strategies for co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract in december 2019 , a novel corona ##virus , named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , emerged from china causing pneumonia outbreak ##s , first in the wu ##han region of china and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency . owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic , drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution . ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , lo ##pina ##vir , rib ##avi ##rin and ri ##ton ##avi ##r have shown efficacy to inhibit corona ##virus in vitro . te ##ico ##pl ##ani ##n , an anti ##biotic used to treat st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##cca ##l infections , previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) viral life cycle in human cells . this activity is conserved against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , thus placing te ##ico ##pl ##ani ##n as a potential treatment for patients with this virus .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the novel corona ##virus from china , is spreading around the world , causing a huge reaction despite its current low incidence outside china and the far east . four common corona ##virus ##es are in current circulation and cause millions of cases worldwide . this article compares the incidence and mortality rates of these four common corona ##virus ##es with those of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in organisation for economic co - operation and development countries . it is concluded that the problem of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is probably being over ##est ##imated , as 2 . 6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at the time of writing .  
abstract the pneumonia caused by novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in wu ##han , china in december 2019 is a highly con ##tag ##ious disease . the world health organization ( who ) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency . currently , the research on novel corona ##virus is still in the primary stage . based on the current published evidence , we systematically sum ##mar ##izes the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical characteristics , diagnosis , treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding co ##vid - 19 . this review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , and providing a reference for future studies .  
abstract viral respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) always pose a severe threat to people . first identified in late december 2019 , a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ; sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has affected many provinces in china and multiple countries worldwide . the viral outbreak has aroused panic and a public - health emergency around the world , and the number of infections continues to rise . however , the causes and consequences of the pneumonia remain unknown . to effectively implement epidemic prevention , early identification and diagnosis are critical to disease control . here we sc ##rut ##ini ##se a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestation ##s , detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , named corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection .  
abstract the recent emergence of the novel pathogen ##ic sar ##s - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is responsible for a worldwide pan ##de ##mic . given the global health emergency , drug rep ##osition ##ing is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay . the first step of the viral replication cycle [ i . e . attachment to the surface of respiratory cells , mediated by the spike ( s ) viral protein ] offers several potential therapeutic targets . the s protein uses the ang ##iot ##ens ##ion - converting enzyme - 2 ( ace - 2 ) receptor for entry , but also si ##alic acids linked to host cell surface gang ##lio ##side ##s . using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches , this study showed that ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( cl ##q ) , one of the drugs currently under investigation for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 treatment , binds si ##alic acids and gang ##lio ##side ##s with high affinity . a new type of gang ##lio ##side - binding domain at the tip of the n - terminal domain of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein was identified . this domain ( 111 – 158 ) , which is fully conserved among clinical isolate ##s worldwide , may improve attachment of the virus to lip ##id raft ##s and facilitate contact with the ace - 2 receptor . this study showed that , in the presence of cl ##q [ or its more active derivative , hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( cl ##q - oh ) ] , the viral s protein is no longer able to bind gang ##lio ##side ##s . the identification of this new mechanism of action of cl ##q and cl ##q - oh supports the use of these rep ##osition ##ed drugs to cure patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the in - si ##lic ##o approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of rep ##osition ##ed and / or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation .  
abstract the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic is an urgent global public health emergency and warrant ##s investigating studies on bon ##af ##ide anti ##vira ##ls for combat . here we report the drug target and mechanism of action of potential anti ##vira ##l drug ar ##bid ##ol for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections . our structural and molecular dynamics studies show how ar ##bid ##ol targets the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and imp ##ede the trim ##eri ##zation of spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , which is a key for host cell ad ##hesion and hi ##jack ##ing , thus placing ar ##bid ##ol as a potential drug for rep ##ur ##po ##sing . this study also abe ##ts in the development of other new therapeutic ##s for co ##iv ##d - 19 disease based on ar ##bid ##ol binding mode and using structure - guided drug designing .  
abstract ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme - 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptors media ##te the entry into the cell of three strains of corona ##virus : sar ##s - co ##v , nl ##6 ##3 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . ace ##2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart , vessels , gut , lung ( particularly in type 2 p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and macro ##pha ##ges ) , kidney , test ##is and brain . ace ##2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form . an important sal ##uta ##ry function of membrane - bound and soluble ace ##2 is the degradation of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii to ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##1 - 7 . consequently , ace ##2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii to at ##1 receptors , which include va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tion , enhanced inflammation and th ##rom ##bos ##is . the increased generation of ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##1 - 7 also triggers counter - regulatory protective effects through binding to g - protein coupled mas receptors . unfortunately , the entry of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down - regulates ace ##2 receptors , with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane . increased pulmonary inflammation and coa ##gul ##ation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii effects via the ace ##→ ##ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii ##→ ##at ##1 receptor axis . clinical reports of patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease ( i . e . , older age , hyper ##tension , diabetes , cardiovascular disease ) share a variable degree of ace ##2 deficiency . we suggest that ace ##2 down - regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ace ##2 deficiency associated with the above conditions . the additional ace ##2 deficiency after viral invasion might amp ##li ##fy the d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation between the ‘ adverse ’ ace ##→ ##ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii ##→ ##at ##1 receptor axis and the ‘ protective ’ ace ##2 ##→ ##ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##1 - 7 ##→ ##mas receptor axis . in the lungs , such d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation would favor the progression of inflammatory and th ##rom ##bot ##ic processes triggered by local ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii hyper ##act ##ivity unopposed by ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##1 - 7 . in this setting , rec ##om ##bina ##nt ace ##2 , ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##1 - 7 and ang ##iot ##ens ##in ii type 1 receptor block ##ers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
summary an outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) began in the city of wu ##han in china and has widely spread worldwide . currently , it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to control co ##vid - 19 spread . therefore , we rein ##ves ##ti ##gated published data from pang ##olin lung samples from which sar ##s - co ##v - like co ##vs were detected by liu et al . [ 1 ] . we found gen ##omic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - like co ##v ( named pang ##olin - co ##v ) in dead malaya ##n pang ##olin ##s . pang ##olin - co ##v is 91 . 02 % and 90 . 55 % identical to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and bat ##co ##v rat ##g ##13 , respectively , at the whole - genome level . aside from rat ##g ##13 , pang ##olin - co ##v is the most closely related co ##v to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the s ##1 protein of pang ##olin - co ##v is much more closely related to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 than to rat ##g ##13 . five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ace ##2 are completely consistent between pang ##olin - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , but four amino acid mutations are present in rat ##g ##13 . both pang ##olin - co ##v and rat ##g ##13 lost the put ##ative fur ##in recognition sequence motif at s ##1 / s ##2 cleavage site that can be observed in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . con ##clusive ##ly , this study suggests that pang ##olin species are a natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - like co ##vs .  
the pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has posed a severe threat to global public health . yet , the origin of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 remains mysterious . several recent studies ( e . g . , lam et al . , xiao et al . ) identified sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - related viruses in pang ##olin ##s , providing novel insights into the evolution and diversity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - related viruses .  
abstract purpose lia ##nh ##ua ##qing ##wen ( l ##h ) as traditional chinese medicine ( tc ##m ) formula has been used to treat influenza and ex ##erted broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l effects on a series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects ding et al . ( 2017 ) . the goal of this study is to demonstrate the anti ##vira ##l activity of l ##h against the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response . methods the anti ##vira ##l activity of l ##h against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was assessed in ve ##ro e ##6 cells using cp ##e and plaque reduction ass ##ay . the effect of l ##h on vi ##rion morphology was visual ##ized under transmission electron microscope . pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine expression levels upon sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in huh - 7 cells were measured by real - time quantitative pc ##r ass ##ays . results l ##h significantly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication in ve ##ro e ##6 cells and markedly reduced pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines ( tn ##f - α , il - 6 , cc ##l - 2 / mc ##p - 1 and c ##x ##cl - 10 / ip - 10 ) production at the mrna levels . furthermore , l ##h treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of vi ##rion in cells . conclusions l ##h significantly inhibit ##s the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication , affects virus morphology and ex ##ert ##s anti - inflammatory activity in vitro . these findings indicate that l ##h protects against the virus attack , making its use a novel strategy for controlling the co ##vid - 19 disease .  
abstract outbreak and pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in 2019 / 2020 will challenge global health for the future . because a vaccine against the virus will not be available in the near future , we here ##in try to offer a ph ##arm ##aco ##logical strategy to combat the virus . there exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit infection with and replication of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . such drugs comprise inhibitors of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se and inhibitors of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . blockade of ace ##2 , the host cell receptor for the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and inhibition of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , which is required for s protein pri ##ming may prevent cell entry of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . further , ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e and hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , and off - label anti ##vira ##l drugs , such as the nu ##cle ##otide analogue re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , hiv pro ##tea ##se inhibitors lo ##pina ##vir and ri ##ton ##avi ##r , broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs ar ##bid ##ol and fa ##vi ##pi ##ra ##vir as well as anti ##vira ##l ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als available to date may prevent spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and mor ##bid ##ity and mortality of co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic .  
abstract the pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) has emerged as a major health crisis , with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) having infected over a million people around the world within a few months of its identification as a human pathogen . initially , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect ##s cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death . subsequently , the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues , triggering a complicated spectrum of path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logical changes and symptoms , including cardiovascular complications . acting as the receptor for sar ##s - co ##v entering mammalian cells , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme - 2 ( ace ##2 ) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function . diverse clinical manifestation ##s and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in co ##vid - 19 , character ##izing the development of this com ##plication , as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment . this review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy and therapeutic approaches to co ##vid - 19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the causal agent of co ##vid - 19 , first emerged in late 2019 in china . it has since infected more than 870 , 000 individuals and caused more than 43 , 000 deaths globally . here , we discuss therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic interventions for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges . vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pan ##de ##mic . nevertheless , critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses . importantly , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccines will be essential to reducing mor ##bid ##ity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population .  
abstract background the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is a new human corona ##virus which is spreading with epidemic features in china and other asian countries ; cases have also been reported worldwide . this novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) . although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , co ##vid - 19 shows some peculiar pathogen ##etic , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood . aims to provide a review of the differences in pathogen ##esis , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical features of co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s and mer ##s . sources the most recent literature in the english language regarding co ##vid - 19 has been reviewed , and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about sar ##s and mer ##s epidemic ##s . content co ##vid - 19 seems not to be very different from sar ##s regarding its clinical features . however , it has a fatal ##ity rate of 2 . 3 % , lower than that of sar ##s ( 9 . 5 % ) and much lower than that of mer ##s ( 34 . 4 % ) . the possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of co ##vid - 19 it can spread in the community more easily than mer ##s and sar ##s . the actual basic reproductive number ( r ##0 ) of co ##vid - 19 ( 2 . 0 – 2 . 5 ) is still controversial . it is probably slightly higher than the r ##0 of sar ##s ( 1 . 7 – 1 . 9 ) and higher than that of mer ##s ( < 1 ) . a gas ##tro ##int ##estinal route of transmission for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which has been assumed for sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation . implications there is still much more to know about co ##vid - 19 , especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pan ##de ##mic level . nonetheless , all of the lessons we learned in the past from the sar ##s and mer ##s epidemic ##s are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat .  
abstract objective to evaluate a reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) ass ##ay for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and compare it with rt polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) . methods we designed prime ##rs specific to the or ##f ##1 ##ab and s genes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . total viral rna was extracted using the qi ##aa ##mp viral rna mini kit . we opt ##imi ##zed the rt - lamp ass ##ay . and , this ass ##ay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specific ##ity of detection using real - time tu ##rb ##idi ##ty monitoring and visual observation . results the prime ##r sets or ##f ##1 ##ab - 4 and s - 123 amplified the genes in the shortest times , the mean ( ± ##sd ) time was 18 ± 1 . 32 min and 20 ± 1 . 80 min , respectively , and 63 ##° ##c was the opt ##imum reaction temperature . the sensitivity was 2 ##× ##10 ##1 copies and 2 ##× ##10 ##2 copies per reaction with prime ##r sets or ##f ##1 ##ab - 4 and s - 123 , respectively . this ass ##ay showed no cross - react ##ivity with other 60 respiratory pathogen ##s . to describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis , we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinical ##ly suspected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . among them , 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by rt - lamp . the sen ##sit ##ici ##ty was 100 % ( 95 % ci 92 . 3 % - 100 % ) , specific ##ity 100 % ( 95 % ci 93 . 7 % - 100 % ) . this ass ##ay detected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the mean ( ± ##sd ) time of 26 . 28 ± 4 . 48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation . conclusion these results demonstrate that we developed a rapid , simple , specific , and sensitive rt - lamp ass ##ay for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection among clinical samples . it will be a powerful tool for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 identification , and for monitoring suspected patients , close contacts , and high - risk groups .  
abstract background the rapid spread of the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by a zoo ##not ##ic beta - corona ##virus entitled 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , has become a global threat . awareness of the biological features of 2019 - nc ##ov should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensive ##ly summarized to help opt ##imi ##ze control measures and make therapeutic decisions . methods based on recently published literature ##s , official documents and selected up - to - date prep ##rin ##t studies , we reviewed the vi ##rol ##ogy and origin , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical manifestation ##s , pathology and treatment of 2019 - nc ##ov infection , in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection . results the genome of 2019 - nc ##ov partially resembled sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , and indicating a bat origin . the co ##vid - 19 generally had a high reproductive number , a long inc ##uba ##tion period , a short serial interval and a low case fatal ##ity rate ( much higher in patients with como ##rb ##idi ##ties ) than sar ##s and mer ##s . clinical presentation and pathology of co ##vid - 19 greatly resembled sar ##s and mer ##s , with less upper respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms , and more ex ##uda ##tive lesions in post - mort ##em ##s . potential treatments included re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , to ##ci ##li ##zu ##ma ##b , con ##vale ##scent plasma and vaccine im ##mun ##ization ( when possible ) . conclusion the initial experience from the current pan ##de ##mic and lessons from the previous two pan ##de ##mics can help improve future prepared ##ness plans and combat disease progression .  
abstract objectives the aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 among hospital environment surfaces , sewage , and personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) of staff ##s in isolation wards in the first affiliated hospital of zhejiang university , china . methods surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 ##mg / l ch ##lor ##ine containing di ##sin ##fect ##ant . air and sewage di ##sin ##fect ##ion was proceeded routinely and strictly . hospital environmental surfaces and pp ##e of staff ##s in isolation wards were sampled using sw ##ab ##s . the sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled . the respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected . the respiratory specimens of staff ##s in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week . quantitative real - time reverse transcription pc ##r ( q ##rt - pc ##r ) methods were used to confirm the existence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . viral culture was done for the samples positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . results during the study period , 33 laboratory - confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital . none of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staff ##s pp ##e samples in isolation wards . though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of prep ##ro ##ces ##sing di ##sin ##fect ##ion pool were positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna and the sample from the outlet of prep ##ro ##ces ##sing di ##sin ##fect ##ion pool was weakly positive , the sewage sample from the outlet of the last di ##sin ##fect ##ion pool was negative . all of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . none of the respiratory specimens of staff ##s in the isolation wards were positive . conclusions though sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna of the sewage samples were positive from inlet ##s of the sewage di ##sin ##fect ##ion pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage di ##sin ##fect ##ion pool , no viable virus was detected by culture . the monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict di ##sin ##fect ##ion and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital - associated co ##vid - 19 infection risk of the staff ##s in isolation wards .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the newly identified human corona ##virus causing severe pneumonia pan ##de ##mic , was probably originated from chinese horseshoe bats . however , direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact , implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts . ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , but only ace ##2 ##s of certain species can be utilized by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we evaluated and ranked the receptor - utilizing capability of ace ##2 ##s from various species by phylogenetic cluster ##ing and sequence alignment with the currently known ace ##2 ##s utilized by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . as a result , we predicted that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 tends to utilize ace ##2 ##s of various mammals , except mu ##rine ##s , and some birds , such as pigeon . this prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract several research lines are currently ongoing to address the multitude of face ##ts of the pan ##de ##mic co ##vid - 19 . in line with the one - health concept , extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 biology and pathogen ##etic mechanisms ; thus , helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures . the last two decades have already faced severe manifestation ##s of the corona ##virus infection in both humans and animals , thus , circulating ep ##ito ##pes from previous outbreak ##s might con ##fer partial protection from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections . in the present study , we provide an in - si ##lic ##o survey of the major nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ep ##ito ##pes and compare them with the homo ##logue ##s of taxonomic ##ally - related corona ##virus ##es with tr ##op ##ism for animal species that are closely inter - related with the human beings population all over the world . protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homo ##logy for some of the investigated proteins . moreover , structural ep ##ito ##pe mapping by homo ##logy modelling revealed a potential im ##mun ##ogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins . these evidence provide a molecular structural rational ##e for a potential role in con ##fer ##ring protection from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prop ##hyl ##actic - oriented strategies .  
abstract in late december 2019 , the world woke to a reality of a pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , eli ##cite ##d by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which belongs to a group of β - corona ##virus . the potential to cause life - threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts co ##vid - 19 in the list of public health emergency of international concern ( ph ##ei ##c ) . in the last two decades , this is the 3rd dead ##liest corona ##virus pan ##de ##mic , following sar ##s which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) from 2012 till date . globally and as of april 1st 2020 , co ##vid - 19 has affected 92 ##4 , 68 ##8 individuals in over 200 countries , causing 46 , 36 ##8 fatalities . while the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 originated in china with over 82 , 72 ##4 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review , the rapid transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of china to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland china . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is suspected to be zoo ##not ##ic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats . extreme pre ##ca ##ution ##ary measures , such as cu ##rf ##ew , shutting of borders and qu ##aran ##tin ##ing of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect ; however , due to individuals that are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , un ##con ##tro ##lled human - to - human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lock ##down measures . this review article sum ##mar ##izes the developing situation surrounding the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic with respect to its ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , unique gen ##omic structure , possible origins , transmission , pathogen ##esis , comparison with other deadly species of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature .  
in the past decade we have seen two major e ##bola virus outbreak ##s in africa , the z ##ika virus in brazil and the americas and the current pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . there is a strong sense of de ##ja vu because there are still no effective treatments . in the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , despite being a new virus , there are already drugs suggested as active in in vitro ass ##ays that are being rep ##ur ##posed in clinical trials . promising sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral targets and computational approaches are described and discussed . here , we propose , based on open anti ##vira ##l drug discovery approaches for previous outbreak ##s , that there could still be gaps in our approach to drug discovery .  
abstract background a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , emerged in china in late 2019 and subsequently caused a pan ##de ##mic . surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pan ##de ##mic and to longitudinal ##ly monitor the effectiveness of public health measures . objectives we aimed to provide a rapid , easy to establish and cost ##ef ##fect ##ive laboratory - based surveillance tool for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . study design : we used mini ##pool ##s of rna prepared from nuclei ##c acid extraction ##s of routine respiratory samples . we technically valid ##ated the ass ##ay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five german university laboratories . results we tested a total of 70 mini ##pool ##s resembling 700 samples shortly before the ups ##urg ##e of cases in germany from 17 . 02 . 2020 - 10 . 03 . 2020 . one mini ##pool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested sar ##s - co ##v - 2 positive . this sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . conclusions our approach of a laboratory - based surveillance for sar ##sco ##v - 2 using mini ##pool ##s proved its concept is easily adapt ##able and resource - saving . it might assist not only public health laboratories in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 surveillance .  
abstract pneumonia is an important cause of mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in children . we described viral ae ##ti ##ologies , with particular interest in detecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in hospitalized pneumonia children . human rhino ##virus was the most frequently detected agent . no children tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . our findings suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is rare in children and it was not circulating in rome before co ##vid - 19 outbreak .  
abstract in response to the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , commercial molecular ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing have been rapidly developed and broadly deployed in laboratories worldwide . although these ass ##ays have been reported to co ##rre ##late well , we sought to compare the xp ##ert ##® xp ##ress sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to the co ##bas ##® sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or the light ##mi ##x ##® modular sar ##s and wu ##han co ##v e - gene ass ##ay for nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al ( np ) sw ##ab ##s with low levels of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . thirty - seven np sw ##ab ##s were studied , including 10 samples with a moderate cycle threshold ( ct ) between 30 - 33 . 9 , and 22 with ct ##≥ ##34 , and 5 negative for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . overall concord ##ance on initial comparison was 86 . 5 % ( 32 / 37 ) , which was 100 % concord ##ance for samples with ct values ranging between 30 - 33 . 9 . disco ##rdan ##ce amongst samples showing a ct ≥ ##34 was 22 . 7 % ( 5 / 22 ) . end ##point value analysis on the xp ##ress sar ##s - co ##v - 2 within the disco ##rdan ##t samples noted two with an end ##point value > 5 , which were detected by the co ##bas ##® or light ##mi ##x ##® . testing of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 on the three commercial ass ##ays was comparable for np sw ##ab ##s with moderate ct values , while high ct values were less concord ##ant . importantly , analysis of xp ##ert ##® end ##point values improved interpretation of disc ##re ##pan ##t results .  
abstract background the ongoing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic presents a unique challenge for diagnostic laboratories around the world . automation of work ##flow ##s in molecular diagnostic ##s is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinic ##ians , as well as providing fast - tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases . in this study we evaluated a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ld ##t for the ne ##um ##od ##x 96 system , a fully automated device performing extraction and real - time pc ##r . methods a publicly available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r ass ##ay was adapted for the automated system . analytical performance was evaluated using in - vitro transcribed rna and clinical performance was compared to the co ##bas 680 ##0 - based reference ass ##ay within the lab . results the envelope ( e ) gene - ld ##t displayed good analytical performance with an lo ##d of 95 . 55 cp / ml and no false positive ##s during evaluation of cross - react ##ivity . a total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the e - gene - ld ##t and the reference ass ##ay . positive and negative agreement were 100 % and 99 . 2 % respectively . invalid - rate was 6 . 3 % . conclusion the e - gene - ld ##t showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the co ##bas ##6 ##80 ##0 - based reference ass ##ay . due to its random - access work ##flow concept and rapid time - to - result of about 80 minutes , the system is very well suited for providing fast - tracked sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnostic ##s for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting .  
abstract background facing the ongoing pan ##de ##mic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , there is an urgent need for ser ##ological ass ##ays identifying individuals with past corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . study design our study is the first to compare four new commercially available ass ##ays using 75 sera from patients tested positive or negative by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pc ##r : the anti sar ##s - co ##v - 2 elisa ( i ##gg ) ( euro ##im ##mun , germany ) , the ed ##i new corona ##virus co ##vid - 19 i ##gg elisa , ( ep ##ito ##pe diagnostic ##s ( ed ##i ) , usa ) , the rec ##om ##well sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gg elisa ( mi ##kr ##ogen , germany ) , and the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vi ##rac ##hip i ##gg ( vi ##ram ##ed , germany ) . results we found a sensitivity of 86 . 4 % , 100 % , 86 . 4 % , and 77 . 3 % and a specific ##ity of 96 , 2 % , 88 , 7 % , 100 % , and 100 % for the euro ##im ##mun ass ##ay , the ed ##i ass ##ay , the mi ##kr ##ogen ass ##ay , and the vi ##ram ##ed ass ##ay , respectively . conclusions commercially available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gg ass ##ays have a sufficient specific ##ity and sensitivity for identifying individuals with past sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
corona ##virus ( co ##v ) disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v - 2 ( also known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) is threatening global public health , social stability , and economic development . to meet this challenge , this article discusses advances in the research and development of neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) for the prevention and treatment of infection by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other human co ##vs .  
abstract since the start of the latest corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) outbreak , the number of infected individuals and cases of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) has been increasing exponential ##ly worldwide . of interest is existing evidence that or ##chi ##tis can develop due corona ##virus infection . it is therefore not unreasonable to believe that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could be transmitted by se ##men . consequently , it is of paramount importance that individuals who could potentially be infected take all possible care to mit ##igate the likely risk of passing on the infection through sexual intercourse .  
summary background cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection continue to rise in the arabian peninsula 7 years after it was first described in saudi arabia . mer ##s - co ##v poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective counter ##me ##as ##ures . we aimed to assess the safety and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of the candidate simi ##an aden ##ov ##irus - vector ##ed vaccine expressing the full - length spike surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , in humans . methods this dose - es ##cala ##tion , open - label , non - random ##ised , un ##con ##tro ##lled , phase 1 trial was done at the centre for clinical va ##cci ##nology and tropical medicine ( oxford , uk ) and included healthy people aged 18 – 50 years with negative pre - va ##cci ##nation tests for hiv antibodies , hepatitis b surface antigen , and hepatitis c antibodies ( and a negative ur ##ina ##ry pregnancy test for women ) . participants received a single intra ##mus ##cular injection of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s at three different doses : the low - dose group received 5 × 109 viral particles , the intermediate - dose group received 2 · 5 × 101 ##0 viral particles , and the high - dose group received 5 × 101 ##0 viral particles . the primary objective was to assess safety and to ##ler ##ability of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , measured by the occurrence of sol ##ici ##ted , un ##sol ##ici ##ted , and serious adverse events after va ##cci ##nation . the secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humor ##al im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , measured by inter ##fer ##on - γ - linked enzyme - linked im ##mun ##os ##pot , elisa , and virus neutral ##ising ass ##ays after va ##cci ##nation . participants were followed up for up to 12 months . this study is registered with clinical ##tri ##als . gov , nc ##t ##0 ##33 ##9 ##9 ##57 ##8 . findings between march 14 and aug 15 , 2018 , 24 participants were enrolled : six were assigned to the low - dose group , nine to the intermediate - dose group , and nine to the high - dose group . all participants were available for follow - up at 6 months , but five ( one in the low - dose group , one in the intermediate - dose group , and three in the high - dose group ) were lost to follow - up at 12 months . a single dose of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s was safe at doses up to 5 × 101 ##0 viral particles with no vaccine - related serious adverse events reported by 12 months . one serious adverse event reported was deemed to be
summary background the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes a respiratory disease with a case fatal ##ity rate of up to 35 % . given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious drugs or vaccines , mer ##s is one of the who priority diseases warrant ##ing urgent research and development of counter ##me ##as ##ures . we aimed to assess safety and to ##ler ##ability of an anti - mer ##s - co ##v modified va ##cci ##nia virus ankara ( mv ##a ) - based vaccine candidate that expresses the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , mv ##a - mer ##s - s , in healthy adults . methods this open - label , phase 1 trial was done at the university medical center hamburg - ep ##pen ##dorf ( hamburg , germany ) . participants were healthy men and women aged 18 – 55 years with no clinical ##ly significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination , a body - mass index of 18 · 5 – 30 · 0 kg / m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening , and a negative pregnancy test for women . a key exclusion criterion was a previous mv ##a va ##cci ##nation . for the prime im ##mun ##isation , participants received doses of 1 × 107 plaque - forming unit ( p ##fu ; low - dose group ) or 1 × 108 p ##fu ( high - dose group ) mv ##a - mer ##s - s intra ##mus ##cular ##ly . a second identical dose was administered intra ##mus ##cular ##ly as a booster im ##mun ##isation 28 days after first injection . as a control group for im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity analyses , blood samples were drawn at identical study time ##points from six healthy adults , who did not receive any injection ##s . the primary objectives of the study were safety and to ##ler ##ability of the two dos ##age levels and react ##ogenic ##ity after administration . im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity was assessed as a secondary end ##point by elisa and neutral ##isation tests . t - cell immunity was evaluated by inter ##fer ##on - γ - linked enzyme - linked immune absorb ##ent spot ass ##ay . all participants who were va ##cci ##nated at least once were included in the safety analysis . im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity was anal ##yse ##d in the participants who completed 6 months of follow - up . this trial is registered with clinical ##tri ##als . gov , nc ##t ##0 ##36 ##15 ##9 ##11 , and eu ##dra ##ct , 2014 - 00 ##31 ##9 ##5 - 23 findings from dec 17 , 2017 , to june 5 , 2018 , 26 participants ( 14 in the low - dose group and 12 in the high - dose group ) were enrolled and
abstract infection caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death . patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course . in this report we suggest that patients with systemic lu ##pus er ##ythe ##mat ##ous might be especially prone to severe co ##vid - 19 independent of their im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed state from lu ##pus treatment . specifically , we provide evidence in lu ##pus to suggest h ##yp ##ome ##thy ##lation and over ##ex ##press ##ion of ace ##2 , which is located on the x chromosome and en ##codes a functional receptor for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . ox ##ida ##tive stress induced by viral infections ex ##ace ##rba ##tes the dna methyl ##ation defect in lu ##pus , possibly resulting in further ace ##2 h ##yp ##ome ##thy ##lation and enhanced vi ##rem ##ia . in addition , dem ##eth ##yla ##tion of inter ##fer ##on - regulated genes , n ##f ##κ ##b , and key cy ##tok ##ine genes in lu ##pus patients might ex ##ace ##rba ##te the immune response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and increase the likelihood of cy ##tok ##ine storm . these arguments suggest that inherent ep ##igen ##etic d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation in lu ##pus might facilitate viral entry , vi ##rem ##ia , and an excessive immune response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . further , maintaining disease re ##mission in lu ##pus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of dem ##eth ##yla ##tion and increased ox ##ida ##tive stress , which will ex ##ace ##rba ##te su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection during the current pan ##de ##mic . ep ##igen ##etic control of the ace ##2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract background and aims the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic is a worldwide emergency . an increasing number of dia ##rr ##hea cases is reported . here we investigate the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical presentation , molecular mechanisms , management , and prevention of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 associated dia ##rr ##hea . methods we searched on pub ##med , em ##base , and web of science up to march 2020 to identify studies documenting dia ##rr ##hea and me ##chan ##sis ##m of int ##estinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . results clinical studies show an incidence rate of dia ##rr ##hea ranging from 2 % to 50 % of cases . it may pre ##cede or trail respiratory symptoms . a poole ##d analysis revealed an overall percentage of dia ##rr ##hea onset of 10 . 4 % . sar ##s - co ##v uses the the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) and the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 for s protein pri ##ming . ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 are not only expressed in lung , but also in the small int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elia . ace ##2 is expressed furthermore in the upper es ##op ##ha ##gus , liver , and colon . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binding affinity to ace ##2 is significantly higher ( 10 - 20 times ) compared with sar ##s - co ##v . several reports indicate viral rna shed ##ding in stool detect ##able longer time period than in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . current treatment is supportive , but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation . conclusion dia ##rr ##hea is a frequent presenting sy ##mpt ##om in patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . increasing evidence indicates possible fe ##cal oral transmission , indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms . the optimal methods to prevent , manage , and treat dia ##rr ##hea in co ##vid - 19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research .  
abstract co ##vid - 2019 emerged from china in late december . it follows two other corona ##virus outbreak ##s , the sar ##s - co ##v and the mer ##s - co ##v . corona ##virus ##es usually ci ##rc ##ulate among animals but sometimes can jump to humans . these three strains have caused severe disease in humans and global transmission concerns . symptoms of co ##vid - 2019 include cough , fever , and short ##ness of breath . related illnesses can range from mild to severe to fatal . primary care providers must be alert to respiratory symptoms they encounter that are associated with per ##tine ##nt travel history , be prepared to safely screen , examine and possibly test and / or report suspicions to the health department for further evaluation .  
abstract the new corona ##virus outbreak is an ongoing pan ##de ##mic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the new corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 belongs to the subfamily of β ##− ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es and shares 79 . 5 % of the genetic sequence of sar ##s - co ##v , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004 . considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak , it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection as well as the role of virus - specific t cells and by b - l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes . moreover , specific data on the production of i ##gg and i ##gm is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection . in this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . indeed , this test represents an important im ##mun ##ological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate ph ##arm ##aco ##logical treatment . lastly , we provided an overview of ph ##arm ##aco ##logical treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract information is lacking on the clinical impact of the novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 on people with cy ##stic fi ##bro ##sis ( cf ) . our aim was to character ##ize sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in people with cy ##stic fi ##bro ##sis . methods : an ##ony ##mise ##d data submitted by each participating country to their national cf registry was reported using a standard ##ised template , then col ##lated and sum ##mar ##ised . results : 40 cases have been reported across 8 countries . of the 40 cases , 31 ( 78 % ) were sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at presentation , with 24 ( 60 % ) having a fever . 70 % have recovered , 30 % remain un ##res ##olved at time of reporting , and no deaths have been submitted . conclusions : this early report shows good recovery from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in this het ##ero ##gen ##eous cf co ##hort . the disease course does not seem to differ from the general population , but the current numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions and people with cf should continue to strictly follow public health advice to protect themselves from infection .  
abstract in the present study we analyze the ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic data of co ##vid - 19 of tibet and high - altitude regions of bolivia and ecuador , and compare to lowland data , to test the hypothesis that high - altitude inhabitants ( + 2500 m above sea - level ) are less susceptible to develop severe adverse effect in acute sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus infection . analysis of available ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data suggest that physiological adaptations that counter ##balance the h ##yp ##ox ##ic environment altitude may protect from severe impact of acute sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus infection . potential underlying mechanisms such as : ( i ) a compromised half - live of the virus caused by the high - altitude environment , and ( ii ) a h ##yp ##ox ##ia mediated down regulation of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which is the main binding target of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus in the pulmonary ep ##ith ##elia are discussed .  
abstract objective to determine the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) rna in respiratory and fe ##cal specimens in children with corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . methods from january 17 , 2020 to february 23 , 2020 , three pa ##ed ##ia ##tric cases of co ##vid - 19 were reported in qing ##da ##o , shandong province , china . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , clinical , laboratory , and radio ##logical characteristics and treatment data were collected . patients were followed up to march 10 , 2020 , and dynamic profiles of nuclei ##c acid testing results in throat sw ##ab ##s and fe ##cal specimens were closely monitored . results clearance of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after aba ##tem ##ent of fever , whereas viral rna remained detect ##able in stool ##s of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks . two children had fe ##cal sar ##s - co ##v - 2 und ##ete ##ctable 20 days after throat sw ##ab ##s showing negative , while that of another child la ##gged behind for 8 days . conclusions sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may exist in children ' s gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system . persistent shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in stool ##s of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated f ##omi ##tes . massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after re ##open ##ing of kindergarten ##s and schools .  
abstract back ##rou ##nd and aims according to the world obesity federation , “ obesity - related conditions seem to worse ##n the effect of co ##vid - 19 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) ” ; additionally the centres for disease control and prevention reported that “ people with heart disease and diabetes are at higher risk of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 complications and that severe obesity poses a higher risk for severe illness ” . recent reports have shown elevated levels of cy ##tok ##ines due to increased inflammation in patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 disease . on the other hand , obesity represents a state of low - grade inflammation , with various inflammatory products directly ex ##cre ##ted by adi ##pose tissue . in this con ##cise report we aimed to assess common elements of obesity and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods literature search on obesity and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . results we present “ me ##chan ##istic ” obesity - related problems that ag ##gra ##vate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection as well as tentative inflammatory / metabolic links between these diseases . conclusion obesity and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 share common elements of the inflammatory process ( and possibly also metabolic disturbances ) , ex ##ace ##rba ##ting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in the obe ##se .  
abstract background our understanding of climate factors and their links to the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak ##s is incomplete . this study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of mer ##s - co ##v cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors . methods the study used aggregate ##d monthly mer ##s - co ##v cases that reported to the saudi center for disease prevention and control from the ri ##yad ##h region between november 1 , 2012 and december 31 , 2018 . data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on google reports on the ri ##yad ##h region ( 24 . 71 ##36 ##° ##n , 46 . 67 ##53 ##° ##e ) . the po ##isson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio ( ir ##r ) and its 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) for each climate factor . results a total of 71 ##2 mer ##s - co ##v cases were included in the analysis ( mean age 54 . 2 ##± ##9 . 9 years ) , and more than half ( 404 ) ( 56 . 1 % ) mer ##s - co ##v cases were diagnosed during a five - month period from april to august . the highest peak timing positioned in august 2015 , followed by april 2014 , june 2017 , march 2015 , and june 2016 . high temperatures ( ir ##r = 1 . 05 ##4 , 95 % ci : 1 . 04 ##3 – 1 . 06 ##5 ) and a high ultraviolet index ( ir ##r = 1 . 401 , 95 % ci : 1 . 331 – 1 . 475 ) were correlated with a higher incidence of mer ##s - co ##v cases . however , low relative humidity ( ir ##r = 0 . 95 ##6 , 95 % ci : 0 . 94 ##8 – 0 . 96 ##4 ) and low wind speed ( ir ##r = 0 . 94 ##5 , 95 % ci : 0 . 91 ##2 – 0 . 97 ##9 ) were correlated with a lower incidence of mer ##s - co ##v cases . conclusion the novel corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v , is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between april and august . high temperature , high ultraviolet index , low wind speed , and low relative humidity are contributors to increased mer ##s - co ##v cases . the climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection .  
abstract background the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly recognized zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus . current evidence confirms the role of dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases . however , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or sub ##cl ##ini ##cal cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community . methods archived human sera ( 74 ##6 ##1 ) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of saudi arabia were obtained for mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce investigation . samples were tested for mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 - specific antibodies ( abs ) by elisa and confirmed by testing for neutral ##izing abs ( na ##bs ) using both pseudo ##type ##d and live virus neutral ##ization ass ##ays . results out of 74 ##6 ##1 samples , 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were elisa positive ( 2 . 3 % , 95 % ci 2 . 0 – 2 . 7 ) . presence of na ##bs was confirmed in 17 samples ( 0 . 23 % , 95 % ci 0 . 1 – 0 . 4 ) of which one sample exhibited po ##sit ##ivity in both neutral ##ization ass ##ays . confirmed ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity was identified in young ( 15 – 44 years ) men and women from saudi arabia , egypt , yemen , pakistan , palestine , sudan , and india without significant preference . conclusions an increasing trend of mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce was observed in the general population in western saudi arabia , suggesting that as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild infections might exist and act as an un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed source of infection . ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity of individuals from different nationalities under ##sco ##res the potential mer ##s export ##ation outside of the arabian peninsula . thus , enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warrant ##ed .  
abstract background and objectives middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries . media speculation ##s may have increased this psychological distress . the healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection . this study is the first to explore mer ##s - co ##v epidemic impact on medical students ’ perception and deter ##mina ##nts of their psychological distress during this outbreak . methods we randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the college of medicine at king sa ##ud university , ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia . a pre ##des ##ign ##ed question ##naire was answered by participants , and the collected data were statistical ##ly analyzed . results one hundred and seventy - four ( 87 % ) responded . female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males ( p < 0 . 001 ) . participants had a mean ga ##d score of 2 . 7 ± 3 . 1 and a median of 2 . perceived su ##ffi ##ciency of information score was the highest mean and median ( 17 . 4 ± 4 . 2 and 18 respectively ) . college and hospital announcements were the most common source of information ( 25 . 4 % ) . one hundred and thirty - four ( 77 % ) reported minimal anxiety , thirty - two ( 18 . 4 % ) reported mild anxiety , 8 ( 4 . 6 % ) reported moderate anxiety , and none of them reported severe anxiety ( score > 14 ) . the stress level ( as reported on 1 – 10 scale ) shows significant correlation with generalized anxiety disorder ( ga ##d - 7 ) score . we found in this study that significant predict ##ors in our model , in terms of more significant to the least , were : an increased self - report on h ##y ##gie ##nic habits , self - reported social avoidance , the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gan ##der while other variables including numbers of resources access , agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on mer ##s - co ##v all were found to be non - significant . however , the number of accessed resources , as per students , has border ##line significant correlation with higher self - reported anxiety from mer ##s - co ##v . conclusions medical students ’ psychological needs during the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak should be addressed appropriately . our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak .  
abstract introduction middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , is an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance . this review describes the latest mer ##s - co ##v clusters and the first cases of nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission within health care facilities in oman . we have highlighted lessons learned and proposed steps to prevent healthcare - associated infections . methods a descriptive analysis of mer ##s - co ##v cases was conducted between january 23 and february 16 , 2019 . the data from officials and other published sources used . results thirteen laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorate ##s without an ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link between the clusters . two clusters were reported from north al bat ##ina ##h governorate , with nine cases ( 69 % ) and 1 cluster from south ash sha ##r ##qi ##yah governorate with four cases ( 31 % ) . in total , four deaths were reported ( case fatal ##ity rate 31 % ) . four cases ( 31 % ) reported were household contacts from the first cluster , 3 ( 23 % ) were nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission in health care facilities ( two for first and one from the second cluster ) and 7 ( 54 % ) were community - acquired cases . conclusions the first local clusters of mer ##s - co ##v reported with evidence suggest ##ive of healthcare and household - associated transmission . early diagnosis and strict implementation of infection control measures remain fundamental in preventing and managing mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract introduction mer ##s is caused by a viral infection , which was first identified in ks ##a , 2012 . mer ##s - co ##v infection consequences with either hospital ##ization or death . methods all positive mer ##s - co ##v cases that diagnosed in and reported to a refer ##ral hospital in na ##j ##ran , ks ##a from march / 2014 to december / 2018 were revised retrospective ##ly . we identified patients from infection control department and medical records . demographic , clinical , and outcome data were collected . results of the 54 positive mer ##s - co ##v cases , 3 cases were excluded because no available data . therefore , the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases ( 94 . 4 ) . most of the patients were saudi 36 ( 70 . 6 % ) , and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 ( 35 . 3 ) season . fever 47 ( 92 . 2 % ) , cough 44 ( 86 . 3 % ) , and short ##ness of breath 37 ( 72 . 5 % ) were reported as most common symptoms . most patients had d ##m and hyper ##tension . overall mortality rate was 37 . 3 % , and interesting ##ly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years . in log ##istic regression analysis , season and chronic kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistical ##ly significantly associated with death . the odds of death the patients infected by mer ##s - co ##v during autumn and winter season were 4 . 09 times higher than those patients who infected during spring and summer season ( or = 4 . 09 , ci 1 . 18 - 14 . 15 , p < 0 . 02 ##6 ) . compared with mer ##s - co ##v patients who had non - chronic kidney diseases , the odds of death the mer ##s - co ##v patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18 . 08 times higher ( or = 18 . 08 , ci - 2 . 01 - 162 . 99 , p < 0 . 01 ) . conclusion the mortality rate of mer ##s - co ##v infection was high . further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the reasons behind the decrease in the mortality rate over the time period .  
summary the outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) emerged in china and rapidly spread worldwide . to prevent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dissemination , understanding the in vivo characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a high priority . we report a fe ##rret model of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and transmission that rec ##ap ##it ##ulates aspects of human disease . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected fe ##rret ##s exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication . although fatalities were not observed , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected fe ##rret ##s shed virus in nasal wash ##es , saliva , urine , and fe ##ces up to 8 days post - infection . at 2 days post - contact , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was detected in all naive direct contact fe ##rret ##s . furthermore , a few naive indirect contact fe ##rret ##s were positive for viral rna , suggesting airborne transmission . viral antigen ##s were detected in nasal tu ##rbin ##ate , tr ##ache ##a , lungs , and int ##est ##ine with acute bro ##nch ##iol ##itis present in infected lungs . thus , fe ##rret ##s represent an infection and transmission animal model of co ##vid - 19 that may facilitate development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 therapeutic ##s and vaccines .  
summary the ongoing pan ##de ##mic of co ##vid - 19 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , under ##sco ##res the urgency to develop experimental systems for studying this virus and identifying counter ##me ##as ##ures . we report a reverse genetic system for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . seven compliment ##ary dna ( cd ##na ) fragments spanning the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome were assembled into a full - genome cd ##na . rna transcribed from the full - genome cd ##na was highly infectious after electro ##por ##ation into cells , producing 2 . 9 × 106 plaque - forming unit ( p ##fu ) / ml of virus . compared with a clinical isolate , the infectious - clone - derived sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( ic ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) exhibited similar plaque morphology , viral rna profile , and replication kinetic ##s . additionally , ic ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 retained engineered molecular markers and did not acquire other mutations . we generated a stable mn ##eon ##gree ##n sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( ic ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - mn ##g ) by introducing this reporter gene into or ##f ##7 of the viral genome . ic ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - mn ##g was successfully used to evaluate the anti ##vira ##l activities of inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) . collectively , the reverse genetic system and reporter virus provide key re ##age ##nts to study sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and develop counter ##me ##as ##ures .  
abstract the infection of a novel corona ##virus found in wu ##han of china ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is rapidly spreading , and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide . due to the lack of effective treatment options for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , various strategies are being tested in china , including drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing . in this study , we used our pre - trained deep learning - based drug - target interaction model called molecule transform ##er - drug target interaction ( mt - dt ##i ) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the result showed that ata ##zan ##avi ##r , an anti ##ret ##rov ##ira ##l medication used to treat and prevent the human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) , is the best chemical compound , showing an inhibitor ##y pot ##ency with k ##d of 94 . 94 nm against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##c - like protein ##ase , followed by re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( 113 . 13 nm ) , e ##fa ##vir ##en ##z ( 199 . 17 nm ) , ri ##ton ##avi ##r ( 204 . 05 nm ) , and do ##lu ##te ##gra ##vir ( 336 . 91 nm ) . interesting ##ly , lo ##pina ##vir , ri ##ton ##avi ##r , and dar ##una ##vir are all designed to target viral protein ##ase ##s . however , in our prediction , they may also bind to the replication complex components of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with an inhibitor ##y pot ##ency with k ##d < 1 , 000 nm . in addition , we also found that several anti ##vira ##l agents , such as ka ##let ##ra ( lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r ) , could be used for the treatment of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . overall , we suggest that the list of anti ##vira ##l drugs identified by the mt - dt ##i model should be considered , when establishing effective treatment strategies for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract corona ##virus disease 2019 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a zoo ##not ##ic virus causing a variety of severe respiratory diseases . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is closest to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v in structure . the high prevalence of co ##vid - 19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset . our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , symptoms , treatment and prevention . whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alter ##nation of nu ##cle ##otide ##s and amino acid sequences . we evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different corona ##virus ##es using bas ##t and ma ##ff ##t software . we also selected seven types of structural proteins . we conclude that co ##vid - 19 might produce new mutations , specifically in g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , so caution and complete preparation by health authorities is required .  
abstract an outbreak infection with the novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has developed in wu ##han since december 2019 . this paper describes the first critical case in gan ##su china .  
abstract the beginning of the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 human corona ##virus in wu ##han , china , has triggered a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak ( co ##vid - 19 ) . by april 07 , 2020 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has affected more than 1 . 36 million people worldwide and caused more than 75 , 900 deaths . to date , the anti - malaria drug hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e found to be a treatment option for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in addition to supportive treatment , such as oxygen supply in moderate cases and extra ##corp ##ore ##al membrane oxygen ##ation in critically ill patients , unique medications for this condition are also under investigation . here we reviewed the antibody therapy might be an immediate strategy for emergency prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 therapy .  
abstract the recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in december 2019 raised global health concerns . the viral 3 - ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) enzyme controls corona ##virus replication and is essential for its life cycle . 3 ##cl ##pro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is very similar to that of sar ##s - co ##v . therefore , here ##in , we anal ##yse ##d the 3 ##cl ##pro sequence , constructed its 3d homo ##logy model , and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32 , 297 potential anti - viral ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als / traditional chinese medicinal compounds . our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 lead molecules for further opt ##imi ##sation and drug development process to combat co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract introduction there is growing evidence that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can gain access to the central nervous system ( cn ##s ) . we rev ##ise the literature on corona ##virus infection of the cn ##s associated with neurological diseases . development neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v epidemic ##s , although isolated cases were described . there are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with co ##v - o ##c ##43 and co ##v - 229 ##e infection . the presence of neurological lesions , especially dem ##ye ##lina ##ting lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model , may explain the mechanisms by which corona ##virus ##es enter the cn ##s , particularly those related with the immune response . this may explain the presence of corona ##virus in patients with multiple sc ##ler ##osis . we review the specific characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater cn ##s involvement . conclusion although neurological symptoms are not frequent in corona ##virus epidemic ##s , the high number of patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the cn ##s and increase the likelihood of early - or delayed - onset neurological symptoms . follow - up of patients affected by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the cn ##s .  
abstract development of anti - severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) agents is pivotal to prevent the re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of the life - threatening disease , sar ##s . in this study , more than 200 extracts from chinese medicinal herbs were evaluated for anti - sar ##s - co ##v activities using a cell - based ass ##ay that measured sar ##s - co ##v - induced cy ##top ##ath ##ogenic effect ( cp ##e ) in vitro on ve ##ro e ##6 cells . six herbal extracts , one each from gen ##tian ##ae ra ##di ##x ( 龍 [UNK] long dan ; the dried r ##hi ##zo ##me of gen ##tian ##a sc ##ab ##ra ) , di ##os ##core ##ae r ##hi ##zo ##ma ( 山 [UNK] shan yao ; the tube ##r of di ##os ##core ##a bat ##ata ##s ) , cass ##iae se ##men ( [UNK] 明 子 ju ##e ming z ##i ; the dried seed of cass ##ia tor ##a ) and lo ##rant ##hi ram ##us ( [UNK] [UNK] 生 sang ji sheng ; the dried stem , with leaf of taxi ##llus chin ##ensis ) ( designated as gs ##h , db ##m , ct ##h and tc ##h , respectively ) , and two from r ##hi ##zo ##ma ci ##bot ##ii ( [UNK] [UNK] go ##u ji ; the dried r ##hi ##zo ##me of ci ##bot ##ium bar ##ome ##tz ) ( designated as cbe and cb ##m ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v at concentrations between 25 and 200 ##μ ##g / ml . the concentrations of the six extracts needed to inhibit 50 % of ve ##ro e ##6 cell proliferation ( cc ##50 ) and 50 % of viral replication ( ec ##50 ) were determined . the resulting selective index values ( si = cc ##50 / ec ##50 ) of the most effective extracts cbe , gs ##h , db ##m , ct ##h and tc ##h were > 59 . 4 , > 57 . 5 , > 62 . 1 , > 59 . 4 , and > 92 . 9 , respectively . among these extracts , cb ##m and db ##m also showed significant inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se activity with ic ##50 values of 39 ##μ ##g / ml and 44 ##μ ##g / ml , respectively . our findings suggest that these six herbal extracts may have potential as candidates for future development of anti - sar ##s therapeutic ##s .  
abstract background corona ##virus ##es pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , and co ##vid - 19 . sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and the novel corona ##virus , previously dubbed 2019 - nc ##ov , and now officially named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , are the ca ##usa ##tive agents of the sar ##s , mer ##s , and co ##vid - 19 disease outbreak ##s , respectively . safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long - lasting virus - specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed . the corona ##virus spike ( s ) protein , a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope , is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of corona ##virus infection . methods we first generated cod ##on opt ##imi ##zed mer ##s - s ##1 subunit vaccines fused with a fold ##on trim ##eri ##zation domain to mimic the native viral structure . in variant construct ##s , we engineered immune st ##im ##ula ##nts ( rs ##0 ##9 or flag ##elli ##n , as t ##lr ##4 or t ##lr ##5 ago ##nist ##s , respectively ) into this trim ##eric design . we comprehensive ##ly tested the pre - clinical im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of mer ##s - co ##v vaccines in mice when delivered sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly by traditional needle injection , or intra ##cut ##aneous ##ly by di ##sso ##lving micro ##nee ##dle arrays ( mn ##as ) by evaluating virus specific i ##gg antibodies in the serum of va ##cci ##nated mice by elisa and using virus neutral ##ization ass ##ays . driven by the urgent need for co ##vid - 19 vaccines , we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop mn ##a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre - clinical im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity in vivo by exploit ##ing our substantial experience with mn ##a mer ##s - co ##v vaccines . findings here we describe the development of mn ##a delivered mer ##s - co ##v vaccines and their pre - clinical im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . specifically , mn ##a delivered mer ##s - s ##1 subunit vaccines eli ##cite ##d strong and long - lasting antigen - specific antibody responses . building on our ongoing efforts to develop mer ##s - co ##v vaccines , promising im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of mn ##a - delivered mer ##s - co ##v vaccines , and our experience with mn ##a fabrication and delivery , including clinical trials , we rapidly designed and produced clinical ##ly - trans ##lat ##able mn ##a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ##1 sequence
abstract the set of measures proposed by sep ##d , ae ##eh , get ##ec ##cu and ae ##g are aimed to help departments in their res ##ump ##tion of usual activity . we have prepared a number of practical recommendations regarding patient management and the step ##wise res ##ump ##tion of healthcare activity . these recommendations are based on the sparse , changing evidence available , and will be updated in the future according to daily needs and the availability of ex ##pen ##dable materials to suit them ; in each department they will be implemented depending upon the cumulative incidence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in each region , and the burden the pan ##de ##mic has represented for each hospital . the general objectives of these recommendations include : • to protect our patients against the risks of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and to provide them with high - quality care . • to protect all healthcare professionals against the risks of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . • to resume normal functioning of our departments in a setting of ongoing risk for infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract homo ##logy between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral - or vaccine - induced auto ##im ##mun ##ity . failure of sar ##s and mer ##s vaccines in animal trials involved pathogen ##esis consistent with an im ##mun ##ological pri ##ming that could involve auto ##im ##mun ##ity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the sar ##s and mer ##s spike protein . exposure pathogen ##esis to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in co ##vid - 19 likely will lead to similar outcomes . im ##mun ##ogenic peptide ##s in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogen ##ic pri ##ming peptide ##s ( similar to the more diffuse idea of “ immune enhancement ” ) . here i provide an assessment of potential for human pathogen ##esis via auto ##im ##mun ##ity via exposure , via infection or injection . sar - co ##v - 2 spike proteins , and all other sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins , im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes in each sar ##s - co ##v - 2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homo ##log ##ous matching . only one im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pe in a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 had no homo ##logy to human proteins . if all of the parts of the ep ##ito ##pes that are homo ##log ##ous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogen ##ic pri ##ming , the remaining im ##mun ##ogenic parts of the ep ##ito ##pes may be still im ##mun ##ogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development . mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in co ##vid - 19 disease . it also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself , targeting elements of m ##hc class i and class ii antigen presentation , pd - 1 signaling , cross - presentation of soluble ex ##ogen ##ous antigen ##s and the er - ph ##ago ##some pathway . translation ##al consequences of these findings are explored .  
abstract as of march 12th italy has the largest number of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cases in europe as well as outside china . the infections , first limited in northern italy , have eventually spread to all other regions . when controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is essential to know the key ep ##ide ##mi ##ological parameters , such as the basic reproduction number r 0 , i . e . the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his / her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak . previous work has been limited to the assessment of r 0 analyzing data from the wu ##han region or mainland china . in the present study the r 0 value for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was assessed analyzing data derived from the early phase of the outbreak in italy . in particular , the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was analyzed in 9 cities ( those with the largest number of infections ) fitting the well - established sir - model to available data in the interval between february 25 – march 12 , 2020 . the findings of this study suggest that r 0 values associated with the italian outbreak may range from 2 . 43 to 3 . 10 , confirming previous evidence in the literature reporting similar r 0 values for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract the recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) resulting from a distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) continues to evolve in many countries and pose life - threatening clinical issues to global public health . while the lungs are the primary target for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - mediated path ##ological consequence , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficit ##s . in the later stage , co ##vid - 19 can progress to pneumonia , acute respiratory failure , neurological deficit ##s and multi - organ dysfunction ##s leading to death . though a significant portion of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected individuals has been recovering from path ##ological symptoms , the impact of the co ##vid - 19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs , heart , brain and other organs at the post - recovery state remains unknown . presently , there is an urgent need for a re ##media ##l measure to combat this devastating co ##vid - 19 . bot ##ulin ##um toxin ##s ( bon ##ts ) are potent ne ##uro ##to ##xin ##s that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human . however , a mild dose of the pu ##rified form of bon ##t has been known to at ##ten ##uate chronic cough , d ##ys ##p ##no ##ea , pneumonia , acute respiratory failure , abnormal circulation , cardiac defects and various neurological deficit ##s that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of co ##vid - 19 . considering the fact , this review article provides 1 ) an overview on the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mediated path ##ological impact on the lungs , heart and brain , 2 ) signifies the therapeutic uses of bon ##ts against pulmonary failure , cardiac arrest and neurological deficit ##s , and 3 ) emphasize the rational ##ity for the possible use of bon ##t to prevent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and manage co ##vid - 19 .  
summary background severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was reported from china in january , 2020 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and , in 2 months , has caused more than 82 000 laboratory - confirmed cases of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) and 280 ##0 deaths in 46 countries . the total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . although both co ##vid - 19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) manifest as pneumonia , co ##vid - 19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission , fewer cases of dia ##rr ##hoe ##a , increased mental confusion , and a lower crude fatal ##ity rate . however , the underlying virus – host interactive characteristics con ##fer ##ring these observations on trans ##mis ##sibility and clinical manifestation ##s of co ##vid - 19 remain unknown . methods we systematically investigated the cellular su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , species tr ##op ##ism , replication kinetic ##s , and cell damage of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and compared findings with those for sar ##s - co ##v . we compared sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v replication in different cell lines with one - way an ##ova . for the area under the curve comparison between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v replication in cal ##u ##3 ( pulmonary ) and ca ##co ##2 ( int ##estinal ) cells , we used student ' s t test . we anal ##yse ##d cell damage induced by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v with one - way an ##ova . findings sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected and replicate ##d to comparable levels in human ca ##co ##2 cells and cal ##u ##3 cells over a period of 120 h ( p = 0 · 52 ) . by contrast , sar ##s - co ##v infected and replicate ##d more efficiently in ca ##co ##2 cells than in cal ##u ##3 cells under the same multi ##plicity of infection ( p = 0 · 00 ##9 ##8 ) . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , but not sar ##s - co ##v , replicate ##d modest ##ly in u2 ##51 ( ne ##uron ##al ) cells ( p = 0 · 03 ##6 ) . for animal species cell tr ##op ##ism , both sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replicate ##d in non - human primate , cat , rabbit , and pig cells . sar ##s - co ##v , but not sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , infected and replicate ##d in rhino ##lo ##phus
rec ##om ##bina ##tion is a process that un ##link ##s neighbouring lo ##ci allowing for independent evolutionary tr ##aj ##ect ##ories within genome ##s of many organisms . if not properly accounted for , rec ##om ##bina ##tion can compromise many evolutionary analyses . in addition , when dealing with organisms that are not ob ##liga ##tel ##y sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing , rec ##om ##bina ##tion gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineage ##s come into contact . since june , 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused 110 ##6 laboratory - confirmed infections , with 421 mer ##s - co ##v associated deaths as of april 16 , 2015 . although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoo ##not ##ic beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the middle east . in this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that mer ##s - co ##v genome has likely undergone numerous rec ##om ##bina ##tions recently . rec ##om ##bina ##tion in mer ##s - co ##v implies frequent co - infection with distinct lineage ##s of mer ##s - co ##v , probably in camel ##s given the current understanding of mer ##s - co ##v ep ##ide ##mi ##ology .  
abstract ##mi ##ddle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic virus from camel ##s causing significant mortality and mor ##bid ##ity in humans in the arabian peninsula . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the virus remains poorly understood , and while case - based and ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic , viral sequence data have not been ut ##ilised to their full potential . here we use existing mer ##s - co ##v sequence data to explore its ph ##yl ##od ##yna ##mics in two of its known major hosts , humans and camel ##s . we employ structured coal ##es ##cent models to show that long - term mer ##s - co ##v evolution occurs exclusively in camel ##s , whereas humans act as a transient , and ultimately terminal host . by anal ##ys ##ing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoo ##not ##ic introduction times we show that human outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula are driven by seasonal ##ly varying zoo ##not ##ic transfer of viruses from camel ##s . without here ##to ##for ##e unseen evolution of host tr ##op ##ism , mer ##s - co ##v is unlikely to become endemic in humans .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es en ##code a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogen ##esis , raising the possibility for common targets for at ##ten ##uation and therapeutic design . in this study , we focus on the highly conserved non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein ( ns ##p ) 16 , a viral 2 ’ o methyl - transfer ##ase ( mt ##ase ) that en ##codes critical functions in immune modulation and infection . using reverse genetics , we disrupted a key motif in the conserved k ##d ##ke motif of mer ##s ns ##p ##16 ( d ##13 ##0 ##a ) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogen ##esis . while the absence of 2 ’ o mt ##ase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in ve ##ro cells , the mer ##s d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant demonstrated significant at ##ten ##uation relative to control both in primary human air ##way cultures and in vivo . further examination indicated the mer ##s d ##ns ##p ##16 mutant had a type i if ##n based at ##ten ##uation and was partially restored in the absence of if ##it molecules . importantly , the robust at ##ten ##uation permitted use of mer ##s d ##ns ##p ##16 as a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted mer ##s - co ##v strain . these studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2 ’ o mt ##ase activity for co ##v pathogen ##esis and highlight ns ##p ##16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live at ##ten ##uated vaccine design in an expanding co ##v outbreak setting . significance ##cor ##ona ##virus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health , as evidenced by the sudden emergence of sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , pe ##d ##v and sw ##ine delta corona ##virus in the 21st century . these studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2 ’ o methyl - transfer ##ase activity of corona ##virus ##es for at ##ten ##uation . with clear understanding of the if ##n / if ##it based mechanism , ns ##p ##16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live at ##ten ##uated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emerge ##nt co ##v strains . importantly , other approaches targeting other conserved pan - corona ##virus functions have not yet proven effective against mer ##s - co ##v , illustrating the broad app ##lica ##bility of targeting viral 2 ’ o mt ##ase function across corona ##virus ##es .  
abstract ##in this study , we reported for the first time the existence of complement ##ed pali ##nd ##rom ##e small rna ##s ( cp ##sr ##nas ) and proposed cp ##sr ##nas and pali ##nd ##rom ##e small rna ##s ( ps ##rna ##s ) as a novel class of small rna ##s . the first discovered cp ##sr ##na uc ##u ##u ##ua ##aca ##ag ##cu ##ug ##u ##ua ##aa ##ga from sar ##s corona ##virus named sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 22 contained 22 nu ##cle ##otide ##s perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence . further sequence analysis supported that sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 22 originated from bat beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . the results of rna ##i experiments showed that one 19 - nt segment of sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 22 significantly induced cell ap ##op ##tosis . these results suggested that sar ##s - co ##v - cp ##sr - 22 could play a role in sar ##s - co ##v infection or pathogen ##ici ##ty . the discovery of ps ##rna ##s and cp ##sr ##nas paved the way to find new markers for pathogen detection and reveal the mechanisms in the infection or pathogen ##ici ##ty from a different point of view . the discovery of ps ##rna ##s and cp ##sr ##nas also broad ##en the understanding of pali ##nd ##rom ##e motifs in animal of plant genome ##s .  
abstract ##mi ##ddle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a major emerging zoo ##not ##ic infectious disease . since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camel ##s to humans with 2 , 46 ##8 confirmed cases , causing 85 ##1 deaths . to date , there are no e ##ffi ##ca ##cious drugs and vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v , increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency . a critical step in the life cycle of mer ##s - co ##v is the fusion with the host cell with its spike ( s ) protein as main deter ##mina ##nt of viral entry . pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of s expose ##s its fusion peptide ( f ##p ) , which initiate ##s membrane fusion . previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) f ##p have shown that calcium ( ca ##2 + ) plays an important role for fu ##so ##genic activity via a ca ##2 + binding pocket with conserved g ##lu ##tam ##ic acid ( e ) and as ##par ##tic acid ( d ) residues . sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v f ##p share a high sequence homo ##logy and here , we investigated whether ca ##2 + is required for mer ##s - co ##v fusion by sub ##stituting e and d residues in the mer ##s - co ##v f ##p with neutral ##ly charged alan ##ines . upon verify ##ing mutant cell surface expression and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage , we tested the mutants ability to media ##te infection of pseudo - particles ( pp ##s ) on host cells without and with ca ##2 + . our results demonstrate that intra ##cellular ca ##2 + enhance ##s mer ##s - co ##v w ##t pp ##s infection by approximately two - fold and that e ##8 ##9 ##1 is a crucial residue for ca ##2 + interaction . electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to ca ##2 + increasing mer ##s - co ##v f ##p fusion - relevant membrane ordering . intriguing ##ly , iso ##thermal cal ##ori ##metry ti ##tra ##tion showed that mer ##s - co ##v f ##p binds one ca ##2 + , as opposed to sar ##s - co ##v f ##p which binds two . our data suggests that there are significant differences in f ##p - ca ##2 + interactions of mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v f ##p despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of ca ##2 + ions interacting with the f ##p has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus .  
abstract ##the recent outbreak of pneumonia in wu ##han , china caused by the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of in ##fect ##ing people . in this report , we introduced the v ##hp ( virus host prediction ) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm . our prediction suggests that 2019 - nc ##ov has close in ##fect ##ivity with other human corona ##virus ##es , especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . based on our prediction , compared to the corona ##virus ##es in ##fect ##ing other ve ##rte ##brates , bat corona ##virus ##es are assigned with more similar in ##fect ##ivity patterns with 2019 - nc ##ov ##s . furthermore , by comparing the in ##fect ##ivity patterns of all viruses hosted on ve ##rte ##brates , we found min ##k viruses show a closer in ##fect ##ivity pattern to 2019 - nc ##ov . these consequences of in ##fect ##ivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and min ##k may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019 - nc ##ov . these results warn us to be ##ware of 2019 - nc ##ov and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it . one sentence summary ##it is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of in ##fect ##ing human . guo et al . proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can in ##fect with dna sequence as input . applied to the wu ##han 2019 novel corona ##virus , our prediction demonstrated that several ve ##rte ##brate - infectious corona ##virus ##es have strong potential to in ##fect human . this method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogen ##s .  
since the sar ##s outbreak 18 years ago , a large number of severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##sr - co ##v ) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host , bats ##1 - 4 . previous studies indicated that some of those bat sar ##sr - co ##vs have the potential to in ##fect humans ##5 - 7 . here we report the identification and characterization of a novel corona ##virus ( nc ##ov - 2019 ) which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans , in wu ##han , china . the epidemic , started from december 12th , 2019 , has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by january 20th , 2020 . full - length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak . they are almost identical to each other and share 79 . 5 % sequence identify to sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , it was found that nc ##ov - 2019 is 96 % identical at the whole genome level to a bat corona ##virus . the pair ##wise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non - structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of sar ##sr - co ##v . the nc ##ov - 2019 virus was then isolated from the bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid of a critically ill patient , which can be neutral ##ized by sera from several patients . importantly , we have confirmed that this novel co ##v uses the same cell entry receptor , ace ##2 , as sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract ##over the past 20 years , several corona ##virus ##es have crossed the species barrier into humans , causing outbreak ##s of severe , and often fatal , respiratory illness . since sar ##s - co ##v was first identified in animal markets , global vi ##rom ##ics projects have discovered thousands of corona ##virus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions . unfortunately , there are few tools available to functional ##ly test these novel viruses for their ability to in ##fect humans , which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoo ##not ##ic viral outbreak . here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage b beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , such as sar ##s - co ##v and the recent 2019 - nc ##ov , for receptor usage and their ability to in ##fect cell types from different species . we show that host pro ##tea ##se processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage b viruses and that bypass ##ing this barrier allows several lineage b viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor . we also demonstrate how different lineage b viruses can rec ##om ##bine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ace ##2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019 - nc ##ov .  
abstract ##ther ##e is concern about a new corona ##virus , the 2019 - nc ##ov , as a global public health threat . in this article , we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analysis of this new virus . a phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019 - nc ##ov and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank ( 5 from sar ##s , 2 from mer ##s and 5 from bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ) . fu ##bar analysis shows that the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein has some sites under positive pressure while homo ##logy modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses . the phylogenetic tree showed that 2019 . nc ##ov significantly clustered with bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus sequence isolated in 2015 , whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in s and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins . from these results , 2019 ##nco ##v could be considered a corona ##virus distinct from sar ##s virus , probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to in ##fect humans .  
abstract ##20 ##19 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in wu ##han , china . investigations on the trans ##mis ##sibility , severity , and other features associated with this virus are ongoing . currently , there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection , and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen . in contrast , specific inhibitors targeting the key pro ##tea ##se involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic . the main pro ##tea ##se of sar ##s - co ##v is essential for the life cycle of the virus , which showed 96 . 1 % of similarity with the main pro ##tea ##se ##of 2019 - nc ##ov , is considered to be an attractive target for drug development . in this study , we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with sar ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se by high - through ##put screening based on the 8 , 000 clinical drug libraries , all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety , which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
abstract ##the newly identified 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has caused more than 800 laboratory - confirmed human infections , including 25 deaths , posing a serious threat to human health . currently , however , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l treatment or vaccine . considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v , it is urgent to assess the cross - react ##ivity of anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies with 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein , which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019 - nc ##ov . here , we report for the first time that a sar ##s - co ##v - specific human mono ##cl ##onal antibody , cr ##30 ##22 , could bind potent ##ly with 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d ( k ##d of 6 . 3 nm ) . the ep ##ito ##pe of cr ##30 ##22 does not overlap with the ace ##2 binding site within 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d . therefore , cr ##30 ##22 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutic ##s , alone or in combination with other neutral ##izing antibodies , for the prevention and treatment of 2019 - nc ##ov infections . interesting ##ly , some of the most potent sar ##s - co ##v - specific neutral ##izing antibodies ( e . g . , m3 ##9 ##6 , cr ##30 ##14 ) that target the ace ##2 binding site of sar ##s - co ##v failed to bind 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein , indicating that the difference in the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov has a critical impact for the cross - react ##ivity of neutral ##izing antibodies , and that it is still necessary to develop novel mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d .  
abstract ##nov ##el corona ##virus ( nc ##ov ) outbreak in the city of wu ##han , china during december 2019 , has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort . this human pathogen is a member of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus carrying 30 ki ##lo ##base of single positive - sense rna genome . understanding the evolution , zoo ##not ##ic transmission , and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts . the present study reported detailed analysis of 2019 - nc ##ov genome evolution and potential candidate peptide ##s for vaccine development . this nc ##ov gen ##otype might have been evolved from a bat - co ##v by acc ##um ##ulating non - synonymous mutations , ind ##els , and rec ##om ##bina ##tion events . structural proteins spike ( s ) , and membrane ( m ) had extensive mutation ##al changes , whereas envelope ( e ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures ex ##erted on 2019 - nc ##ov during evolution . interesting ##ly , 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein contains a 39 nu ##cle ##otide sequence insertion relative to sar ##s - like bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 / 2017 . furthermore , we identified eight high binding affinity ( h ##ba ) cd ##4 t - cell ep ##ito ##pes in the s , e , m and n proteins , which can be commonly recognized by h ##la - dr all ##eles of asia and asia - pacific region population . these im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes can be incorporated in universal subunit co ##v vaccine . diverse h ##la types and variations in the ep ##ito ##pe binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ological outcomes of circulating virus in humans . our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of co ##v strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogen ##ic co ##v strains .  
abstract ##wu ##han corona ##virus , called 2019 - nc ##ov , is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 96 ##9 ##2 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by january 30 , 2020 . currently , there is no effective treatment for this epidemic . however , the viral pro ##tea ##se of a corona ##virus is well - known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target . fortunately , the sequence identity of the 2019 - nc ##ov pro ##tea ##se and that of severe - acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is as high as 96 . 1 % . we show that the pro ##tea ##se inhibitor binding sites of 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v are almost identical , which means all potential anti - sar ##s - co ##v che ##mot ##her ##ap ##ies are also potential 2019 - nc ##ov drugs . here , we report a family of potential 2019 - nc ##ov drugs generated by a machine intelligence - based genera ##tive network complex ( g ##nc ) . the potential effectiveness of treating 2019 - nc ##ov by using some existing hiv drugs is also analyzed .  
abstract ##the emergence of a novel , highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus , 2019 - nc ##ov , in china , and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency . corona ##virus ##es use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nc ##ov - 2019 spike ( s ) - driven entry might facilitate assessment of pan ##de ##mic potential and reveal therapeutic targets . here , we demonstrate that 2019 - nc ##ov - s uses the sar ##s - corona ##virus receptor , ace ##2 , for entry and the cellular pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 for 2019 - nc ##ov - s pri ##ming . a t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option . finally , we show that the serum form a con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patient neutral ##ized 2019 - nc ##ov - s - driven entry . our results reveal important common ##ali ##ties between 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - corona ##virus infection , which might translate into similar trans ##mis ##sibility and disease pathogen ##esis . moreover , they identify a target for anti ##vira ##l intervention . one sentence summary ##the novel 2019 corona ##virus and the sar ##s - corona ##virus share central biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention .  
abstract ##20 ##19 - nc ##ov , which is a novel corona ##virus emerged in wu ##han , china , at the end of 2019 , has caused at least infected 11 , 84 ##4 as of feb 1 , 2020 . however , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l treatment or vaccine currently . very recently report had suggested that novel co ##v would use the same cell entry receptor , ace ##2 , as the sar ##s - co ##v . in this report , we generated a novel rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein by connecting the extra ##cellular domain of human ace ##2 to the fc region of the human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin i ##gg ##1 . an ace ##2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study . the fusion proteins were then characterized . both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov and ex ##erted desired ph ##arm ##aco ##logical properties . moreover , fusion proteins potent ##ly neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov in vitro . as these fusion proteins exhibit cross - react ##ivity against corona ##virus ##es , they could have potential applications for diagnosis , prop ##hyl ##ax ##is , and treatment of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
abstract ##the outbreak ##s of 2002 / 2003 sar ##s , 2012 / 2015 mer ##s and 2019 / 2020 wu ##han respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal corona ##virus ( co ##v ) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability , and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health . it is widely accepted that co ##v human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein ( s - protein ) with human receptor on host cell surface ; so , quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of co ##vs . however , quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking . here , we perform large - scale protein - protein docking to quan ##tify the interactions of 2019 - nc ##ov s - protein receptor - binding domain ( s - rb ##d ) with human receptor ace ##2 , based on experimental sar ##s - co ##v s - rb ##d - ace ##2 complex structure . by sampling a large number of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic ##ally probable binding conform ##ations with monte carlo algorithm , this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest - energy receptor - binding conform ##ations , and hence established an experiment - based strength reference for evaluating the receptor - binding affinity of 2019 - nc ##ov via comparison with sar ##s - co ##v . our results show that this binding affinity is about 73 % of that of sar ##s - co ##v , supporting that 2019 - nc ##ov may cause human transmission similar to that of sar ##s - co ##v . thus , this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged co ##v and its mutant strains , and demonstrates that post - genome analysis of protein - protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control .  
the 2019 - nc ##ov is reported to share the same entry ( ace ##2 ) as sar ##s - co ##v according to the updated findings . analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of corona ##virus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and post - infection modulation . in this study , we found that the expression of ace ##2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different , suggesting relatively similar su ##sc ##ept ##ibility , which was consistent with current clinical observations . moreover , based on the expression of ace ##2 in smoking individuals , we in ##fer ##red that long - term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019 - nc ##ov . analyzing the ace ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells suggested that ace ##2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post - infection regulation , including immune response , cy ##tok ##ine secret ##ion , and viral genome replication . we also constructed protein - protein interaction ( pp ##i ) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cy ##tok ##ine secret ##ion . our findings could explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinic ##ians and researchers understand the pathogen ##esis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019 - nc ##ov .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) , including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , lead global epidemic ##s with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . however , there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019 - nc ##ov . drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing , represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs , could short ##en the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery . in this study , we present an int ##eg ##rative , anti ##vira ##l drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing methodology implementing a systems ph ##arm ##aco ##logy - based network medicine platform , quan ##tify ##ing the inter ##play between the hc ##ov - host interact ##ome and drug targets in the human protein - protein interaction network . phylogenetic analyses of 15 hc ##ov whole genome ##s reveal that 2019 - nc ##ov has the highest nu ##cle ##otide sequence identity with sar ##s - co ##v ( 79 . 7 % ) among the six other known pathogen ##ic hc ##ov ##s . specifically , the envelope and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins of 2019 - nc ##ov are two evolution ##ari ##ly conserved regions , having the sequence identities of 96 % and 89 . 6 % , respectively , compared to sar ##s - co ##v . using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known hc ##ov - host interactions in the human protein - protein interact ##ome , we computational ##ly identified 135 put ##ative rep ##ur ##po ##sable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of hc ##ov ##s . in addition , we prior ##iti ##zed 16 potential anti - hc ##ov rep ##ur ##po ##sable drugs ( including mel ##aton ##in , mer ##cap ##top ##uri ##ne , and sir ##oli ##mus ) that were further valid ##ated by enrichment analyses of drug - gene signatures and hc ##ov - induced transcript ##omics data in human cell lines . finally , we showcased three potential drug combinations ( including sir ##oli ##mus plus da ##ct ##ino ##my ##cin , mer ##cap ##top ##uri ##ne plus mel ##aton ##in , and tore ##mi ##fen ##e plus em ##od ##in ) captured by the complementary exposure pattern : the targets of the drugs both hit the hc ##ov - host sub ##net ##work , but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein - protein interact ##ome network . in summary , this study offers powerful network - based method ##ologies for rapid identification of candidate rep ##ur ##po ##sable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for hc ##ov ##s .  
abstract ##the beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of co ##vid - 19 outbreak caused by a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . there is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread . in this study , we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by considering the high genetic similarity between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v , which caused the outbreak in 2003 , and lever ##aging existing im ##mun ##ological studies of sar ##s - co ##v . by screening the experimental ##ly - determined sar ##s - co ##v - derived b cell and t cell ep ##ito ##pes in the im ##mun ##ogenic structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , we identified a set of b cell and t cell ep ##ito ##pes derived from the spike ( s ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins that map identical ##ly to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins . as no mutation has been observed in these identified ep ##ito ##pes among the available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences ( as of 9 february 2020 ) , immune targeting of these ep ##ito ##pes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus . for the t cell ep ##ito ##pes , we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated m ##hc all ##eles and proposed a set of ep ##ito ##pes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally , as well as in china . our findings provide a screened set of ep ##ito ##pes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) pneumonia first emerged in wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china , in december 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the receptor for sar ##s - co ##v and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019 - nc ##ov . paradox ##ically , ace ##2 expression in the lung protects mice from sar ##s - co ##v spike protein induced lung injury by at ##ten ##uating the ren ##in - ang ##iot ##ens ##in system . in the int ##est ##ine , ace ##2 also suppress ##es int ##estinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid home ##osta ##sis , anti ##mic ##ro ##bial peptide expression and ecology of the gut micro ##bio ##me . upon analysis of single cell - rna sequencing data from control subjects and those with coli ##tis or inflammatory bow ##el disease ( ib ##d ) , we found that ace ##2 expression in the colon ##ocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection , innate and cellular immunity , but was negatively associated with viral transcription , protein translation , humor ##al immunity , ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis and complement activation . in summary , we suggest that ace ##2 may play dual roles in media ##ting the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and immunity of 2019 - nc ##ov infection .  
abstract ##wu ##han novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading . to date , no anti ##vira ##l therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus . this study was conducted to design possible ep ##ito ##pe - based subunit vaccines against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus using the approaches of reverse va ##cci ##nology and im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics . upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine construct ##s were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . later , molecular dynamics simulation and in si ##lic ##o cod ##on adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine . hopefully , this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus .  
abstract ##the present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections , including respiratory distress syndrome , is the third spill ##over , in only two decades , of an animal corona ##virus to humans resulting in a major epidemic . here , the corona ##virus study group ( cs ##g ) of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming ( taxonomy ) of the corona ##vir ##idae family , assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019 - nc ##ov . based on ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , taxonomy and established practice , the cs ##g formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##vs ) of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus and designate ##s it as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . to facilitate communication , the cs ##g further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolate ##s : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / isolate / host / date / location . the spectrum of clinical manifestation ##s associated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections in humans remains to be determined . the independent zoo ##not ##ic transmission of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 highlights the need for studying the entire ( virus ) species to complement research focused on individual pathogen ##ic viruses of immediate significance . this research will improve our understanding of virus - host interactions in an ever - changing environment and enhance our prepared ##ness for future outbreak ##s .  
abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome co ##v - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) caused the corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) cases in china has become a public health emergency of international concern ( ph ##ei ##c ) . based on ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as cell entry receptor of sar ##s - co ##v , we used the ha ##ce ##2 trans ##genic mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to study the pathogen ##ici ##ty of the virus . weight loss and virus replication in lung were observed in ha ##ce ##2 mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the typical his ##top ##ath ##ology was inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia with in ##filtration of significant l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and mono ##cytes in al ##ve ##olar inter ##sti ##tium , and accumulation of macro ##pha ##ges in al ##ve ##olar ca ##vi ##ties . viral antigen ##s were observed in the bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##elial cells , al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges and al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elia . the phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . the pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ha ##ce ##2 mice was clarified and the koch ’ s post ##ulates were fulfilled as well , and the mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutic ##s and vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##at the end of 2019 , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 induce ##s an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in china ##1 , even more spread than sar ##s - co ##v infection ##2 . the entry of sar ##s - co ##v into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor ( ace ##2 ) recognition and spike protein cleavage - induced cell membrane fusion ##3 , 4 . the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 also binds to ace ##2 with a similar affinity , whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear ##5 , 6 . here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enhance ##s the cleavage efficiency , and besides pulmonary al ##ve ##oli , int ##estinal and es ##op ##ha ##gus ep ##ith ##eli ##um were also the target tissues of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . compared with sar ##s - co ##v , we found a sp ##rr insertion in the s ##1 / s ##2 pro ##tea ##se cleavage sites of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence ali ##gm ##ent and fur ##in score calculation . additionally , the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for pro ##tea ##se recognition by the homo ##logy modeling and mo ##lic ##ular docking . furthermore , the single - cell transcript ##ome ##s identified that ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##ss are highly coe ##x ##pressed in at ##2 cells of lung , along with es ##op ##ha ##ge ##al upper ep ##ith ##elial cells and abs ##or ##ptive enter ##ocytes . our results provide the bio ##in ##form ##atics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and indicate its potential target cells .  
the outbreak of the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) rapidly spread from wu ##han , china to more than 150 countries , areas or territories , causing staggering number of infections and deaths . a systematic prof ##iling of the immune vulnerability landscape of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism , peptide vaccine development , and anti ##vira ##l antibody development , is lacking . in this study , we investigated the potential of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral proteins to induce class i and ii m ##hc presentation and to form linear antibody ep ##ito ##pes . we created an online database to broadly share the predictions as a resource for the research community . using this resource , we showed that genetic variations in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , though still few for the moment , already follow the pattern of mutations in related corona ##virus ##es , and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus . importantly , we discovered evidence that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , along with related corona ##virus ##es , used mutations to evade attack from the human immune system . overall , we present an im ##mun ##ological resource for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that could promote both therapeutic development and me ##chan ##istic research .  
abstract ##the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on hub ##ei province , china and is a major public health concern . taxonomic ##ally 2019 - nc ##ov is closely related to sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - related bat corona ##virus ##es , and it appears to share a common receptor with sar ##s - co ##v ( ace - 2 ) . here , we perform structural modeling of the 2019 - nc ##ov spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v , despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module . compared to sar ##s - co ##v , we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding ( s ##1 ) and fusion ( s ##2 ) domains , which we predict to be pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally - sensitive . we suggest this loop con ##fers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with mer ##s - co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es , and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019 - nc ##ov may affect virus stability and transmission .  
the recent outbreak of a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in wu ##han , china , under ##sco ##res the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoo ##not ##ic viruses in humans . here , we show that rec ##om ##bina ##tion in beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , including human - in ##fect ##ing viruses like sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the spike gene . we find that this common process likely led to a rec ##om ##bina ##tion event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 involving the rb ##d . as a result of this rec ##om ##bina ##tion event , sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 share a similar gen ##otype in rb ##d , including two insertion ##s ( positions 43 ##2 - 43 ##6 and 460 - 47 ##2 ) , and all ##eles 42 ##7 ##n and 43 ##6 ##y . both 42 ##7 ##n and 43 ##6 ##y belong to a helix that interact ##s with the human ace ##2 receptor . ancestral state analyses revealed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with rat ##g ##13 by acc ##um ##ulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the rb ##d . in sum , we propose a two - hit scenario in the emergence of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus whereby the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v by incorporation of a sar ##s - like rb ##d through rec ##om ##bina ##tion before 2009 , and subsequently , the lineage that led to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 accumulated further , unique changes specifically in the rb ##d .  
abstract ##the outbreak of a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) represents a pan ##de ##mic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern . the co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines , therapeutic antibodies , and diagnostic ##s . to facilitate medical counter ##me ##as ##ure ( mc ##m ) development we determined a 3 . 5 a - resolution cry ##o - em structure of the 2019 - nc ##ov s trim ##er in the pre ##fusion conform ##ation . the predominant state of the trim ##er has one of the three receptor - binding domains ( rb ##ds ) rotated up in a receptor - accessible conform ##ation . we also show bio ##physical and structural evidence that the 2019 - nc ##ov s binds ace ##2 with higher affinity than sar ##s - co ##v s . additionally we tested several published sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and found that they do not have app ##re ##cia ##ble binding to nc ##ov - 2019 s , suggesting antibody cross - react ##ivity may be limited between the two virus rb ##ds . the atomic - resolution structure of 2019 - nc ##ov s should enable rapid development and evaluation of mc ##ms to address the ongoing public health crisis .  
background : the ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019 - nc ##ov is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak 17 years ago . during the 2002 - 2003 sar ##s outbreak , healthcare workers formed a special population of patients . although virus - specific i ##gg play important roles in virus neutral ##ization and prevention against future infection , limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of i ##gg after infection with sar ##s - like corona ##virus . methods : a long - term prospective co ##hort study followed 34 sar ##s - co ##v - infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002 - 2003 sar ##s outbreak in guangzhou , china , with a 13 - year follow - up . serum samples were collected annually from 2003 - 2015 . twenty sar ##s - co ##v - infected and 40 non - infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015 , and their serum samples were collected . all sera were tested for i ##gg antibodies with elisa using whole virus and a rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v , as a diagnostic antigen . results : anti sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg was found to persist for up to 12 years . i ##gg ti ##ters typically peaked in 2004 , declining rapidly from 2004 - 2006 , and then continued to decline at a slower rate . i ##gg ti ##ters in sar ##s - co ##v - infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015 . patients treated with co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids at the time of infection were found to have lower i ##gg ti ##ters than those without . conclusions : i ##gg antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v can persist for at least 12 years . the presence of sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg might provide protection against sar ##s - co ##v and other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . this study provides valuable information regarding humor ##al immune responses against sar ##s - co ##v and the 2019 - nc ##ov .  
pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus infections , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , cause high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality 1 , 2 . recently , a severe pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new corona ##virus was reported at december 2019 ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) in the city wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china ##3 – 5 , which was also named as pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome ( par ##s ) 6 . up to 9th of february 2020 , at least 37 , 251 cases have been reported with 81 ##2 fatal cases according to the report from china cdc . however , the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019 - nc ##ov is still unknown . here we show that after the 2019 - nc ##ov infection , cd ##4 + t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogen ##ic t help ##er ( th ) 1 cells and generate gm - cs ##f etc . the cy ##tok ##ines environment induce ##s inflammatory cd ##14 + cd ##16 + mono ##cytes with high expression of il - 6 and accelerate ##s the inflammation . these abe ##rran ##t and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality . our results demonstrate that excessive non - effective host immune responses by pathogen ##ic t cells and inflammatory mono ##cytes may associate with severe lung pathology . therefore , we suggest that mono ##cl ##onal antibody that targets the gm - cs ##f or inter ##le ##uki ##n 6 receptor may potentially curb im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology caused by 2019 - nc ##ov and consequently win more time for virus clearance .  
a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) first detected in wu ##han , china , has spread rapidly since december 2019 , causing more than 80 , 000 confirmed infections and 2 , 700 fatalities ( as of feb 27 , 2020 ) . imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pan ##de ##mic is likely . here , we explore how seasonal variation in trans ##mis ##sibility could mod ##ulate a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . data from routine diagnostic ##s show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic corona ##virus ##es ( 229 ##e , hk ##u ##1 , nl ##6 ##3 , o ##c ##43 ) and we parameter ##ize our model for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using these data . the model allows for many sub ##pop ##ulation ##s of different size with variable parameters . simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020 / 2021 . variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions . while the uncertainty in parameters is large , the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained . seasonal forcing on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission . the likely aggregate ##d effect of seasonal variation , infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pan ##de ##mic wave with lower prevalence at any given time , thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a global health concern as it continues to spread within china and beyond . the ca ##usa ##tive agent of this disease , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , belongs to the genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona ##virus ( sar ##sr - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome related corona ##virus ( mer ##sr - co ##v ) . cod ##on usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments . previous studies on cod ##on usage of influenza a viruses can help identify viral host origins and evolution trends , however , similar studies on corona ##virus ##es are lacking . in this study , global correspondence analysis ( ca ) , within - group correspondence analysis ( wc ##a ) and between - group correspondence analysis ( bc ##a ) were performed among different genes in corona ##virus viral sequences . the amino acid usage pattern of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was generally found similar to bat and human sar ##sr - co ##vs . however , we found greater synonymous cod ##on usage differences between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes , suggesting these two genes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v share a common human receptor ace ##2 . protein - protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike - rb ##d of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conform ##ation and binding free energy to ace ##2 . in vitro ass ##ays using rec ##om ##bina ##nt ace ##2 proteins and ace ##2 expressing cells confirmed the two corona ##virus ##es ’ similar binding af ##fin ##ities to ace ##2 . the above studies provide experimental supporting evidence ##s and possible explanation for the high trans ##mis ##sibility observed in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak . potent ace ##2 - blocking sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies showed limited cross - binding and neutral ##izing activities to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . ace ##2 - non - blocking sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d antibodies , though with weaker neutral ##izing activities against sar ##s - co ##v , showed positive cross - neutral ##izing activities to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with an unknown mechanism . these findings suggest a trade - off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different corona ##virus ##es , and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its future mutants .  
the new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) outbreak originating from wu ##han , china , poses a threat to global health . while it ' s evident that the virus invade ##s respiratory tract and transmit ##s from human to human through air ##way , other viral tr ##op ##isms and transmission routes remain unknown . we tested viral rna in stool from 73 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected hospitalized patients using rr ##t - pc ##r . 53 . 42 % of the patients tested positive in stool . 23 . 29 % of the patients remained positive in fe ##ces even after the viral rna decreased to und ##ete ##ctable level in respiratory tract . the viral rna was also detected in gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tissues . furthermore , gas ##tric , duo ##den ##al and rec ##tal ep ##ith ##elia showed positive im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent stain ##ing of viral host receptor ace ##2 and viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in a case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . our results provide evidence for gas ##tro ##int ##estinal infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , highlighting its potential fe ##cal - oral transmission route .  
abstract ##the outbreak of 2019 - nc ##ov in the central chinese city of wu ##han at the end of 2019 poses un ##pre ##cede ##nt public health challenges to both china and the rest world ##1 . the new corona ##virus shares high sequence identity to sar ##s - co ##v and a newly identified bat corona ##virus ##2 . while bats may be the reservoir host for various corona ##virus ##es , whether 2019 - nc ##ov has other hosts is still ambiguous . in this study , one corona ##virus isolated from malaya ##n pang ##olin ##s showed 100 % , 98 . 2 % , 96 . 7 % and 90 . 4 % amino acid identity with 2019 - nc ##ov in the e , m , n and s genes , respectively . in particular , the receptor - binding domain of the s protein of the pang ##olin - co ##v is virtually identical to that of 2019 - nc ##ov , with one amino acid difference . comparison of available genome ##s suggests 2019 - nc ##ov might have originated from the rec ##om ##bina ##tion of a pang ##olin - co ##v - like virus with a bat - co ##v - rat ##g ##13 - like virus . infected pang ##olin ##s showed clinical signs and his ##top ##ath ##ological changes , and the circulating antibodies reacted with the s protein of 2019 - nc ##ov . the isolation of a corona ##virus that is highly related to 2019 - nc ##ov in the pang ##olin ##s suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019 - nc ##ov . the newly identified corona ##virus in the most - traffic ##ked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled .  
a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus vaccine against the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was constructed , which contains fragments from the s , n , and or ##f ##8 genes . r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues im ##mun ##ized with the rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus generated antigen - specific humor ##al and cellular response . furthermore , the vaccine provided significant protection against subsequent live sar ##s - co ##v challenge . in contrast , three out of four monkeys im ##mun ##ized with place ##bo suffered severe al ##ve ##olar damage and pulmonary destruction .  
abstract ##the spread of the novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has triggered a global emergency , that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent es ##cala ##ting health , social and economic impacts . the spike protein ( s ) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ace ##2 , and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells ##1 . the s proteins from sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are similar ##2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) pre ##cl ##ude the use of sar ##s - co ##v - 1 – specific neutral ##izing antibodies to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 23 . here we used comparative pang ##eno ##mic analysis of all sequence ##d beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es to reveal that , among all core gene clusters present in these viruses , the envelope protein e shows a variant shared by sar ##s and sar ##s - co ##v ##2 with two completely - conserved key functional features , an ion - channel and a pd ##z - binding motif ( p ##bm ) . these features trigger a cy ##tok ##ine storm that activate ##s the in ##fl ##am ##mas ##ome , leading to increased ed ##ema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) 4 - 6 , the leading cause of death in sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ##7 , 8 . however , three drugs approved for human use may inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 protein e , either acting upon the ion channel ( ama ##nta ##dine and he ##xa ##met ##hyl ##ene ami ##lor ##ide ##9 , 10 ) or the p ##bm ( sb ##20 ##35 ##80 ##5 ) , thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host , as already demonstrated for sar ##s - co ##v - 1 ##in animal models . hence , blocking the sar ##s protein e inhibit ##s development of ar ##ds in vivo . given that our results demonstrate that the protein e sub ##cl ##ust ##er for the sar ##s clade is quasi - identical for the key functional regions of sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as sar ##s e protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from co ##vid - 2019 while vaccines and other prevent ##ive measures are being developed .  
abstracts ##in ##ce december , 2019 , an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has hit the city of wu ##han in the hub ##ei province . with the continuous development of the epidemic , it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent anti ##vira ##l treatments or vaccines . the spike protein on the corona ##virus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vital ##ity . previous studies showed that 2019 - nc ##ov is highly homo ##log ##ous to human sar ##s - co ##v and attache ##s host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) domain to the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ii ( ace ##2 ) . however , the molecular mechanisms of 2019 - nc ##ov binding to human ace ##2 and evolution of 2019 - nc ##ov remain unclear . in this study , we have extensively studied the rb ##d - ace ##2 complex , spike protein , and free rb ##d systems of 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v using protein - protein docking and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . it was shown that the rb ##d - ace ##2 binding free energy for 2019 - nc ##ov is significantly lower than that for sar ##s - co ##v , which is consistent with the fact that 2019 - nc ##ov is much more infectious than sar ##s - co ##v . in addition , the spike protein of 2019 - nc ##ov shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sar ##s - co ##v , suggesting that 2019 - nc ##ov is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than sar ##s - co ##v . this may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019 - nc ##ov because sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body - temperature than humans . it was also revealed that the rb ##d of 2019 - nc ##ov is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ace ##2 , compared to the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v . that means that 2019 - nc ##ov will be much more temperature - sensitive in terms of human infection than sar ##s - co ##v . with the rising temperature , 2019 - nc ##ov is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than sar ##s - co ##v , and get controlled more easily . the present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
abstract ##the outbreak of 2019 - nc ##ov pneumonia ( co ##vid - 19 ) in the city of wu ##han , china has resulted in more than 70 , 000 laboratory confirmed cases , and recent studies showed that 2019 - nc ##ov ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) could be of bat origin but involve other potential intermediate hosts . in this study , we assembled the genome ##s of corona ##virus ##es identified in sick pang ##olin ##s . the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pang ##olin corona ##virus ##es ( pang ##olin - co ##v ) are genetically related to both the 2019 - nc ##ov and bat corona ##virus ##es but do not support the 2019 - nc ##ov arose directly from the pang ##olin - co ##v . our study also suggested that pang ##olin be natural host of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , with a potential to in ##fect humans . large surveillance of corona ##virus ##es in pang ##olin ##s could improve our understanding of the spectrum of corona ##virus ##es in pang ##olin ##s . conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposure ##s of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spill ##over risks of corona ##virus ##es from wild animals to humans .  
abstract ##to explore potential intermediate host of a novel corona ##virus is vital to rapidly control continuous co ##vid - 19 spread . we found gen ##omic and evolutionary evidence ##s of the occurrence of 2019 - nc ##ov - like corona ##virus ( named as pang ##olin - co ##v ) from dead malaya ##n pang ##olin ##s . pang ##olin - co ##v is 91 . 02 % and 90 . 55 % identical at the whole genome level to 2019 - nc ##ov and bat ##co ##v rat ##g ##13 , respectively . pang ##olin - co ##v is the lowest common ancestor of 2019 - nc ##ov and rat ##g ##13 . the s ##1 protein of pang ##olin - co ##v is much more closely related to 2019 - nc ##ov than rat ##g ##13 . five key amino - acid residues involved in the interaction with human ace ##2 are completely consistent between pang ##olin - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov but four amino - acid mutations occur in rat ##g ##13 . it indicates pang ##olin - co ##v has similar pathogen ##ic potential to 2019 - nc ##ov , and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
as of early march , 2019 - nc ##ov has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives . 2019 - nc ##ov is a novel form of corona ##virus that causes co ##vid - 19 and has high similarity with sar ##s - co ##v . no approved vaccine yet exists for any form of corona ##virus . here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019 - nc ##ov t - cell and b - cell ep ##ito ##pes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties . these ep ##ito ##pes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutral ##izing antibodies . we identified 405 viral peptide ##s with good antigen presentation scores for both human m ##hc - i and m ##hc - ii all ##eles , and two potential neutral ##izing b - cell ep ##ito ##pes near the 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein receptor binding domain ( 440 - 460 and 49 ##4 - 50 ##6 ) . analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genome ##s from four continents , we identified 96 coding - change mutations . these mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good m ##hc - i presentation scores ( p = 0 . 02 ) . no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain . based on these findings , the spike protein is likely im ##mun ##ogenic and a potential vaccine candidate . we valid ##ated our computational pipeline with sar ##s - co ##v experimental data . significance statement ##the novel corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread . there is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigen ##s which trigger responses from human t - cells and b - cells ( known as ep ##ito ##pes ) . here we identify potential t - cell ep ##ito ##pes through an analysis of human antigen presentation , as well as b - cell ep ##ito ##pes through an analysis of protein structure . we identify a list of top candidates , including an ep ##ito ##pe located on 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein that potentially triggers both t - cell and b - cell responses . analyzing 68 samples , we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation , a potential form of immune eva ##sion . our computational pipeline is valid ##ated with experimental data from sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract ##a novel and highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has caused an outbreak in wu ##han city , hub ##ei province of china since december 2019 , and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world . to better understand the initial step of infection at atomic - level , we determined the crystal structure of the 2019 - nc ##ov spike receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) bound with the cell receptor ace ##2 at 2 . 45 a resolution . the overall ace ##2 - binding mode of the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d is nearly identical to that of the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d , which also utilizes ace ##2 as the cell receptor . structural analysis identified residues in 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d critical for ace ##2 binding , and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d . such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a converge ##nt evolution between 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d for improved binding to ace ##2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineage ##s in the beta ##cor ##ona ##virus genus . the ep ##ito ##pes of two sar ##s - co ##v antibodies targeting the rb ##d are also analyzed with the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d , providing insights into future identification of cross - reactive antibodies .  
summary ##the recent emergence of a novel corona ##virus associated with an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia ( co ##vid - 2019 ) resulted in infections of more than 72 , 000 people and claimed over 1 , 800 lives . corona ##virus spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein trim ##ers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humor ##al immune response . we show here that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s media ##tes entry in ve ##ro ##e ##6 cells and in b ##h ##k cells transient ##ly trans ##fect ##ed with human ace ##2 , establishing ace ##2 as a functional receptor for this novel corona ##virus . we further demonstrate that the receptor - binding domains of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s and sar ##s - co ##v s bind with similar af ##fin ##ities to human ace ##2 , which co ##rre ##lates with the efficient spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 among humans . we found that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein harbor ##s a fur ##in cleavage site at the boundary between the s ##1 / s ##2 subunit ##s , which is processed during bio ##genesis and sets this virus apart from sar ##s - co ##v and other sar ##s - related co ##vs . we determined a cry ##o - electron microscopy structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ec ##to ##dom ##ain trim ##er , demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor - binding domain , and providing a blue ##print for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry . finally , we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v s mu ##rine poly ##cl ##onal sera potent ##ly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s - mediated entry into target cells , thereby indicating that cross - neutral ##izing antibodies targeting conserved s ep ##ito ##pes can be eli ##cite ##d upon va ##cci ##nation .  
abstract ##ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) that is causing the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . like other corona ##virus ##es such as the sar ##s - co ##v , the 2019 - nc ##ov uses the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the surface spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s protein ) to engage ace ##2 . we most recently determined the structure of the full - length human ace ##2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transport ##er b ##0 ##at ##1 . here we report the cry ##o - em structure of the full - length human ace ##2 bound to the rb ##d of the 2019 - nc ##ov at an overall resolution of 2 . 9 a in the presence of b ##0 ##at ##1 . the local resolution at the ace ##2 - rb ##d interface is 3 . 5 a , allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the rb ##d and the receptor . similar to that for the sar ##s - co ##v , the rb ##d of the 2019 - nc ##ov is recognized by the extra ##cellular pep ##ti ##das ##e domain ( pd ) of ace ##2 mainly through polar residues . pair ##wise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different af ##fin ##ities between ace ##2 and the rb ##ds from these two related viruses .  
abstract ##using inc ##ip ##ient lines of the collaborative cross ( cc ) , a mu ##rine genetic reference population , we previously identified a quantitative trait lo ##ci ( q ##tl ) associated with low sar ##s - co ##v ti ##ter . in this study , we integrated sequence information and rna expression of genes within the q ##tl to identify mu ##cin 4 ( mu ##c ##4 ) as a high priority candidate for controlling sar ##s - co ##v ti ##ter in the lung . to test this hypothesis , we infected mu ##c ##4 - / - mice and found that female , but not male , mu ##c ##4 - / - mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with sar ##s - co ##v . female mu ##c ##4 - / - mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology ; however , no change in viral ti ##ters was observed . comparing across viral families , studies with chi ##ku ##ng ##un ##ya virus , a mosquito - borne art ##hra ##l ##gic virus , suggests that mu ##c ##4 ’ s impact on viral pathogen ##esis may be widespread . although not confirming the original ti ##ter q ##tl , our data identifies a role for mu ##c ##4 in the sar ##s - co ##v disease and viral pathogen ##esis . importance ##gi ##ven the recent emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , this work suggest that mu ##c ##4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following sar ##s - co ##v infection . with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak continuing , treatments that mod ##ulate or enhance mu ##c ##4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes . in addition , the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes .  
the recent outbreak of a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( also known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) threatens global health , given serious cause for concern . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a human - to - human pathogen that caused fever , severe respiratory disease and pneumonia ( known as co ##vid - 19 ) . by press time , more than 70 , 000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus broke out 17 years ago . however , it has increased trans ##mis ##sibility as compared with the sar ##s - co ##v , e . g . very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others . it is thus urgent to develop a rapid , accurate and on ##sit ##e diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early in ##fect ##s , treat them on time and control the disease spreading . here we developed an iso ##thermal lamp based method - il ##aco ( iso ##thermal lamp based method for co ##vid - 19 ) to amp ##li ##fy a fragment of the or ##f ##1 ##ab gene using 6 prime ##rs . we assured the species - specific ##ity of il ##aco by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by blast ( including 7 similar corona ##virus ##es , 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal corona ##virus ##es ) . the sensitivity is comparable to ta ##q ##man based q ##pc ##r detection method , detecting synthesized rna equivalent to 10 copies of 2019 - nc ##ov virus . reaction time varied from 15 - 40 minutes , depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples . the accuracy , simplicity and versa ##tility of the new developed method suggests that il ##aco ass ##ays can be convenient ##ly applied with for 2019 - nc ##ov threat control , even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available .  
abstract ##the respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of corona ##virus has been emerging from china and caused more than 1000 death globally since december 2019 . this new virus , called 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) uses the same receptor called ang ##iot ##ens ##in ##con ##vert ##ing enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) to attack humans as the corona ##virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) seventeen years ago . both viruses recognize ace ##2 through the spike proteins ( s - protein ) on their surfaces . it was found that the s - protein from the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) bind stronger to ace ##2 than 2019 - nc ##ov . however , function of a bio - system is often under kinetic , rather than the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic , control . to address this issue , we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ace ##2 and the s - protein from 2019 - nc ##ov , so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of s - protein from sar ##s - co ##v by a multi ##sca ##le simulation method . our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than sar ##s , which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently . we further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its inter ##play with the innate immune system . interesting ##ly , we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer inc ##uba ##tion period , while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body . our computational study therefore provides , from the molecular level , one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than sar ##s .  
a respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in china , since its outbreak in wu ##han city , hub ##ei province in december 2019 . the illness was caused by a novel corona ##virus , named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . clinical manifestation ##s related to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ranged from no sy ##mpt ##om to fatal pneumonia . world health organization ( who ) named the diseases associated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection as co ##vid - 19 . real time rt - pc ##r is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection . however , the accuracy of real time rt - pc ##r depends on many factors , including sampling location and of methods , quality of rna extraction and training of operators etc . variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection . we developed a peptide - based lu ##mine ##scent im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y to detect i ##gg and i ##gm . cut - off value of this ass ##ay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogen ##s than sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to evaluate the performance of this ass ##ay , we detected i ##gg and i ##gm in the 276 sera from confirmed patients . the positive rate of i ##gg and i ##gm were 71 . 4 % ( 197 / 276 ) and 57 . 2 % ( 158 / 276 ) respectively . by combining with real time rt - pc ##r detection , this ass ##ay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , also previously known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) , originated in wu ##han seafood and animal market , china . since december 2019 , more than 69 , 000 cases of co ##vid - 19 have been confirmed in china and quickly spreads to other counties . currently , researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for co ##vid - 19 . the neutral ##izing antibody , which binds to viral caps ##id in a manner that inhibit ##s cellular entry of virus and un ##coat ##ing of the genome , is the specific defense against viral invaders . in this study , we investigate to identify neutral ##izing antibodies that can bind to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sip ##ke ( s ) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral s protein and a host receptor by bio ##in ##form ##atic methods . the sequence analysis of s protein showed two major differences in the rb ##d region of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein compared to sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v related bat viruses ( bt ##sar ##s - co ##v ) . the insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ace ##2 receptor . ep ##ito ##pe analysis of neutral ##izing antibodies revealed that sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies used conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes , whereas mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies used a common linear ep ##ito ##pe region , which contributes to form the β - sheet structure in mer ##s - co ##v s protein and deleted in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein . to identify effective neutral ##izing antibodies for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the binding af ##fin ##ities of neutral ##izing antibodies with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein were predicted and compared by antibody - antigen docking simulation . the result showed that cr ##30 ##22 neutral ##izing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein than sar ##s - co ##v s protein . we also found that f ##26 ##g ##19 and d ##12 mouse antibodies could bind to sar ##s - co ##v s protein with high affinity . our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis , therapeutic antibody , and the vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
we plotted daily data on the frequencies of key ##words related to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) from we ##cha ##t , a chinese social media . using ' fei ##dian ' , chinese abbreviation for sar ##s , may detect the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak in 2019 two weeks earlier . we ##cha ##t offered a new approach to early detect disease outbreak ##s .  
abstract ##the ongoing outbreak of a new corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans . 2019 - nc ##ov rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries , thus , pose a serious threat to public health . recent studies show that spike ( s ) proteins of 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v may use the same host cell receptor called ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) for entering into host cells . the affinity between ace ##2 and 2019 - nc ##ov s is much higher than ace ##2 binding to sar ##s - co ##v s protein , explaining that why 2019 - nc ##ov seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human . here , we reported that ace ##2 can be significantly up ##re ##gul ##ated after infection of various viruses including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . basin ##g on findings here , we propose that corona ##virus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread , thus drugs targeting ace ##2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is newly emerging human infectious diseases , which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , also previously known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) . within two months of the outbreak , more than 80 , 000 cases of co ##vid - 19 have been confirmed worldwide . since the human to human transmission occurred easily and the human infection is rapidly increasing , the sensitive and early diagnosis is essential to prevent the global outbreak . recently , world health organization ( who ) announced various prime ##r and probe sets for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 previously developed in china , germany , hong kong , japan , thailand , and usa . in this study , we compared the ability to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna among the seven prime ##r - probe sets for n gene and the three prime ##r - probe sets for or ##f ##1 gene . the result of the comparative analysis represented that the ‘ 2019 - nc ##ov _ n ##2 , n ##3 ’ of usa and the ‘ or ##f ##1 ##ab ’ of china are the most sensitive prime ##r - probe sets for n and or ##f ##1 genes , respectively . therefore , the appropriate combination from or ##f ##1 ##ab ( china ) , 2019 - nc ##ov _ n ##2 , n ##3 ( usa ) , and ni ##id _ 2019 - nc ##ov _ n ( japan ) sets should be selected for the sensitive and reliable laboratory confirmation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the outbreak of the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries . the sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing the ##ra ##pies for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . therefore , vaccines and anti ##vira ##l medicines are in desperate need . this study took immune - inform ##atics approaches to identify b - and t - cell ep ##ito ##pes for surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , followed by est ##imating their antigen ##ici ##ty and interactions with the human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) all ##eles . we identified four b cell ep ##ito ##pes , two m ##hc class - i and nine m ##hc class - ii binding t - cell ep ##ito ##pes , which showed highly antigen ##ic features . all ##er ##genic ##ity , toxicity and ph ##ys ##io ##chemical properties analysis confirmed the specific ##ity and select ##ivity of ep ##ito ##pes . the stability and safety of ep ##ito ##pes were confirmed by digest ##ion analysis . no mutations were observed in all the selected b - and t - cell ep ##ito ##pes across all isolate ##s from different locations worldwide . ep ##ito ##pes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development .  
abstract ##in 2015 , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) reached the republic of korea through nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission and was the largest epidemic outside of the arabian peninsula . to date , despite various strategies to identify co ##v interventions , only limited therapeutic options are available . to address these un ##met medical needs , we used a south korean mer ##s - co ##v clinical isolate and screened 5 , 406 compounds , including united states food and drug administration ( fda ) - approved drugs and bio ##active molecules , for their activity against the isolate . the primary ass ##ay confirmed 221 hits by dose - response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index ( ti ) greater than 6 . time - of - addition studies with 12 fda - approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutic ##s act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle , respectively . among the drugs were e . g . , three card ##iot ##onic agents ( ou ##aba ##in , digit ##ox ##in , dig ##ox ##in ) with a ti greater than 100 , an anti - malaria drug ( at ##ova ##qu ##one ; ti > 34 ) , an in ##hala ##ble co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid ( ci ##cles ##oni ##de ; ti > 6 ) , etc . together , our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating mer ##s - co ##v infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of corona ##virus - related illnesses , including the currently emerging corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) outbreak .  
purpose : the aim of this study was to identify whether sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected in o ##cular surface . methods : cross - sectional study of patients presenting for who received a co ##vid - 19 diagnosis , from december 30 , 2019 to february 7 , 2020 , at tong ##ji hospital , tong ##ji medical college , hua ##zh ##ong university of science and technology . demographics , temperature was recorded , blood routine test ( rt ) , chest computed tom ##ography ( ct ) were took intermittent ##ly , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 real - time reverse - transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase - chain - reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ay were arranged for the nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l sw ##ab samples . results : a total of 102 patients ( 48 male [ 50 % ] and 54 female [ 50 % ] ) with clinical symptoms , rt , and chest computed tom ##ography ( ct ) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of co ##vid - 19 . patients had a mean [ sd ] ge ##station ##al age of 57 . 63 [ 14 . 90 ] years . of a total of 102 patients identified , 72 patients ( 36 men [ 50 % ] and 36 women [ 50 % ] ; mean [ sd ] age , 58 . 68 [ 14 . 81 ] years ) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r ass ##ay . only two patients ( 2 . 78 % ) with con ##jun ##ct ##iv ##itis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed co ##vid - 19 . however , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna fragments was found in o ##cular discharge ##s by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r only in one patient with con ##jun ##ct ##iv ##itis . conclusions : although we suspect the incidence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection through the o ##cular surface is extremely low , the nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route . the in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt diagnostic method and the sampling time la ##g may contribute to the lower positive rate of con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l sw ##ab samples of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . therefore , to lower the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection , the protective go ##ggles should be wore in all the health care workers .  
background : as of march 2 , 2020 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has infected more than 80 ##17 ##4 people and caused 291 ##5 deaths in china . this virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide . thus , in order to effectively block its transmission , it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . methods : from january 28 to february 18 , 2020 , 35 female patients diagnosed with co ##vid - 19 in tong ##ji hospital were included in this descriptive study . the g ##yne ##col ##og ##ic history , clinical characteristics , laboratory findings and chest computed tom ##ography ( ct ) of all patients were recorded in detail . to examine whether there is sexual transmission through va ##ginal from female to her partner , we employed real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction testing ( rt - pc ##r ) to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in va ##ginal environment ( including va ##ginal discharge , cervical or va ##ginal residual ex ##folia ##ted cells ) and anal sw ##ab samples , and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients . findings : the age range of the 35 patients with co ##vid - 19 was 37 - 88 years . over 50 % patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 had chronic diseases . we tested the va ##ginal environment and anal sw ##ab ##s from the 35 female patients with co ##vid - 19 and found that only an anal sw ##ab sample from one patient was positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . all the samples from va ##ginal environment were negative for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the infection rate of the patients ' sexual partner was 42 . 9 % . additionally , two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection inc ##uba ##tion period , while one patient ' s partner was un ##in ##fect ##ed and the other patient ' s partner was diagnosed with co ##vid - 19 ( after the diagnosis of the female patient ) . conclusion : no positive rt - pc ##r result was found in the va ##ginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ace ##2 expression , which is the receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in the va ##gina and ce ##r ##vi ##x tissues ( human protein atlas ) . the results from this study show no evidence of transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 through va ##ginal sex from female to her partner . however , the risk of infection of non va ##ginal sex and other intimate contacts during va ##ginal sex should not be ignored .  
abstract ##an outbreak of new sar ##s - like viral in wu ##han , china has been named 2019 - nc ##ov . the current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious , and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug . in previous studies , it was found that the conform ##ation change in ct ##d ##1 was the region where sar ##s - co ##v bound to human ace ##2 . although there are mutations of the 2019 - nc ##ov , the binding energy of ace ##2 remains high . the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of 2019 - nc ##ov was coincide ##nt with the ct ##d ##1 region of the s - protein by comparing the i - ta ##sser prediction model with the actual sar ##s model , which suggests that 2019 - nc ##ov may bind to the ace ##2 receptor through conform ##ation ##al changes . furthermore , site prediction on the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of 2019 - nc ##ov suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019 - nc ##ov .  
abstract ##the emergence and outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 , has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast , sensitive , and specific tools to sur ##ve ##il circulating viruses . here we provide ass ##ay designs and experimental resources , for use with crisp ##r - based nuclei ##c acid detection , that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance . we provide ass ##ay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies , including : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , phylogenetic ##ally - related viruses , and viruses with similar clinical presentation . the designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nuclei ##c acid detection ass ##ays that are comprehensive across gen ##omic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific . of our design set , we experimental ##ly screened 4 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 designs with a crisp ##r - cas ##13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest - performing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ass ##ay . we demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this ass ##ay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection . moreover , our provided protocol can be extended for testing the other 66 provided designs . ass ##ay designs are available at https : / / adapt . sa ##bet ##ila ##b . org / .  
abstract ##the corona ##virus outbreak took place in december 2019 and continues to spread worldwide . in the absence of an effective vaccine , inhibitor rep ##ur ##po ##sing may seem a fruit ##ful attempt . here , we compared mp ##ros from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . despite a high level of sequence similarity , the binding sites of anal ##yse ##d proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that rep ##ur ##po ##sing sar ##s drugs for co ##vid - 19 may be futile . furthermore , the analysis of the pockets ’ conform ##ation ##al changes during the simulation time indicates their flexibility , which dash ##es hopes for rapid and reliable drug design . conversely , structural stability of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mp ##ro with respect to mutations of the binding cavity and adjacent flexible loops indicates that the protein ’ s mu ##ta ##bility will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small - molecule inhibitors . however , few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchor ##ing residues for mp ##ro inhibitor design .  
abstract ##the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is a member of the family corona ##vir ##idae and contains a single - stranded rna genome with positive - polar ##ity . to reveal the evolution mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome , we performed comprehensive gen ##omic analysis with newly sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains and 20 closely related corona ##virus strains . among 98 nu ##cle ##otide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains , 58 of them caused amino acid change , indicating a result of neutral evolution . however , the ratio of nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s to amino acid substitution ##s of spike gene ( 9 . 07 ) between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 wi ##v ##0 ##4 and bat - sar ##sr - co ##v rat ##g ##13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other corona ##virus ##es ( range 1 . 29 - 4 . 81 ) . the elevated synonymous mutations between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and rat ##g ##13 , suggesting they underwent stronger pu ##ri ##fying selection . moreover , their nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s are enriched with t : c transition , which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by dea ##ct ##ivity of rna 3 ’ - to - 5 ’ ex ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se ( ex ##on ) . the cod ##on usage was similar between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other strains in beta - corona ##virus lineage b , suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern . in comparison of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 wi ##v ##0 ##4 with bat - sar ##sr - co ##v rat ##g ##13 , the ratios of non - synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ( d ##n / ds ) was the lowest among all performed comparisons , rec ##on ##firm ##ing the evolution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 under string ##ent selective pressure . moreover , some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection . therefore , our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogen ##ici ##ty and its adaptation with hosts .  
the ongoing outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) started in the end of 2019 in china has triggered a global public health crisis . previous studies have shown that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect ##s cells by binding ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which is the same as sar ##s - co ##v . the expression and distribution of ace ##2 in the pan ##cre ##as are unknown . at the same time , the injury of pan ##cre ##as after sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection has not been concerned . here , we collected public data ##set ##s ( bulk rna - se ##q and single - cell rna - se ##q ) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ace ##2 in pan ##cre ##as ( in both ex ##oc ##rine glands and isle ##ts ) . and further , clinical data including mild and severe patients with co ##vid - 19 demonstrated there existed mild pan ##cre ##ati ##tis . in the 67 severe cases , 11 patients ( 16 . 41 % ) showed elevated levels of both amy ##lase and lip ##ase , and 5 patients ( 7 . 46 % ) showed imaging alterations . only one patient ( 1 . 85 % ) showed elevated levels of both amy ##lase and lip ##ase in 54 mild cases , without imaging changes . our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pan ##cre ##atic injury in patients with co ##vid - 19 . this suggests that pan ##cre ##ati ##tis after sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work .  
abstract ##in this work , we use a within - host viral dynamic model to describe the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 kinetic ##s in host . chest radio ##graph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model . our result shows that the basic reproductive number of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in host growth is around 3 . 79 . using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of mer ##s virus is 8 . 16 which is higher than sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the prc ##c method is used to analyze the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model .

abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has received global attention due to the recent outbreak in china . in this work , we report a crisp ##r - cas ##12 based diagnostic tool to detect synthetic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna sequences in a proof - of - principle evaluation . the test proved to be sensitive , rapid , and potentially portable . these key traits of the crisp ##r method are critical for virus detection in regions that lack resources to use the currently available methods .  
corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a recently emerged life - threatening disease caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . real - time fluorescent pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) is the clinical standard for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detection . to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 early and control the disease spreading on time , a faster and more convenient method for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detecting , rt - lamp method ( reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ) was developed . rna reverse transcription and nuclei ##c acid amp ##li ##fication were performed in one step at 63 [UNK] iso ##thermal conditions , and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes . or ##f ##1 ##ab gene , e gene and n gene were detected at the same time . or ##f ##1 ##ab gene was very specific and n gene was very sensitivity , so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specific ##ity for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the sensitivity of rt - lamp ass ##ay is similar to rt - pc ##r , and specific ##ity was 99 % as detecting 208 clinical specimens . the rt - lamp ass ##ay reported here has the advantages of rapid amp ##li ##fication , simple operation , and easy detection , which is useful for the rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .

there is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 will un ##fold in coming years . these dynamics will depend on seasonal ##ity , the duration of immunity , and the strength of cross - immunity to / from the other human corona ##virus ##es . using data from the united states , we measured how these factors affect transmission of human beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 . we then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 through the year 202 ##5 . we project that rec ##urrent winter ##time outbreak ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 will probably occur after an initial pan ##de ##mic wave . we sum ##mar ##ize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them , most importantly longitudinal ser ##ological studies to determine the duration of immunity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - related corona ##virus ##es ( e . g . , 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v ) are phylogenetic ##ally distant ##ly related , but both are capable of in ##fect ##ing human hosts via the same receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , and cause similar clinical and path ##ological features , suggesting their ph ##eno ##typic convergence . yet , the molecular basis that under ##lies their ph ##eno ##typic convergence remains unknown . here , we used a recently developed molecular ph ##yl ##oe ##col ##ogical approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their ph ##eno ##typic convergence . our genome - level analyses show that the spike protein , which is responsible for receptor binding , has undergone significant darwin ##ian selection along the branches related to 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v . further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary converge ##nt amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike protein between co ##vid - 19 and sar ##s - related co ##v clade ##s , leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rb ##d protein sequences . in addition to the spike protein , we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein , or ##f ##3 ##a , suggesting their possible co - evolutionary convergence . our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between co ##vid - 19 and sar ##s - related co ##v , possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors . finally , it should be noted that many observed bat sar ##s - like co ##vs that have an evolutionary converge ##nt rb ##d sequence with 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v may be pre - adapted to human host receptor ace ##2 , and hence would be potential new corona ##virus sources to in ##fect humans in the future .  
abstract ##the spread of the co ##vid - 19 caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in december 2019 . the publishing of the first sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , evolution , and interaction with the host . protein - protein binding ass ##ays have confirmed that ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invade ##s the host cell . in the present work , we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) from different corona ##virus isolate ##s with host ace ##2 protein . we used homo ##logy - based protein - protein docking , binding energy estimation , and decomposition , aiming to predict both qu ##ali ##tative and quantitative aspects of the interaction . using in si ##lic ##o structural modelling , we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein rb ##d might be acquired by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation . we also highlighted the relevance of q ##49 ##3 and p ##49 ##9 amino acid residues of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d for binding to ha ##ce ##2 and maintaining the stability of the interface . finally , we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ace ##2 , on the complex formation with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d . we found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the current outbreak of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) by a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has aroused great public health concern . corona ##virus has a history of causing epidemic ##s in human and animals . in 2017 an outbreak in pig ##lets by a novel corona ##virus was emerged designated as sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus ) as severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) having a broad species tr ##op ##ism . in addition to human cells , it can also in ##fect cell lines from diverse species . corona ##virus host range is determined by its spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) . given the importance of s protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses , here we report the cry ##o - em structure of the sad ##s - co ##v s in the pre ##fusion conform ##ation at a resolution of 3 . 55 a . our study reveals that sad ##s - co ##v s structure takes an intra - subunit qu ##ater ##nary packing mode where the nt ##d and ct ##d from the same subunit pack together by facing each other . the comparison of nt ##d and ct ##d with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the sad ##s - co ##v s . moreover , sad ##s - co ##v s has several characteristic structural features , such as more compact architecture of s trim ##er , and mask ##ing of ep ##ito ##pes by g ##ly ##can shielding , which may facilitate viral immune eva ##sion . these data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of sad ##s - co ##v s and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity , which will facilitate to vaccine development .  
abstracts ##in ##ce december 2019 , corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) emerged in wu ##han , central china and rapidly spread throughout china . up to march 3 , 2020 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has infected more than 89 , 000 people in china and other 66 countries across six continents . in this study , we used 10 new sequence ##d genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and combined 136 genome ##s from gi ##sai ##d database to investigate the genetic variation and population demo ##graphy through different analysis approaches ( e . g . network , e ##bs ##p , mis ##mat ##ch , and neutrality tests ) . the results showed that 80 ha ##pl ##otype ##s had 183 substitution sites , including 27 par ##si ##mony - inform ##ative and 156 singleton ##s . sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus . phylogenetic analysis showed that the view , pang ##olin acted as an intermediate host , may be controversial . the network indicated that , in the original ha ##pl ##otype ( h ##14 ) , one patient sample lived near the hua ##nan seafood market ( approximate 2 km ) , indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market . however , based on this clue , we cannot accurately concluded that whether this market was the origin center of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . additionally , 16 genome ##s , collected from this market , assigned to 10 ha ##pl ##otype ##s , indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term and then leading to the outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wu ##han and other areas . the e ##bs ##p results showed that the first estimated expansion date of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 began from 7 december 2019 , which may indicated that the transmission could have begun from person to person in mid to late november .  
abstract ##a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of an emerge ##nt severe respiratory disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis . by using gen ##omic , sequence , structural and evolutionary analysis , we show that alpha - and beta - co ##vs possess several novel families of im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##g ) domain proteins , including or ##f ##8 and or ##f ##7 ##a from sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es and two protein groups from certain alpha - co ##vs . among them , or ##f ##8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving , possessing a unique insert and a hyper ##var ##iable position among sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s in its predicted ligand - binding groove . we also uncover many i ##g proteins from several meta ##zo ##an viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of co ##v i ##g domain proteins . hence , we propose that deployment of i ##g domain proteins is a widely - used strategy by viruses , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or ##f ##8 is a potential pathogen ##ici ##ty factor which evolve ##s rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts .

abstract ##zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are significant threats to global health , as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) 1 . host immune responses to co ##v are complex and regulated in part through anti ##vira ##l inter ##fer ##ons . however , the inter ##fer ##on - stimulated gene products that inhibit co ##v are not well characterized ##2 . here , we show that inter ##fer ##on - ind ##ucible l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte antigen 6 complex , locus e ( l ##y ##6 ##e ) potent ##ly restrict ##s cellular infection by multiple co ##vs , including sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . me ##chan ##istic studies revealed that l ##y ##6 ##e inhibit ##s co ##v entry into cells by interfering with spike protein - mediated membrane fusion . importantly , mice lacking l ##y ##6 ##e in hem ##ato ##po ##ie ##tic cells were highly susceptible to mu ##rine co ##v infection . ex ##ace ##rba ##ted viral pathogen ##esis in l ##y ##6 ##e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of he ##pati ##c and sp ##len ##ic immune cells and reduction in global anti ##vira ##l gene pathways . accordingly , we found that l ##y ##6 ##e directly protects primary b cells and den ##dr ##itic cells from mu ##rine co ##v infection . our results demonstrate that l ##y ##6 ##e is a critical anti ##vira ##l immune effect ##or that controls co ##v infection and pathogen ##esis . these findings advance our understanding of immune - mediated control of co ##v in vitro and in vivo , knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging co ##v .  
background the outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) poses a challenge for public health laboratories . we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of ser ##ological ass ##ay for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . methods a newly - developed elisa ass ##ay for i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies against n protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were used to screen the serum ##s of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection from february 6 to february 14 , 2020 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected by real time rt - pc ##r on ph ##ary ##nge ##al sw ##ab specimens . findings of the 238 patients , 194 ( 81 . 5 % ) were detected to be antibody ( i ##gm and / or i ##gg ) positive , which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral rna ( 64 . 3 % ) . there was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients ( 83 . 0 % , 127 / 153 ) and the suspected patients ( 78 . 8 % , 67 / 85 ) whose nuclei ##c acid tests were negative . after the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected , the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms , and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed . after 10 days , the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80 % from less than 50 % . on the contrary , the positive rates of viral rna kept above 60 % in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms , and then rapidly decreased . in addition , half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6 - 10 days were detected to be antibody positive . interpretation the suspected patients were most likely infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms , nuclei ##c acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection . the combination of ser ##ological ass ##ay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy . after that , the diagnosis for viral infection should be major ##ly dependent on ser ##ological ass ##ay . key ##words . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; diagnosis ; ser ##ological ass ##ay ; nuclei ##c acid test 
an outbreak of novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( formerly named 2019 - nc ##ov ) , began in wu ##han , china in december 2019 and the co ##vid - 19 disease associated with infection has since spread rapidly to multiple countries . here we report the development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detect ##r , a rapid ( ~ 30 min ) , low - cost , and accurate crisp ##r - cas ##12 based lateral flow ass ##ay for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we valid ##ated this method using con ##tri ##ved reference samples and clinical samples from infected us patients and demonstrated comparable performance to the us cdc sar ##s - co ##v - 2 real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay .  
abstract ##the outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) in china caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths . it is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutic ##s yet . viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein is a potential anti ##vira ##l drug target , serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle . however , the structural information of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein is yet to be clear . here ##in , we have determined the 2 . 7 a crystal structure of the n - terminal rna binding domain of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . although overall structure is similar with other reported corona ##virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein n - terminal domain , the surface electro ##static potential characteristics between them are distinct . further comparison with mild virus type hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential rna binding pocket alongside the β - sheet core . complement ##ed by in vitro binding studies , our data provide several atomic resolution features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein n - terminal domain , guiding the design of novel anti ##vira ##l agents specific targeting to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the emergence of a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , at the end of 2019 has resulted in widespread human infections across the globe . while genetically distinct from sar ##s - co ##v , the et ##iol ##ogical agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 , both corona ##virus ##es exhibit receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , for virus entry . therefore , it will be important to test the cross - react ##ivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v in order to aid research on the newly emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we show that an im ##mun ##ogenic domain in the s ##2 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v s is highly conserved in multiple strains of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . consistently , four mu ##rine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) raised against this im ##mun ##ogenic sar ##s - co ##v fragment were able to recognise the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 expressed in a mammalian cell line . importantly , one of them ( mab 1a ##9 ) was demonstrated to detect s in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected cells . to our knowledge , this is the first study showing that mab ##s targeting the s ##2 domain of sar ##s - co ##v can cross - react with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the s ##2 subunit . these cross - reactive mab ##s may serve as tools useful for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic ass ##ays for its associated corona ##virus disease co ##vid - 19 .  
the world health organization declared that co ##vid - 19 outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 became mandatory to identify , isolate and provide opt ##imi ##zed care for patients early . rt - q ##pc ##r testing of respiratory secret ##ions is routinely used to detect ca ##usa ##tive viruses in acute respiratory infection . rt - q ##pc ##r in - house protocols to detect the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have been described . validation ##s of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for co ##vid - 19 , especially if executed in a high through ##put format . here , we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specific ##ity of two interim rt - q ##pc ##r protocols for the qu ##ali ##tative detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 executed in a fully automated platform . under our conditions , the n ##1 and rd ##rp ( modified ) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their rna targets . e ass ##ay , in its original concentration , was considered a tertiary confirm ##atory ass ##ay . taken together , n ##1 , rd ##rp ( opt ##imi ##zed ) and e presented appropriated analytical sen ##sibility and specific ##ity in our automated rt - q ##pc ##r work ##flow for co ##vid - 19 virus , e being at least 4 - fold less sensitive than the others . this study highlights the importance of local validation of in - house ass ##ays before its availability to the population . the use of the synthetic rt - q ##pc ##r target to investigate novel ass ##ays diagnostic parameters in automated work ##flow ##s is a quick , simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats . the proposed ass ##ay detected the first sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in brazilian central - west .  
background nuclei ##c acid test and antibody ass ##ay have been employed in the diagnosis for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed . theoretically , viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and pre ##cede ##s antibody appearance within the infected population . there is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis . methods we included a co ##hort of 239 participants with suspected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection from 7 centers for the study . we measured nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab samples in parallel with the nuclei ##c acid test . nuclei ##c acid test was taken as the reference standard , and statistical evaluation was taken in blind . we detected nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in 20 urine samples in another center , employing nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab nuclei ##c acid test as reference standard . results we developed a flu ##orescence im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic ass ##ay for detecting nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab sample and urine within 10 minutes . 100 % of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein positive and negative participants accord with nuclei ##c acid test for same samples . further , earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method . in an additional preliminary study , we detected nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in urine in 73 . 6 % of diagnosed co ##vid - 19 patients . conclusions those findings indicate that nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ass ##ay is an accurate , rapid , early and simple method for diagnosis of co ##vid - 19 . appearance of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in urine coincide ##s our finding of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value .  
abstract ##in december 2019 , the first cases of a novel corona ##virus infection were diagnosed in wu ##han , china . due to international travel and human - to - human transmission , the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of china . currently , there is no effective anti ##vira ##l treatment for co ##vid - 19 , therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mp ##ro pro ##tea ##se constitutes one of the most attractive anti ##vira ##l drug targets . to address this emerging problem , we have synthesized a comb ##inator ##ial library of flu ##oro ##genic substrates with g ##lu ##tam ##ine in the p ##1 position . we used it to determine the substrate preferences of the sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##tea ##ses , using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids . the results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as anti ##vira ##l agents or diagnostic tests .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 , a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world . while genetically distinct from the original sar ##s - co ##v , both group 2 ##b co ##vs share similar genome organization and origins to corona ##virus ##es harbor ##ed in bats . importantly , initial guidance has used insights from sar ##s - co ##v infection to inform treatment and public health strategies . in this report , we evaluate type - i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n - i ) sensitivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 relative to the original sar ##s - co ##v . our results indicate that while sar ##s - co ##v - 2 maintains similar viral replication kinetic ##s to sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro cell , the novel co ##v is much more sensitive to if ##n - i pre ##tre ##at ##ment . examining transcription ##al factor activation and inter ##fer ##on stimulated gene ( is ##g ) induction , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the context of type i if ##n induce ##s ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of stat ##1 and increased is ##g proteins . in contrast , the original sar ##s - co ##v has no evidence for stat ##1 ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation or is ##g protein increases even in the presence of type i if ##n pre ##tre ##at ##ment . finally , we examined homo ##logy between sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in viral proteins shown to be inter ##fer ##on antagonist . the absence of open reading frame ( or ##f ) 3 ##b and significant changes to or ##f ##6 suggest the two key if ##n antagonist ##s may not maintain equivalent function in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . together , the results identify key differences in su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to the if ##n - i response between sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . that could help inform disease progression , treatment options , and animal model development . importance ##with the ongoing outbreak of co ##vid - 19 disease , differences between the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the original sar ##s - co ##v could be leverage ##d to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options . in addition , these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mod ##ulates the type i if ##n response early during infection . article summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has similar replication kinetic ##s to sar ##s - co ##v , but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type i inter ##fer ##on treatment .  
abstract ##back ##ground ##the ongoing outbreak of co ##vid - 19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern . while the transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear , the aero ##sol transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been little studied . methods ##thi ##rt ##y - five aero ##sol samples of three different types ( total suspended particle , size segregated and deposition aero ##sol ) were collected in patient areas ( pa ##a ) and medical staff areas ( ms ##a ) of ren ##min hospital of wu ##han university ( ren ##min ) and wu ##chang fang ##can ##g field hospital ( fang ##can ##g ) , and public areas ( pu ##a ) in wu ##han , china during co ##vid - 19 outbreak . a robust drop ##let digital polymer ##ase chain reaction ( dd ##pc ##r ) method was employed to quan ##ti ##tate the viral sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna genome and determine aero ##sol rna concentration . results ##the ic ##u , cc ##u and general patient rooms inside ren ##min , patient hall inside fang ##can ##g had und ##ete ##ctable or low airborne sar ##s - co ##v - 2 concentration but deposition samples inside ic ##u and air sample in fang ##can ##g patient toilet tested positive . the airborne sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in fang ##can ##g ms ##a had bi ##mo ##dal distribution with higher concentration than those in ren ##min during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous san ##iti ##zation implemented . pu ##a had und ##ete ##ctable airborne sar ##s - co ##v - 2 concentration but obviously increased with acc ##um ##ulating crowd flow . conclusions ##room ventilation , open space , proper use and di ##sin ##fect ##ion of toilet can effectively limit aero ##sol transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . gathering of crowds with as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers is a potential source of airborne sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the virus aero ##sol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent res ##us ##pen ##sion is a potential transmission pathway and effective san ##iti ##zation is critical in mini ##mi ##zing aero ##sol transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
introduction : more than 93 , 000 cases of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) have been reported worldwide . we describe the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical course , and vi ##rol ##og ##ic characteristics of the first 12 u . s . patients with co ##vid - 19 . methods : we collected demographic , exposure , and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by cdc during january 20 - february 5 , 2020 to have co ##vid - 19 . respiratory , stool , serum , and urine specimens were submitted for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rr ##t - pc ##r testing , virus culture , and whole genome sequencing . results : among the 12 patients , median age was 53 years ( range : 21 - 68 ) ; 8 were male , 10 had traveled to china , and two were contacts of patients in this series . commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever ( n = 7 ) and cough ( n = 8 ) . seven patients were hospitalized with radio ##graphic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worse ##ning during the second week of illness . three were treated with the investigation ##al anti ##vira ##l re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir . all patients had sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna detected in respiratory specimens , typically for 2 - 3 weeks after illness onset , with lowest rr ##t - pc ##r ct values often detected in the first week . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected after reported sy ##mpt ##om resolution in seven patients . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was culture ##d from respiratory specimens , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected in stool from 7 / 10 patients . conclusions : in 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna and viable virus were detected early , and prolonged rna detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long . hospitalized patients showed signs of worse ##ning in the second week after illness onset .  
a novel human corona ##virus , now named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , referred to as hc ##ov - 19 here ) that emerged in wu ##han , china in late 2019 is now causing a pan ##de ##mic . here , we analyze the aero ##sol and surface stability of hc ##ov - 19 and compare it with sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , the most closely related human corona ##virus . 2 we evaluated the stability of hc ##ov - 19 and sar ##s - co ##v - 1 in aero ##sol ##s and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a bay ##esian regression model 
abstract ##the recent outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in wu ##han , china has posed a serious threat to global public health . to develop specific anti - corona ##virus therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s , the molecular mechanism that under ##lies viral infection must first be confirmed . therefore , we here ##in used a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike ( s ) protein - mediated cell - cell fusion ass ##ay and found that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of sar ##s - co ##v . we solved the x - ray crystal structure of six - he ##lica ##l bundle ( 6 - h ##b ) core of the hr ##1 and hr ##2 domains in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein s ##2 subunit , revealing that several mu ##tated amino acid residues in the hr ##1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with hr ##2 domain . we previously developed a pan - corona ##virus fusion inhibitor , ek ##1 , which targeted hr ##1 domain and could inhibit infection by diver ##gent human corona ##virus ##es tested , including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . we then generated a series of lip ##ope ##pt ##ides and found that the ek ##1 ##c ##4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein - mediated membrane fusion and pseudo ##virus infection with ic ##50 ##s of 1 . 3 and 15 . 8 nm , about 241 - and 149 - fold more potent than that of ek ##1 peptide , respectively . ek ##1 ##c ##4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human corona ##virus pseudo ##virus ##es tested , including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , as well as sar ##sr - co ##vs , potent ##ly inhibit ##ing replication of 4 live human corona ##virus ##es , including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . intra ##nas ##al application of ek ##1 ##c ##4 before or after challenge with hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 protected mice from infection , suggesting that ek ##1 ##c ##4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and emerging sar ##sr - co ##vs .  
we found , in our 78 ##8 confirmed co ##vid - 19 patients , the decreased rate of severe / critical type , increased liver / kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid po ##sit ##ivity during virus dissemination , when compared with wu ##han . to investigate the under ##lining mechanism , we isolated one strain of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( z ##j ##01 ) in mild co ##vid - 19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment . further phylogenetic analysis and rs ##cu heat map results suggested that z ##j ##01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide ( c / t type ) based on the base ( c or t ) at positions 88 ##24 and 282 ##47 . z ##j ##01 were both t at these two sites , becoming the only tt type currently identified in the world . the prediction of fur ##in cleavage site ( fc ##s ) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that fc ##s may be an important site of corona ##virus evolution . z ##j ##01 had mutations near fc ##s ( f1 - 2 ) , which caused changes in the structure and the electro ##static distribution of the s protein surface , further affecting the binding capacity of fur ##in . single cell sequencing and ace ##2 - fur ##in co - expression results confirmed that fur ##in level was higher in the whole body , especially in glands , liver , kidney and colon while fc ##s may help sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect these organs . the evolutionary pattern of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 towards fc ##s formation may result in its clinical sy ##mpt ##om becoming closer to hk ##u - 1 and o ##c ##43 ( the source of fc ##s sequence - pr ##ra ) caused influenza , further showing potential in different ##iating into mild co ##vid - 19 sub ##type ##s .  
abstract ##the co ##vid - 19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4 , 000 deaths within 10 weeks . we compare the interaction between the human ace ##2 receptor and the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein with that of other pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es using molecular dynamics simulations . sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 recognize ace ##2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ace ##2 and a different network of residue - residue contacts . sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have comparable binding af ##fin ##ities achieved by balancing energetic ##s and dynamics . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 – ace ##2 complex contains a higher number of contacts , a larger interface area , and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to sar ##s - co ##v . these findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration ex ##erted by corona ##virus ##es toward host recognition . we post ##ulate that the versa ##tility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies . one sentence summary ##mo ##le ##cular dynamics simulations reveal a temporal dimension of corona ##virus ##es interactions with the host receptor .  
abstract ##the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) causing co ##vid - 19 is a major burden for health care systems worldwide . it is important to address if the current infection control instructions based on active ingredients are sufficient . we therefore determined the vi ##ru ##ci ##dal activity of two alcohol - based hand rub solutions for hand di ##sin ##fect ##ion recommended by the world health organization ( who ) , as well as commercially available alcohol ##s . efficient sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ina ##ct ##ivation was demonstrated for all tested alcohol - based di ##sin ##fect ##ants . these findings show the successful ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for the first time and provide confidence in its use for the control of co ##vid - 19 . importance ##the current co ##vid - 19 outbreak puts a huge burden on the world ’ s health care systems . without effective therapeutic ##s or vaccines being available , effective hygiene measure are of utmost importance to prevent viral spreading . it is therefore crucial to evaluate current infection control strategies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we show the ina ##ct ##ivation of the novel corona ##virus for the first time and end ##ors ##e the importance of di ##sin ##fect ##ant - based hand hygiene to reduce sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission .

abstract ##the global spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutic ##s for the treatment of co ##vid - 19 . we developed a data - driven drug rep ##osition ##ing framework , which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large - scale knowledge graph , literature and transcript ##ome data to discover the potential drug candidates against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the retrospective study using the past sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific corona ##virus . our in si ##lic ##o screening followed by wet - lab validation indicated that a poly - ad ##p - rib ##ose polymer ##ase 1 ( par ##p ##1 ) inhibitor , cv ##l ##21 ##8 , currently in phase i clinical trial , may be rep ##ur ##posed to treat co ##vid - 19 . our in vitro ass ##ays revealed that cv ##l ##21 ##8 can exhibit effective inhibitor ##y activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication without obvious cy ##top ##athic effect . in addition , we showed that cv ##l ##21 ##8 is able to suppress the cp ##g - induced il - 6 production in peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells , suggesting that it may also have anti - inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology induced by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . further ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic and toxic ##oki ##net ##ic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cv ##l ##21 ##8 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity , indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . moreover , molecular docking simulation suggested that cv ##l ##21 ##8 may bind to the n - terminal domain of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , providing a possible model to explain its anti ##vira ##l action . we also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the anti ##vira ##l activities of par ##p ##1 inhibitors against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , based on the data present in this study and previous evidence ##s reported in the literature . in summary , the par ##p ##1 inhibitor cv ##l ##21 ##8 discovered by our data - driven drug rep ##osition ##ing framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
abstracts ##ter ##oid compounds , which are expected to have dual functions in blocking host inflammation and mer ##s - co ##v replication , were screened from a chemical library . within this library , ci ##cles ##oni ##de , an inhaled co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid , suppressed human corona ##virus replication in culture ##d cells , but did not suppress replication of respiratory sync ##yt ##ial virus or influenza virus . the effective concentration of ci ##cles ##oni ##de to block sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( the cause of co ##vid - 19 ) replication ( ec ##90 ) was 6 . 3 μ ##m . after the eleventh consecutive mer ##s - co ##v passage in the presence of ci ##cles ##oni ##de , a resistant mutation was generated , which resulted in an amino acid substitution ( a2 ##5 ##v ) in non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein ( ns ##p ) 15 , as identified using reverse genetics . a rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus with the mutation was also resistant to ci ##cles ##oni ##de suppression of viral replication . these observations suggest that the effect of ci ##cles ##oni ##de was specific to corona ##virus , suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering mer ##s or co ##vid - 19 .  
to date , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v . here we report a 38 ##2 - nt del ##eti ##on covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 ( or ##f ##8 ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in singapore . the del ##eti ##on also removes the or ##f ##8 transcription - regulatory sequence ( tr ##s ) , which in turn enhance ##s the downstream transcription of the n gene . we also found that viruses with the del ##eti ##on have been circulating for at least four weeks . during the sar ##s - co ##v outbreak in 2003 , a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [ 1 ] , and similar variation has since been observed across sar ##s - related co ##vs in humans and bats . overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or del ##eti ##ons in or ##f ##8 , that have been associated with reduced replica ##tive fitness of the virus [ 2 ] . this is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human sar ##s cases possessed an or ##f ##8 del ##eti ##on that may be associated with host adaptation [ 1 ] . we therefore hypothesis ##e that the major del ##eti ##on revealed in this study may lead to an at ##ten ##uated ph ##eno ##type of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the emergence of the novel human corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wu ##han , china has caused a worldwide epidemic of respiratory disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) . vaccines and targeted therapeutic ##s for treatment of this disease are currently lacking . here we report a human mono ##cl ##onal antibody that neutral ##izes sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( and sar ##s - co ##v ) . this cross - neutral ##izing antibody targets a communal ep ##ito ##pe on these viruses and offers potential for prevention and treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
the detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is emerging as a new tool for the corona ##virus disease - 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) diagnosis . since many corona ##virus ##es are sensitive to heat , heating ina ##ct ##ivation of samples at 56 [UNK] prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission , but the effect of heating on the measurement of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies is still unclear . by comparing the levels of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies before and after heat ina ##ct ##ivation of serum at 56 [UNK] for 30 minutes using a quantitative flu ##orescence im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic ass ##ay , we shown that heat ina ##ct ##ivation significantly interfere ##s with the levels of antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the i ##gm levels of all the 34 serum samples ( 100 % ) from co ##vid - 19 patients decreased by an average level of 53 . 56 % . the i ##gg levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples ( 64 . 71 % ) by an average level of 49 . 54 % . similar changes can also be observed in the non - co ##vid - 19 diseases group ( n = 9 ) . of note , 44 . 12 % of the detected i ##gm levels were dropped below the cut - off value after heating , suggesting heat ina ##ct ##ivation can lead to false - negative results of these samples . our results indicate that heat ina ##ct ##ivation of serum at 56 [UNK] for 30 minutes interfere ##s with the im ##mun ##oa ##nal ##ysis of antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . heat ina ##ct ##ivation prior to im ##mun ##oa ##nal ##ysis is not recommended and the possibility of false - negative results should be considered if the sample was pre - inactivated by heating .  
as new cases of sar ##s co ##v - 2 ( aka 2019 - nc ##ov ) corona ##virus are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into qu ##aran ##tine , hit the developing world , such as sub - saharan africa , potentially leading to a global human cal ##ami ##ty . it is still early days , but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suit ##ability of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus throughout a typical cl ##ima ##to ##logical year . the current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with corona ##virus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions . the predecessor sar ##s - co ##v was linked to similar climate conditions . should the spread of sar ##s co ##v - 2 continue to follow current trends , a worst - case scenario of sync ##hr ##ono ##us global pan ##de ##mic is imp ##ro ##ba ##ble . more probable is the emergence of as ##yn ##ch ##ron ##ous seasonal global outbreak ##s much like other respiratory diseases . people in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable . those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability , while the disease will likely marginal ##ly affect the tr ##op ##ics . our projections minimize uncertain ##ties related with spread of sar ##s co ##v - 2 , providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social , economic and political responses .  
abstract ##man ##y detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and / or surveillance of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . among them , reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) is the most sensitive , claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses . however , it has been reported that only 47 - 59 % of the positive cases were identified by rt - pc ##r , probably due to loss or degradation of virus rna in the sampling process , or even mutation of the virus genome . therefore , developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities . with the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings , we developed a multiple ##x - pc ##r - based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific prime ##rs , and demonstrated its efficiency to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at low copy numbers . the ass ##ay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes , which allowed for direct identification of positive ##s by electro ##ph ##ores ##is . in addition , optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus ( es ) for specific strain discrimination , which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative . finally , we also developed in parallel a multiple ##x - pc ##r - based meta ##gen ##omic method that is am ##ena ##ble to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , with the additional benefit of its potential for uncover ##ing mutation ##al diversity and novel pathogen ##s at low sequencing depth .

summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , a member of the corona ##virus family , has caused a global public health emergency . 1 based on our analysis of hepatitis c virus and corona ##virus replication , and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors , we previously reasoned that the fda - approved he ##pta ##ti ##tis c drug ep ##cl ##usa ( so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir / ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir ) should inhibit corona ##virus ##es , including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . 2 here , using model polymer ##ase extension experiments , we demonstrate that the activated trip ##hos ##phate form of so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir is incorporated by low - fidelity polymer ##ase ##s and sar ##s - co ##v rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) , and blocks further incorporation by these polymer ##ase ##s ; the activated trip ##hos ##phate form of so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir is not incorporated by a host - like high - fidelity dna polymer ##ase . using the same molecular insight , we selected two other anti - viral agents , al ##ov ##udi ##ne and az ##t ( an fda approved hiv / aids drug ) for evaluation as inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp . we demonstrate the ability of two hiv reverse transcript ##ase inhibitors , 3 ’ - flu ##oro - 3 ’ - de ##ox ##yt ##hy ##mi ##dine trip ##hos ##phate and 3 ’ - az ##ido - 3 ’ - de ##ox ##yt ##hy ##mi ##dine trip ##hos ##phate ( the active trip ##hos ##phate forms of al ##ov ##udi ##ne and az ##t ) , to be incorporated by sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp where they also terminate further polymer ##ase extension . given the 98 % amino acid similarity of the sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp ##s , we expect these nu ##cle ##otide analogue ##s would also inhibit the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 polymer ##ase . these results offer guidance to further modify these nu ##cle ##otide analogue ##s to generate more potent broad - spectrum anti - corona ##virus agents .  
abstract ##the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through human - to - human transmission via respiratory droplets and direct or close contact to the patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the other potential transmission routes remain to be further researched . in some clinical cases , samples of tears and con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l secret ##ions from both sar ##s - co ##v [ 1 ] and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients with con ##jun ##ct ##iv ##itis [ 2 ] displayed detect ##able viral rna . a previous study reported the case of a clinic ##ian who was infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 while working with patients under all safeguard ##s except eye protection [ 2 ] . by contrast , no sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could be detected by rt - pc ##r in 114 con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l sw ##ab ##s samples from patients with co ##vid - 19 pneumonia [ 4 ] . anatomical ##ly , the link ##age of the o ##cular with respiratory tissues is primarily by the nas ##ola ##cr ##ima ##l system [ 5 ] . the potential extra - respiratory trans ##missible routes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 via o ##cular remained unclear . whether o ##cular con ##jun ##ct ##iva is one of the portals that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enters the host needs to be further research by laboratory - confirmation for providing significant data to oversight and prevention in people .  
abstract ##an outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , began in wu ##han and spread globally . recently , it has been reported that discharged patients in china and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering . however , it remains unclear whether the con ##vale ##sc ##ing patients have a risk of “ re ##la ##pse ” or “ rein ##fect ##ion ” . the longitudinal tracking of re - exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected monkeys was performed in this study . we found that weight loss in some monkeys , viral replication mainly in nose , ph ##ary ##nx , lung and gut , as well as moderate inter ##sti ##tial pneumonia at 7 days post - infection ( d ##pi ) were clearly observed in r ##hes ##us monkeys after the primary infection . after the symptoms were alleviate ##d and the specific antibody tested positively , the half of infected monkeys were rec ##hall ##eng ##ed with the same dose of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain . notably , neither viral loads in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and anal sw ##ab ##s along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post - rein ##fect ##ion ( d ##pr ) was found in re - exposed monkeys . combined with the follow - up vi ##rol ##og ##ic , radio ##logical and path ##ological findings , the monkeys with re - exposure showed no rec ##ur ##rence of co ##vid - 19 , similarly to the infected monkey without rec ##hall ##eng ##e . taken together , our results indicated that the primary sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection could protect from subsequent exposure ##s , which have the reference of pro ##gno ##sis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design .  
one of the reasons for the fast spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field . molecular techniques , such as quantitative real - time rt - pc ##r and nuclei ##c acid sequencing methods , are widely used to identify pathogen ##s . for this particular virus , however , they have an overall un ##sat ##is ##fying detection rate , due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features . in addition , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is remarkably similar to other corona ##virus ##es , and it can present with other respiratory infections , making identification even harder . to tackle this issue , we propose an assisted detection test , combining molecular testing with deep learning . the proposed approach employs a state - of - the - art deep con ##vo ##lu ##tion ##al neural network , able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus . experiments on data from the novel corona ##virus resource ( 2019 ##nco ##vr ) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , distinguishing it from other corona ##virus strains , such as mer ##s - co ##v , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 , and sar ##s - co ##v regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing ( noise ) . from a data ##set of 55 ##3 complete genome non - repeated sequences that vary from 1 , 260 to 31 , 02 ##9 bp ##s in length , the proposed approach class ##ifies the different corona ##virus ##es with an average accuracy of 98 . 75 % in a 10 - fold cross - validation , identifying sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with an au ##c of 98 % , specific ##ity of 0 . 99 ##39 and sensitivity of 1 . 00 in a binary classification . then , using the same basis , we classify sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from 38 ##4 complete viral genome sequences with human host , that contain the gene or ##f ##1 ##ab from the nc ##bi with a 10 - fold accuracy of 98 . 17 % , a specific ##ity of 0 . 97 ##9 ##7 and sensitivity of 1 . 00 . these preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . at this end the interaction between vi ##rom ##ics and deep learning , will hopefully help to solve global infection problems . in addition , we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors , vi ##rol ##ogist ##s and scientists involved in solving the sar ##s - co
abstract ##the appearance of the novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 represents a major threat to human health , and its diffusion around the world is causing dramatic consequences . the knowledge of the 3d structures of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules . specifically , comparative analyses of the structures of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins and homo ##log ##ous proteins from previously characterized viruses , such as sar ##s - co ##v , can reveal the common and / or distinctive traits that under ##lie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system . here ##in , we apply our recently developed energy - based methods for the prediction of antibody - binding ep ##ito ##pes and protein - protein interaction regions to the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike proteins from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . our analysis focus ##ses only on the study of the structure of rb ##ds in isolation , without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties . importantly , our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be im ##mun ##ore ##active and bind / eli ##cit antibodies . these results provide a rational basis to the observation that several sar ##s - co ##v rd ##b - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies fail to app ##re ##cia ##bly bind the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 counterpart . furthermore , we correctly identify the region of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d that is engaged by the cell receptor ace ##2 during viral entry into host cells . the data , sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions .

abstract ##17 years after the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic , the world is facing the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . co ##vid - 19 is caused by a corona ##virus named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . given the most optimistic projections est ##imating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine , our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus - specific targets for small molecule interventions . all corona ##virus ##es utilize a molecular mechanism called - 1 pr ##f to control the relative expression of their proteins . prior analyses of sar ##s - co ##v revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three - stemmed mrna pseudo ##k ##not to stimulate high rates of - 1 pr ##f , that it also harbor ##s a - 1 pr ##f at ##ten ##uation element . altering - 1 pr ##f activity negatively impacts virus replication , suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutic ##ally targeted . here we present a comparative analysis of the original sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 frames ##hi ##ft signals . structural analyses reveal that the core - 1 pr ##f signal , composed of the u u ##ua aa ##c slippery site and three - stemmed mrna pseudo ##k ##not is highly conserved . in contrast , the upstream at ##ten ##ua ##tor hair ##pin is less well conserved . functional ass ##ays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of - 1 pr ##f and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ab ##late - 1 pr ##f activity . we suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v mediated - 1 pr ##f may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pan ##de ##mic .

summary ##cu ##rre ##ntly , co ##vid - 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has been widely spread around the world ; nevertheless , so far there exist no specific anti ##vira ##l drugs for treatment of the disease , which poses great challenge to control and contain the virus . here , we reported a research finding that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 invaded host cells via a novel route of cd ##14 ##7 - spike protein ( sp ) . sp bound to cd ##14 ##7 , a receptor on the host cells , thereby media ##ting the viral invasion . our further research confirmed this finding . first , in vitro anti ##vira ##l tests indicated me ##pl ##az ##uma ##b , an anti - cd ##14 ##7 human ##ized antibody , significantly inhibit ##ed the viruses from invading host cells , with an ec ##50 of 24 . 86 μ ##g / ml and ic ##50 of 15 . 16 μ ##g / ml . second , we valid ##ated the interaction between cd ##14 ##7 and sp , with an affinity constant of 1 . 85 ##× ##10 ##− ##7 ##m . co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation and elisa also confirmed the binding of the two proteins . finally , the local ##ization of cd ##14 ##7 and sp was observed in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells by im ##mun ##o - electron microscope . therefore , the discovery of the new route cd ##14 ##7 - sp for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific anti ##vira ##l drugs .

letter to the editor . there is no abstract . the summary was showed : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has inevitably mu ##tated during its pan ##de ##mic spread to cause unpredictable effects on co ##vid - 19 and com ##pl ##icate epidemic control efforts . here we report that a novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mutation ( or ##f ##3 ##a ) appears to be spreading worldwide , which deserves close attention .  
the global outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has been declared a pan ##de ##mic by the who . as the number of imported sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cases is on the rise in brazil , we use incidence and historical air travel data to estimate the most important routes of import ##ation into the country .  
stability of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in different environmental conditions .  
a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is associated with the current global pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . bats and pang ##olin ##s are suspected as the reservoir and the intermediate host . the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein plays the key role in the tight binding to human receptor ace ##2 for viral entry . here , we analyzed the worldwide rb ##d mutants and found 18 mutant strains fell into 8 mutation types under high positive selection pressure during the spread . the equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant ( k ##d ) of three types of rb ##d mutants emerging in wu ##han , shenzhen , hong kong and france were two orders of magnitude lower than the prototype wu ##han - hu - 1 strain due to the stabilization of the beta - sheet sc ##af ##fold of the rb ##d . this indicated that the mu ##tated viruses may have evolved to acquire remarkably increased in ##fect ##ivity . five france isolate ##s and one hong kong isolate shared the same rb ##d mutation enhancing the binding affinity , which suggested that they may have originated as a novel sub - lineage . the k ##d values for the bat and the pang ##olin sar ##s - like co ##v rb ##ds indicated that it would be difficult for bat sar ##s - like co ##v to in ##fect humans ; however , the pang ##olin co ##v is potentially infectious to humans with respect to its rb ##d . these analyses of critical rb ##d mutations provide further insights into the evolutionary trend of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 under high selection pressure . the enhancement of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binding affinity to ace ##2 reveals a possible higher risk of more severe virus transmissions during a sustained pan ##de ##mic of co ##vid - 19 if no effective precautions are implemented .  
abstract ##the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside china with major outbreak ##s occurring in italy , south korea and iran . phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequencing data identified a distinct sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clade linked to travellers returning from iran to australia and new zealand . this study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in iran , and under ##sco ##res the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases .  
summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a zoo ##not ##ic virus that has caused a pan ##de ##mic of severe respiratory disease — co ##vid - 19 — within several months of its initial identification . comparable to the first sar ##s - co ##v , this novel corona ##virus ’ s surface spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein media ##tes cell entry via the human ace - 2 receptor , and , thus , is the principal target for the development of vaccines and im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##cs . molecular information on the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein remains limited . here we report the crystal structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s receptor - binding - domain ( rb ##d ) at a the highest resolution to date , of 1 . 95 a . we identified a set of sar ##s - reactive mono ##cl ##onal antibodies with cross - react ##ivity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d and other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s . one of these antibodies , cr ##30 ##22 , was previously shown to syn ##er ##gi ##ze with antibodies that target the ace - 2 binding site on the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d and reduce viral escape capacity . we determined the structure of cr ##30 ##22 , in complex with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d , and defined a broadly reactive ep ##ito ##pe that is highly conserved across beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . this ep ##ito ##pe is inaccessible in the “ closed ” pre ##fusion s structure , but is accessible in “ open ” conform ##ations . this first - ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the broad react ##ivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ep ##ito ##pe will allow antigen ##ic assessment of vaccine candidates , and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine , im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##c and diagnostic strategies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and related beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es . highlights ##hi ##gh resolution structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor - binding - domain ( rb ##d ) . recognition of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d by sar ##s - co ##v antibodies . structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d in complex with antibody cr ##30 ##22 . identification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike .  
abstract ##the world health organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of co ##vid - 19 , which is caused by a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , as pan ##de ##mic . there is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response eli ##cite ##d from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . one major im ##mun ##ological question is concerning the antigen ##ic differences between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . we address this question by using plasma from patients infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or sar ##s - co ##v , and plasma obtained from infected or im ##mun ##ized mice . our results show that while cross - react ##ivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common , cross - neutral ##ization of the live viruses is rare , indicating the presence of non - neutral ##izing antibody response to conserved ep ##ito ##pes in the spike . whether these non - neutral ##izing antibody responses will lead to antibody - dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future . overall , this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigen ##ici ##ty differences between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v , but also has important implications in vaccine development .  
during the past three months , a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) epidemic has been growing exponential ##ly , affecting over 100 thousand people worldwide , and causing enormous distress to economies and societies of affected countries . a pl ##eth ##ora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published , in scientific journals as well as through non - peer reviewed channels , to investigate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genetic het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y and spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al dissemination . we examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and ph ##yl ##oge ##ographic studies . our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data , in light of which any finding should be considered , at the very best , preliminary and hypothesis - generating . hence the need for avoiding stigma ##ti ##zation based on partial information , and for continuing concert ##ed efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic .  
the newly emerged pan ##de ##mic corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has posed a significant public health threat worldwide . however , the mode of virus transmission and tissue tr ##op ##ism is not well established yet . recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ace ##2 + cho ##lang ##io ##cytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize that human liver duct ##al organ ##oids could serve as a model to determine the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and mechanisms under ##lining the liver damage upon sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . by single - cell rna sequencing , we found that long - term liver duct ##al organ ##oid culture preserved the human specific ace ##2 + population of cho ##lang ##io ##cytes . moreover , human liver duct ##al organ ##oids were per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and support robust replication . notably , virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cho ##lang ##io ##cytes through d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation , which could explain the bile acid accumulation and con ##se ##quent liver damage in patients . these results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating co ##vid - 19 patients . our findings also provide an application of human organ ##oids in investigating the tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which would facilitate novel drug discovery .  
summary ##the recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) by corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source . whole genome analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 revealed ~ 96 % gen ##omic similarity with bat co ##v ( rat ##g ##13 ) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree . furthermore , rat ##gl ##3 also showed 97 . 43 % spike protein similarity with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 suggesting that rat ##gl ##3 is the closest strain . however , rb ##d and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human - to - human and cross - species transmission are homo ##logue ##s between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and pang ##olin co ##vs . these results from our analysis suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus of bat and pang ##olin co ##vs . moreover , this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s sign ##ifying its apt ##itude for evolution . in short , our findings propose that homo ##log ##ous rec ##om ##bina ##tion has been occurred between bat and pang ##olin co ##vs that triggered cross - species transmission and emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and , during the ongoing outbreak , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is still evolving for its adapt ##ability .  
abstract ##pan ##de ##mic corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , for which there are no e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccines or therapeutic ##s that are urgently needed . we expressed three versions of spike ( s ) proteins — receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) , s ##1 subunit and s ec ##to ##dom ##ain — in insect cells . rb ##d appears mono ##mer in solutions , whereas s ##1 and s associate into homo ##tri ##mer with substantial g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion . the three proteins con ##fer excellent antigen ##ici ##ty with six con ##vale ##scent co ##vid - 19 patient sera . cry ##o - electron microscopy ( cry ##o - em ) analyses indicate that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s trim ##er dominate in a unique conform ##ation distinguished from the classic pre ##fusion conform ##ation of corona ##virus ##es by the upper s ##1 region at lower position ~ 15 a pro ##xi ##mal to viral membrane . such conform ##ation is proposed as an early pre ##fusion state for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike that may broad ##en the knowledge of corona ##virus and facilitate vaccine development .  
summary ##the rapid and es ##cala ##ting spread of sar ##s corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) poses an immediate public health emergency , and no approved therapeutic ##s or vaccines are currently available . the viral spike protein s binds ace ##2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intra ##cellular ##ly . soluble ace ##2 inhibit ##s entry of both sar ##s and sar ##s - 2 corona ##virus ##es by acting as a deco ##y for s binding sites , and is a candidate for therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic development . using deep mu ##tage ##nes ##is , variants of ace ##2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of s at a cell surface . mutations are found across the interface and also at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance folding and presentation of the interaction ep ##ito ##pe . the n ##90 - g ##ly ##can on ace ##2 hind ##ers association . the mutation ##al landscape offers a blue ##print for engineering high affinity ace ##2 receptors to meet this unprecedented challenge .  
background : the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 shares 74 . 5 % genome identity with sar ##s - co ##v , both exhibiting a similar well conserved structure . therefore , antibodies produced in co ##vid - 19 and sar ##s patients should not be that di ##ssi ##mi ##lar . we evaluated sar ##s - co ##v test ass ##ays to detect for the presence of antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients . methods : tests were carried out using elisa ( total antibodies ) and indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ( ii ##fa ) ( i ##gm & i ##gg ) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . results : cross - react ##ivity was seen in these two test ass ##ays with sera from co ##vid - 19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms . five of the patients had detect ##able antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of ser ##oco ##n ##version in 4 patients . the ii ##fa method was marginal ##ly more sensitive compared to the elisa ass ##ay , however the ii ##fa i ##gm test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity . conclusions : existing diagnostic ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with co ##vid - 19 . these ass ##ays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific ser ##ology tests for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the who has declared sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern . however , to date , there was hardly any study in character ##izing the immune responses , especially adaptive immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . in this study , we collected blood from co ##vid - 19 patients who have recently become virus - free and therefore were discharged , and analyzed their sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific antibody and t cell responses . we observed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific humor ##al and cellular immunity in the patients . both were detected in newly discharged patients , suggesting both participate in immune - mediated protection to viral infection . however , follow - up patients ( 2 weeks post discharge ) exhibited high ti ##ters of i ##gg antibodies , but with low levels of virus - specific t cells , suggesting that they may enter a qui ##es ##cent state . our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and understanding the pathogen ##esis of co ##vid - 19 , especially in the severe cases . it has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) that originated in the city of wu ##han , china has now spread to every inhabit ##able continent , but now the ##att ##ent ##ion has shifted from china to other epic ##enter ##s , especially italy . this study explored the influence of spatial pro ##xi ##mit ##ies and travel patterns from italy on the further spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 around the globe . we showed that as the epic ##enter changes , the dynamics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread change to reflect spatial pro ##xi ##mit ##ies .  
introduction : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( severe acute respiratory disease corona ##virus 2 ) , which causes corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid ##19 ) was first detected in china in late 2019 and has since then caused a global pan ##de ##mic . while molecular ass ##ays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection , we currently lack ser ##ological ass ##ays suitable to specifically detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies . methods : here we describe ser ##ological enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ) that we developed using rec ##om ##bina ##nt antigen ##s derived from the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . these ass ##ays were developed with negative control samples representing pre - co ##vid 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from co ##vid ##19 patients . results : the ass ##ays are sensitive and specific , allowing for screening and identification of co ##vid ##19 ser ##oco ##n ##vert ##ers using human plasma / serum as early as 3 days post sy ##mpt ##om onset . importantly , these ass ##ays do not require handling of infectious virus , can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amend ##able to scaling . conclusion : ser ##ological ass ##ays are of critical importance to determine ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce in a given population , define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of con ##vale ##scent serum as therapeutic . sensitive and specific identification of corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibody ti ##ters will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients mini ##mi ##zing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients .  
given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , known as 2019 - nc ##ov ) infection ( co ##vid - 19 ) , the ongoing global sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue . rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for dia ##gno ##sing co ##vid - 19 , providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control . a one - step reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) coupled with nano ##par ##tic ##les - based bio ##sen ##sor ( n ##bs ) ass ##ay ( rt - lamp - n ##bs ) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately dia ##gno ##sing co ##vid - 19 . a simple equipment ( such as heating block ) was required for maintaining a constant temperature ( 63 c ) for only 40 min . using two designed lamp prime ##r sets , f1 ##ab ( opening reading frame 1a / b ) and np ( nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ) genes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one - step and single - tube reaction , and the detection results were easily interpreted by n ##bs . the sensitivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - lamp - n ##bs was 12 copies ( each of detection target ) per reaction , and no cross - react ##ivity was generated from non - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 template ##s . among clinical ##ly diagnosed co ##vid - 19 patients , the analytical sensitivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was 100 % ( 33 / 33 ) in the oro ##pha ##ryn ##x sw ##ab samples , and the ass ##ay ' s specific ##ity was also 100 % ( 96 / 96 ) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non - co ##vid - 19 patients . the total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h . in sum , the rt - lamp - n ##bs is a promising tool for dia ##gno ##sing the current sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in first line field , public health and clinical laboratories , especially for resource - challenged regions .  
abstract ##a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory syndrome , co ##vid - 19 . to compare its pathogen ##esis with that of previously emerging corona ##virus ##es , we in ##oc ##ulated cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or mer ##s - co ##v and compared with historical sar ##s - co ##v infections . in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected mac ##aq ##ues , virus was ex ##cre ##ted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs , and detected in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes in f ##oc ##i of diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage and mu ##cous glands of the nasal cavity . in sar ##s - co ##v - infection , lung lesions were typically more severe , while they were mild ##er in mer ##s - co ##v infection , where virus was detected mainly in type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . these data show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can cause a co ##vid - 19 - like disease , and suggest that the severity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is intermediate between that of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . one sentence summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in mac ##aq ##ues results in co ##vid - 19 - like disease with prolonged virus ex ##cre ##tion from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs .  
a new corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has recently emerged to cause a human pan ##de ##mic . whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed , ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays are still lacking , yet urgently needed . valid ##ated ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays are important for contact tracing , identifying the viral reservoir and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies . here , we developed ser ##ological ass ##ays for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 neutral ##izing , spike - and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id - specific antibodies . using serum samples from patients with pc ##r - confirmed infections of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , other corona ##virus ##es , or other respiratory pathogen ##ic infections , we valid ##ated and tested various antigen ##s in different in - house and commercial elisa ##s . we demonstrate that most pc ##r - confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected individuals ser ##oco ##n ##verted , as revealed by sensitive and specific in - house elisa ##s . we found that commercial s ##1 i ##gg or i ##ga elisa ##s were of lower specific ##ity while sensitivity varied between the two , with i ##ga showing higher sensitivity . overall , the valid ##ated ass ##ays described here can be instrumental for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific antibodies for diagnostic , ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological and vaccine evaluation studies .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , a member of the corona ##virus family , is responsible for the current co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . based on our analysis of hepatitis c virus and corona ##virus replication , and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors , we previously demonstrated that three nu ##cle ##otide analogue ##s inhibit the sar ##s - co ##v rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) . here , using polymer ##ase extension experiments , we have demonstrated that the active trip ##hos ##phate form of so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir ( a key component of the fda approved hepatitis c drug ep ##cl ##usa ) , is incorporated by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp , and blocks further incorporation . using the same molecular insight , we selected the active trip ##hos ##phate forms of three other anti - viral agents , al ##ov ##udi ##ne , az ##t ( an fda approved hiv / aids drug ) and ten ##of ##ov ##ir ala ##fen ##ami ##de ( ta ##f , an fda approved drug for hiv and hepatitis b ) for evaluation as inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp . we demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymer ##ase inhibitors , 3 ′ - flu ##oro - 3 ′ - de ##ox ##yt ##hy ##mi ##dine trip ##hos ##phate , 3 ′ - az ##ido - 3 ′ - de ##ox ##yt ##hy ##mi ##dine trip ##hos ##phate and ten ##of ##ov ##ir dip ##hos ##phate ( the active trip ##hos ##phate forms of al ##ov ##udi ##ne , az ##t and ta ##f , respectively ) to be incorporated by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp , where they also terminate further polymer ##ase extension . these results offer a strong molecular basis for these nu ##cle ##otide analogue ##s to be evaluated as potential therapeutic ##s for co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreak ##s , most recently exemplified by the newly emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here ##in , we show that the rib ##on ##uc ##le ##osi ##de analog β - d - n ##4 - hydro ##xy ##cy ##ti ##dine ( nh ##c , e ##id ##d - 1931 ) has broad spectrum anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v 2 , mer ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v , and related zoo ##not ##ic group 2 ##b or 2 ##c bat - co ##vs , as well as increased pot ##ency against a corona ##virus bearing resistance mutations to another nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog inhibitor . in mice infected with sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v , both prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic administration of e ##id ##d - 280 ##1 , an oral ##ly bio ##ava ##ila ##ble nh ##c - pro ##dr ##ug ( b - d - n ##4 - hydro ##xy ##cy ##ti ##dine - 5 ’ - iso ##pro ##py ##l este ##r ) , improved pulmonary function , and reduced virus ti ##ter and body weight loss . decreased mer ##s - co ##v yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell rna , supporting a mechanism of lethal mu ##tage ##nes ##is . the pot ##ency of nh ##c / e ##id ##d - 280 ##1 against multiple corona ##virus ##es , its therapeutic efficacy , and oral bio ##ava ##ila ##bility in vivo , all highlight its potential utility as an effective anti ##vira ##l against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other future zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es .  
a recent outbreak of novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 , has spread rapidly all over the world . human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) is another deadly virus and causes acquired im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency syndrome ( aids ) . rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk . here , we present an all - in - one dual crisp ##r - cas ##12 ##a ( termed ai ##od - crisp ##r ) ass ##ay method for simple , rapid , ultra ##sen ##sit ##ive , one - pot , and visual detection of corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and hiv virus . in our ai ##od crisp ##r ass ##ay , a pair of cr ##rna ##s was introduced to initiate dual crisp ##r - cas ##12 ##a detection and improve detection sensitivity . the ai ##od - crisp ##r ass ##ay system was successfully utilized to detect nuclei ##c acids ( dna and rna ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and hiv with a sensitivity of few copies . also , it was evaluated by detecting hiv - 1 rna extracted from human plasma samples , achieving a comparable sensitivity with real - time rt - pc ##r method . thus , our method has a great potential for developing next - generation point - of - care molecular diagnostic ##s .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is an emerging global health crisis . with over 200 , 000 confirmed cases to date , this pan ##de ##mic continues to expand , spur ##ring research to discover vaccines and the ##ra ##pies . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the novel corona ##virus responsible for this disease . it initiate ##s entry into human cells by binding to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) via the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of its spike protein ( s ) . disrupt ##ing the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - rb ##d binding to ace ##2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells , presenting a new mod ##ality for therapeutic intervention . peptide - based bind ##ers are an attractive solution to inhibit the rb ##d - ace ##2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface . using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ace ##2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - rb ##d co - crystal structure , we observed that the ace ##2 pep ##ti ##das ##e domain ( pd ) α ##1 helix is important for binding sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - rb ##d . using automated fast - flow peptide synthesis , we chemical ##ly synthesized a 23 - mer peptide fragment of the ace ##2 pd α ##1 helix composed entirely of protein ##ogenic amino acids . chemical synthesis of this human derived sequence was complete in 1 . 5 hours and after work up and isolation > 20 mill ##ig ##ram ##s of pure material was obtained . bio - layer inter ##fer ##ome ##try revealed that this peptide specifically associates with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - rb ##d with low nano ##mo ##lar affinity . this peptide bind ##er to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - rb ##d provides new avenues for co ##vid - 19 treatment and diagnostic mod ##ali ##ties by blocking the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein interaction with ace ##2 and thus pre ##cl ##uding virus entry into human cells .  
to ultimately combat the emerging co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly con ##tag ##ious disease caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus . our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus , as well as the spike ( s ) protein , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein , and membrane ( m ) protein , have been tested for vaccine development against sar ##s and mer ##s . however , these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns . we then applied the va ##xi ##gn reverse va ##cci ##nology tool and the newly developed va ##xi ##gn - ml machine learning tool to predict co ##vid - 19 vaccine candidates . by investigating the entire pro ##te ##ome of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , six proteins , including the s protein and five non - structural proteins ( ns ##p ##3 , 3 ##cl - pro , and ns ##p ##8 - 10 ) , were predicted to be ad ##hes ##ins , which are crucial to the viral ad ##hering and host invasion . the s , ns ##p ##3 , and ns ##p ##8 proteins were also predicted by va ##xi ##gn - ml to induce high protective antigen ##ici ##ty . besides the commonly used s protein , the ns ##p ##3 protein has not been tested in any corona ##virus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation . the ns ##p ##3 was found to be more conserved among sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , sar ##s - co ##v , and mer ##s - co ##v than among 15 corona ##virus ##es in ##fect ##ing human and other animals . the protein was also predicted to contain prom ##is ##cu ##ous m ##hc - i and m ##hc - ii t - cell ep ##ito ##pes , and linear b - cell ep ##ito ##pes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein . by applying reverse va ##cci ##nology and machine learning , we predicted potential vaccine targets for effective and safe co ##vid - 19 vaccine development . we then propose that an sp / ns ##p cocktail vaccine containing a structural protein ( s ) ( sp ) and a non - structural protein ( s ) ( ns ##p ) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses .  
the recent outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) virus has highlighted the need for fast and e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine development . stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of ep ##ito ##pes to circulating t - cells via the h ##la complex . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a large rna virus and testing of all overlapping peptide ##s in vitro to deco ##n ##vo ##lu ##te an immune response is not feasible . therefore h ##la - binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptide ##s to test . we tested 15 ep ##ito ##pe - h ##la - binding prediction tools , and using an in vitro peptide m ##hc stability ass ##ay , we assessed 77 ##7 peptide ##s that were predicted to be good bind ##ers across 11 m ##hc all ##otype ##s . in this investigation of potential sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ep ##ito ##pes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability , and they are highly dependent on the m ##hc all ##otype in question . designing a co ##vid - 19 vaccine where only a few ep ##ito ##pe targets are included is therefore a very challenging task . here , we present 174 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ep ##ito ##pes with high prediction binding scores , valid ##ated to bind stab ##ly to 11 h ##la all ##otype ##s . our findings may contribute to the design of an e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine against co ##vid - 19 .  
co ##vid - 19 has become a global pan ##de ##mic caused by a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . understanding the origins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is critical for deter ##ring future zoo ##nosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development . we show evidence of strong pu ##ri ##fying selection around the receptor binding motif ( rb ##m ) in the spike gene and in other genes among bat , pang ##olin and human corona ##virus ##es , indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species . we also demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ' s entire rb ##m was introduced through rec ##om ##bina ##tion with corona ##virus ##es from pang ##olin ##s , possibly a critical step in the evolution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ' s ability to in ##fect humans . similar pu ##ri ##fying selection in different host species and frequent rec ##om ##bina ##tion among corona ##virus ##es suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human corona ##virus ##es .  
co ##vid - 19 is caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and has become a global pan ##de ##mic . there is no highly effective medicine or vaccine , most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response , especially the virus specific i ##gg and i ##gm responses . however , the i ##gg / i ##gm responses is barely known . to enable the global understanding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific i ##gg / i ##gm responses , a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome micro ##ar ##ray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed . the micro ##ar ##ray was applied to profile the i ##gg / i ##gm responses with 29 con ##vale ##scent sera . the results suggest that at the con ##vale ##scent phase 100 % of patients had i ##gg / i ##gm responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , especially to protein n , s ##1 but not s ##2 . s ##1 pu ##rified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate co ##vid - 19 patients from controls . besides protein n and s ##1 , significant antibody responses to or ##f ##9 ##b and ns ##p ##5 were also identified . in - depth analysis showed that the level of s ##1 i ##gg positively co ##rre ##late to age and the level of ld ##h ( lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ) , especially for women , while the level of s ##1 i ##gg negatively co ##rre ##late to l ##y % ( l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte percentage ) . this study presents the first whole picture of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific i ##gg / i ##gm responses , and provides insights to develop precise im ##mun ##o - diagnostic ##s , effective treatment and vaccine .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020 . at present , it is of utmost importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs and develop new active compounds . while some animal models for such studies are under development , most of the research is carried out in the ve ##ro e ##6 cells . here , we propose fully differentiated human air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um cultures as a model for studies on the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . further , we also provide basic characteristics of the system .  
co ##vid - 19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pan ##de ##mic by who . currently , there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease . drug rep ##osition ##ing represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of fifty fda - approved drugs that have been pre - selected by an ass ##ay of sar ##s - co ##v was screened to identify potential anti ##vira ##l drug candidates against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . we found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited anti ##vira ##l efficacy ( 0 . 1 μ ##m < ic ##50 < 10 μ ##m ) against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in particular , two fda - approved drugs – nic ##los ##ami ##de and ci ##cles ##oni ##de – were notable in some respects . these drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their anti ##vira ##l activities . in near future , these already fda - approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with co ##vid - 19 .  
the ongoing pan ##de ##mic of the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v ##2 ) . we have performed an integrated sequence - based analysis of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome ##s from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in sar ##s - co ##v and other related corona ##virus family genome ##s , con ##fer ##ring unique infection , fa ##ci ##lita ##tion of transmission , vi ##ru ##lence and im ##mun ##ogenic features to the virus . the ph ##yl ##ogen ##y of the genome ##s yields some interesting results . systematic gene level mutation ##al analysis of the genome ##s has enabled us to identify several unique features of the sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome , which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( a ##9 ##30 ##v ( 243 ##51 ##c > t ) ) in the indian sar ##s - co ##v ##2 , absent in other strains studied here . we have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein function and stability , using computational approach . to gain further insights into host responses to viral infection , we predict that anti ##vira ##l host - mir ##nas may be controlling the viral pathogen ##esis . our analysis reveals nine host mir ##nas which can potentially target sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genes . interesting ##ly , the nine mir ##nas do not have targets in sar ##s and mer ##s genome ##s . also , hs ##a - mir - 27 ##b is the only unique mir ##na which has a target gene in the indian sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome . we also predicted immune ep ##ito ##pes in the genome ##s .  
since sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection was first identified in december 2019 , it spread rapidly and a global pan ##de ##mic of co ##vid - 19 has occurred . ace ##2 , the receptor for entry into the target cells by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , was found to abundant ##ly express in test ##es , including sperm ##ato ##gon ##ia , ley ##di ##g and ser ##to ##li cells . however , there is no clinical evidence about whether sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection can affect male go ##nad ##al function so far . in this study , we compared the sex - related hormones between 81 reproductive - aged men with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and 100 age - matched healthy men , and found that serum lu ##tein ##izing hormone ( l ##h ) was significantly increased , but the ratio of testosterone ( t ) to l ##h and the ratio of f ##oll ##icle stimulating hormone ( f ##sh ) to l ##h were dramatically decreased in males with co ##vid - 19 . besides , multi ##var ##iable regression analysis indicated that c - reactive protein ( cr ##p ) level was significantly associated with serum t : l ##h ratio in co ##vid - 19 patients . this study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of co ##vid - 19 on male sex hormones , alert ##ing more attention to go ##nad ##al function evaluation among patients recovered from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , especially the reproductive - aged men .  
abstract ##the pan ##de ##mic caused by emerging corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic interventions . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral spike protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) and the ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) target cell receptor . here , we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 rb ##d - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) derived from single b cells of eight sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected individuals . these mab ##s come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire . in samples from one patient selected for further analyses , we found coe ##xi ##sten ##ce of ge ##rm ##line and ge ##rm ##line diver ##gent clones . both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutral ##izing activity against pseudo ##virus and live sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . however , the antibody neutral ##izing pot ##ency is determined by competition with ace ##2 receptor for rb ##d binding . surprisingly , none of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross - reacted with rb ##ds from either sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v although substantial plasma cross - react ##ivity to the trim ##eric spike proteins from sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v was found . these results suggest that antibody response to rb ##ds is viral species - specific while that cross - recognition target regions outside the rb ##d . the specific ##ity and neutral ##izing characteristics of this plasma cross - react ##ivity requires further investigation . nevertheless , the diverse and potent neutral ##izing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 interventions .  
an outbreak of the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 respiratory disease , has infected over 290 , 000 people since the end of 2019 , killed over 12 , 000 , and caused worldwide social and economic disruption . there are currently no anti ##vira ##l drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention . unfortunately , the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . to ill ##umi ##nate this , we clone ##d , tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity - purification mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ( ap - ms ) , which identified 332 high confidence sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - human protein - protein interactions ( pp ##is ) . among these , we identify 67 drug ##ga ##ble human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing fda - approved drugs , drugs in clinical trials and / or pre ##cl ##ini ##cal compounds , that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ass ##ays . the identification of host dependency factors media ##ting virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other deadly corona ##virus strains .  
we probe how genetic variability across the three major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex ( m ##hc ) class i genes ( human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen [ h ##la ] a , b , and c ) may affect su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the virus responsible for corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . we execute a comprehensive in si ##lic ##o analysis of viral peptide - m ##hc class i binding affinity across all known h ##la - a , - b , and - c gen ##otype ##s for all sar ##s - co ##v - 2 peptide ##s . we further explore the potential for cross - protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human corona ##virus ##es . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of h ##la all ##eles . however , we found that h ##la - b * 46 : 01 had the few ##est predicted binding peptide ##s for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , suggesting individuals with this all ##ele may be particularly vulnerable to co ##vid - 19 , as they were previously shown to be for sar ##s ( 1 ) . conversely , we found that h ##la - b * 15 : 03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved sar ##s - co ##v - 2 peptide ##s that are shared among common human corona ##virus ##es , suggesting it could enable cross - protective t - cell based immunity . finally , we report global distributions of h ##la types with potential ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ram ##ification ##s in the setting of the current pan ##de ##mic .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic is straining healthcare resources worldwide , prompting social di ##stan ##cing measures to reduce transmission intensity . the amount of social di ##stan ##cing needed to curb the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic in the context of seasonal ##ly varying transmission remains unclear . using a mathematical model , we assessed that one - time interventions will be insufficient to maintain co ##vid - 19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the united states . seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn . intermittent di ##stan ##cing measures can maintain control of the epidemic , but without other interventions , these measures may be necessary into 202 ##2 . increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care .  
background : the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is straining health systems around the world . although the chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people ' s movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread , the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent trans ##mis ##sibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all . following its emergence , the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in asia , western europe , australia , canada and the united states , and finally in south america and africa . as the virus continues its global spread , a clear and evidence - based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions . methods : we employ molecular surveillance data of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic ##s for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pan ##de ##mic declaration . our goal was to character ##ize the spatial - temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pan ##de ##mic . we exploited a network - based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings . specifically , it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral gen ##omic variants via mutation trees , which are then used to in ##fer transmission networks , revealing an up - to - date picture of the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 between and within countries and geographic regions . results and conclusions : the analysis suggest multiple introductions of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 into the majority of world regions by means of het ##ero ##gen ##eous transmission pathways . the transmission network is scale - free , with a few gen ##omic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions . the network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs . the in ##fer ##red network structural properties , transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link ##age and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures .  
as a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , it is important to character ##ize cd ##8 + t cell ep ##ito ##pes in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pep ##ti ##dome that can trigger adaptive immune responses . here , we use rose ##tta ##m ##hc , a comparative modeling approach which leverage ##s existing high - resolution x - ray structures from peptide / m ##hc complexes available in the protein data bank , to derive physically realistic 3d models for high - affinity sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ep ##ito ##pes . we outline an application of our method to model 43 ##9 9 ##mer and 279 10 ##mer predicted ep ##ito ##pes displayed by the common all ##ele h ##la - a * 02 : 01 , and we make our models publicly available through an online database ( https : / / rose ##tta ##m ##hc . chemistry . uc ##sc . ed ##u ) . as more detailed studies on antigen - specific t cell recognition become available , rose ##tta ##m ##hc models of antigen ##s from different strains and h ##la all ##eles can be used as a basis to understand the link between peptide / h ##la complex structure and surface chemistry with im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity , in the context of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
lack of evidence on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and drop ##let isolation precautions . during the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with co ##vid - 19 infection , air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shed ##ding from isolated individuals . while all individuals were confirmed positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , symptoms and viral shed ##ding to the environment varied considerably . many commonly used items , toilet facilities , and air samples had evidence of viral contamination , indicating that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is shed to the environment as expired particles , during toilet ##ing , and through contact with f ##omi ##tes . disease spread through both direct ( drop ##let and person - to - person ) as well as indirect contact ( contaminated objects and airborne transmission ) are indicated , supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions .  
the scientific community is focus ##sed on developing anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies to mit ##igate the impacts of the ongoing novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) outbreak . this will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts . here , using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen ( throat / nasal sw ##ab ##s or nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al / sp ##ut ##um / tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rate ) , we compare within - host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v infections . our quantitative analyses revealed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of mer ##s - co ##v , but are similar to severe cases , and that the viral dynamics of sar ##s - co ##v infection are similar to those of mer ##s - co ##v in mild cases but not in severe case . consequently , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of un ##lice ##nsed drugs that have different methods of action . the effectiveness was measured by au ##c of viral load . our results indicated that the ##ra ##pies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load ( which occurs around three days after sy ##mpt ##om onset on average ) , but the ##ra ##pies that promote cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city are likely to have only limited effects . our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in humans , which are useful for development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies .  
zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infections , like those responsible for the current sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic , cause grave international public health concern . in infected cells , the co ##v rna - synth ##es ##izing machinery associates with modified end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organ ##elle ( ro ) . while double - membrane ve ##sic ##les ( d ##m ##vs ) appear to be a pan - corona ##virus ro element , studies to date describe an assortment of additional corona ##virus - induced membrane structures . despite much speculation , it remains unclear which ro element ( s ) accommodate viral rna synthesis . here we provide detailed 2d and 3d analyses of co ##v ro ##s and show that diverse co ##vs essentially induce the same membrane modifications , including the small open double - membrane sp ##her ##ules ( d ##ms ##s ) previously thought to be restricted to gamma - and delta - co ##v infections and proposed as sites of replication . metabolic label ##ling of newly - synthesized viral rna followed by quantitative em auto ##rad ##iography revealed abundant viral rna synthesis associated with d ##m ##vs in cells infected with the beta - co ##vs mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v , and the gamma - co ##v infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus . rna synthesis could not be linked to d ##ms ##s or any other cellular or virus - induced structure . our results provide a un ##ifying model of the co ##v ro and clearly establish d ##m ##vs as the central hub for viral rna synthesis and a potential drug target in corona ##virus infection .  
abstract ##a novel corona ##virus ( the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has been identified in january 2020 as the causal pathogen for co ##vid - 19 pneumonia , an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in wu ##han , china . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was found to be closely related to the sar ##s - co ##v , based on the gen ##omic analysis . the ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 protein ( ace ##2 ) utilized by the sar ##s - co ##v as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ace ##2 . using homo ##logy modeling and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation methods , we report here the detailed structure of the ace ##2 in complex with the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein . the predicted model is highly consistent with the experimental ##ly determined complex structures . besides the binding interface reported in the crystal structures , new plausible binding poses were revealed from all - atom md simulations . the simulation data helped identify critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d and human ace ##2 . two mutants mimic ##king rat ace ##2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on rb ##d binding to ace ##2 . the simulations showed that the n - terminal helix and the k ##35 ##3 are very important for the tight binding of the complex , the mutants were found to alter the binding modes of the co ##v ##2 - rb ##d to ace ##2 .  
abstract ##fin ##ding vaccine or specific anti ##vira ##l treatment for global pan ##de ##mic of virus diseases ( such as the ongoing co ##vid - 19 ) requires rapid analysis , ann ##ota ##tion and evaluation of meta ##gen ##omic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nu ##cle ##otide sequences . traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment - free techniques for sequence analysis . information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences . in 2013 , our research group ( nagar ##aj et al . , eu ##r . ph ##ys . j . special topics 222 ( 3 - 4 ) , 2013 ) has proposed a novel measure known as effort - to - com ##press ( etc ) based on the notion of compression - complexity to capture the information content of sequences . in this study , we propose a compression - complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of sar ##s corona ##virus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nu ##cle ##otide sequences . we also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from sar ##s - co ##v - 1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nu ##cle ##otide sequences . this work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and character ##izing sar ##s corona ##virus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and / or incomplete segments of nu ##cle ##otide sequences . potentially , the need for sequence assembly can be ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##ed . note ##the main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the international conference on nonlinear systems and dynamics ( cn ##sd - 2013 ) held at indian institute of technology , indo ##re , december 12 , 2013 . in this manuscript , we have extended our preliminary analysis to include sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus as well .  
abstract ##the current practice for diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection relies on pc ##r testing of nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al or respiratory specimens in a sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic patient at high ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic risk . this testing strategy likely under ##est ##imate ##s the true prevalence of infection , creating the need for ser ##olo ##gic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date . here , we describe the development of a corona ##virus antigen micro ##ar ##ray containing im ##mun ##ological ##ly significant antigen ##s from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in addition to sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , common human corona ##virus strains , and other common respiratory viruses . a preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic demonstrates overall high i ##gg react ##ivity to common human corona ##virus ##es and low i ##gg react ##ivity to epidemic corona ##virus ##es including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , with some cross - react ##ivity of conserved antigen ##ic domains including s ##2 domain of spike protein and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . this array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , including whether baseline ser ##ology for other corona ##virus ##es impacts disease course , how the antibody response to infection develops over time , and what antigen ##s would be optimal for vaccine development .  
the corona ##virus disease - 19 ( co ##vid ##19 ) that started in wu ##han , china in december 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pan ##de ##mic . the severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has so far claimed more than 14 , 500 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide . development of universal vaccines against the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 holds utmost urgency to control co ##vid ##19 pan ##de ##mic that appears to be more severe than any of the previous outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle - east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . however , as the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 displays high transmission rates , the underlying severity hidden in the sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome ##s is required to be fully understood . we studied the complete genome ##s of 95 strains of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reported from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of spread of the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 across the globe . we show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighbouring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries . we revealed unique single nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) in ns ##p ##13 , ns ##p ##14 , ns ##p ##15 , ns ##p ##16 ( present in or ##f ##1 ##b poly ##pro ##tein region ) and s - protein within 10 viral isolate ##s from usa . these viral proteins are involved in rna replication and processing , indicating highly evolved strains of the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 circulating in the population of usa than in other countries . furthermore , we found an isolate from usa ( mt ##18 ##8 ##34 ##1 ) to carry frames ##hi ##ft mutation between positions 254 ##0 and 257 ##0 of ns ##p ##16 which functions as mrna cap - 1 methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( 2 ′ - o - mt ##ase ) . thus , we reason that the replica ##tive machinery of the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges and survival . these mutations are needed to be considered , otherwise it will be difficult to develop effective treatment strategies . the two proteins also had d ##n / ds values approaching 1 - or ##f ##1 ##ab poly ##pro ##tein ( d ##n / ds = 0 . 99 ##6 , 0 . 57 ##5 ) and s protein ( d ##n / ds = 0 . 88 ) and might con ##fer selective advantage to the virus . through the construction of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - human interact ##ome , we further reveal multiple host proteins ( ph ##b
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 emerged in china at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pan ##de ##mic with over 400 , 000 recorded co ##vid - 19 cases and greater than 19 , 000 recorded deaths by march 24th , 2020 ( www . who . org ) ( 1 ) . there are no fda approved anti ##vira ##ls or vaccines for any corona ##virus , including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( 2 ) . current treatments for co ##vid - 19 are limited to supportive the ##ra ##pies and off - label use of fda approved drugs ( 3 ) . rapid development and human testing of potential anti ##vira ##ls is greatly needed . a potentially quicker way to test compounds with anti ##vira ##l activity is through drug re - pu ##rp ##osing ( 2 , 4 ) . numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects , making them easier to test in co ##vid - 19 patients . here , we present data on 20 fda approved drugs tested for anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that we have previously found to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v ( 4 ) . we find that 17 of these also inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at a range of ic ##50 values at non - cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c concentrations . from these we specifically followed up with hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e sulfate and ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e phosphate .  
recent reports suggest an association between co ##vid - 19 and altered ol ##factory function . here we analyze bulk and single cell rna - se ##q data ##set ##s to identify cell types in the ol ##factory ep ##ith ##eli ##um that express molecules that media ##te infection by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( co ##v - 2 ) , the causal agent in co ##vid - 19 . we find in both mouse and human data ##set ##s that ol ##factory sensory neurons do not express two key genes involved in co ##v - 2 entry , ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . in contrast , ol ##factory ep ##ith ##elial support cells and stem cells express both of these genes , as do cells in the nasal respiratory ep ##ith ##eli ##um . taken together , these findings suggest possible mechanisms through which co ##v - 2 infection could lead to an ##os ##mia or other forms of ol ##factory dysfunction .  
the outbreak of sar ##s corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which occurred in wu ##han , china in december 2019 , has caused a worldwide pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . however , there is a lack of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological tools to guide effective public policy development . here we present ep ##ide ##mi ##ological evidence that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s type exited wu ##han or other epic ##enter ##s in china earlier than l type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations . analysis of regional di ##spar ##ities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemic ##s is a useful sur ##rogate indicator for the undo ##cum ##ented spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country . this study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus .  
since its emergence and detection in wu ##han , china in late 2019 , the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread to nearly every country around the world , resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date . the virus was first detected in the pacific northwest region of the united states in january , 2020 , with subsequent co ##vid - 19 outbreak ##s detected in all 50 states by early march . to uncover the sources of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 introductions and patterns of spread within the u . s . , we sequence ##d nine viral genome ##s from early reported co ##vid - 19 patients in connecticut . our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genome ##s with viruses sequence ##d from washington state . by coupling our gen ##omic data with domestic and international travel patterns , we show that early sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission in connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions . moreover , the risk of domestic import ##ation to connecticut exceeded that of international import ##ation by mid - march regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions . this study provides evidence for widespread , sustained transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 within the u . s . and highlights the critical need for local surveillance .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the et ##iol ##ogical agent responsible for the co ##vid - 19 outbreak in wu ##han . specific anti ##vira ##l drug are urgently needed to treat co ##vid - 19 infections . the main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a key co ##v enzyme that plays a pivotal role in media ##ting viral replication and transcription , which makes it an attractive drug target . in an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting mp ##ro , two compounds ( 11 ##a and 11 ##b ) were designed and synthesized , both of which exhibited excellent inhibitor ##y activity with an ic ##50 value of 0 . 05 μ ##m and 0 . 04 μ ##m respectively . significantly , both compounds exhibited potent anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection activity in a cell - based ass ##ay with an ec ##50 value of 0 . 42 μ ##m and 0 . 33 μ ##m , respectively . the x - ray crystal structures of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mp ##ro in complex with 11 ##a and 11 ##b were determined at 1 . 5 a resolution , respectively . the crystal structures showed that 11 ##a and 11 ##b are ir ##re ##vers ##ible , the al ##deh ##yde groups of which are bound co ##valent ##ly to cy ##s ##14 ##5 of mp ##ro . both compounds are promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies .  
novel sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused a pan ##de ##mic condition world - wide and has been declared as public health emergency of international concern by who in a very short span of time . the community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of china , italy , spain and usa among others . the prop ##hyl ##actic solution against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its rna genome . here ##in , we exploited a next generation va ##cci ##nology approach to construct a multi - ep ##ito ##pe vaccine candidate against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with high antigen ##ici ##ty , safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent . the whole pro ##te ##ome was sc ##rut ##ini ##zed for the screening of highly conserved , antigen ##ic , non - all ##er ##gen and non - toxic ep ##ito ##pes having high population coverage that can eli ##cit both humor ##al and cellular mediated immune response against co ##vid - 19 infection . these ep ##ito ##pes along with four different ad ##ju ##vant ##s were utilized to construct a multi - ep ##ito ##pe vaccine candidate that can generate strong im ##mun ##ological memory response having high efficacy in humans . various ph ##ys ##io ##chemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high prop ##ens ##ity to form a protective solution against the detrimental sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain with high efficacy . the vaccine candidate interact ##ed with im ##mun ##ological receptor t ##lr ##3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity . further , the cod ##on optimization and in si ##lic ##o expression show the pl ##aus ##ibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product . thus , this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an e ##ffi ##ca ##cious protective vaccine for combat ##ing co ##vid - 19 .  
the corona ##virus disease co ##vid - 19 , caused by emerging sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has posed serious threats to global public health , economic and social stab ##ili ##ties , calling for the prompt development of therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s . in this study , we firstly verified that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 uses human ace ##2 as a cell receptor and its spike ( s ) protein media ##tes high membrane fusion activity . comparing to that of sar ##s - co ##v , the he ##pta ##d repeat 1 ( hr ##1 ) sequence in the s ##2 fusion protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 possesses markedly increased α - he ##lic ##ity and the ##rm ##osta ##bility , as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding he ##pta ##d repeat 2 ( hr ##1 ) site . then , we designed a hr ##2 sequence - based lip ##ope ##pt ##ide fusion inhibitor , termed ip ##b ##0 ##2 , which showed highly poe ##nt activities in in ##ib ##ib ##iting the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein - mediated cell - cell fusion and pseudo ##virus infection . ip ##b ##0 ##2 also inhibit ##ed the sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##virus efficiently . moreover , the st ##rc ##ut ##ure and activity relationship ( sar ) of ip ##b ##0 ##2 were character ##zi ##zed with a panel of truncated lip ##ope ##pt ##ides , revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and anti ##vira ##l capacities . therefore , the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the design of anti ##vira ##ls that target the membrane fusion step .  
the disease known as corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , potentially caused by an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in wu ##han , china , has hit the world hard , and has led to an un ##pre ##cede ##nt health and economic crisis . in order to develop treatment options able to stop or am ##eli ##ora ##te sar ##s - co ##v - 2 effects , we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells , but this kind of studies are still scarce . a recent study investigated trans ##lat ##ome and pro ##te ##ome host cell changes induced in vitro by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in the present study , we use the publicly available pro ##te ##omics data from this study to re - analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis . proteins linked to inflammatory response , but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mit ##osis , were found to be regulated . the up - regulation of the inflammatory - related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of co ##vid - 19 patients .  
abstract ##out ##break of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) occurred in wu ##han and has rapidly spread to almost all parts of world . in corona ##virus ##es , the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the distal part of s ##1 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein can directly bind to ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . rb ##d promote viral entry into the host cells and is an important therapeutic target . in this study , we discovered that the ##af ##lav ##in showed the lower id ##ock score ( id ##ock score : − ##7 . 95 kc ##al / mo ##l ) . to confirm the result , we discovered that the ##af ##lav ##in showed full ##fi ##tness score of − ##9 ##9 ##1 . 21 kc ##al / mo ##l and estimated δ ##g of − ##8 . 53 kc ##al / mo ##l for the most favorable interaction with contact area of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d by swiss ##dock service . regarding contact modes , hydro ##phobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were formed between the ##af ##lav ##in and ar ##g ##45 ##4 , ph ##e ##45 ##6 , as ##n ##46 ##0 , cy ##s ##48 ##0 , g ##ln ##49 ##3 , as ##n ##50 ##1 and val ##50 ##3 of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d , near the direct contact area with ace ##2 . our results suggest that the ##af ##lav ##in could be the candidate of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry inhibitor for further study .  
the pathogen ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 1 ) and co ##vid - 19 corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) have all emerged into the human population with devastating consequences . these viruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike ( s ) to engage host cell receptors and cat ##aly ##ze membrane fusion . because of the vital role that these s proteins play , they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutic ##s to combat these highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es . here , we describe the isolation and characterization of single - domain antibodies ( v ##hh ##s ) from a ll ##ama im ##mun ##ized with pre ##fusion - stabilized corona ##virus spikes . these v ##hh ##s are capable of potent ##ly neutral ##izing mer ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v - 1 s pseudo ##type ##d viruses . the crystal structures of these v ##hh ##s bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct ep ##ito ##pes , but both v ##hh ##s block receptor binding . we also show cross - react ##ivity between the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 s - directed v ##hh and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s , and demonstrate that this cross - reactive v ##hh is capable of neutral ##izing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s pseudo ##type ##d viruses as a bi ##valent human i ##gg fc - fusion . these data provide a molecular basis for the neutral ##ization of pathogen ##ic beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es by v ##hh ##s and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutic ##s during corona ##virus outbreak ##s .  
the emergence of the beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that causes co ##vid - 19 , represents a significant threat to global human health . vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humor ##al immune response , the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , that media ##tes cell entry and membrane fusion . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s gene en ##codes 22 n - linked g ##ly ##can se ##qu ##ons per proto ##mer , which likely play a role in immune eva ##sion and o ##cc ##lu ##ding im ##mun ##ogenic protein ep ##ito ##pes . here , using a site - specific mass spec ##trom ##et ##ric approach , we reveal the g ##ly ##can structures on a rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s im ##mun ##ogen . this analysis enables mapping of the g ##ly ##can - processing states across the viral spike . we show how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s g ##ly ##cans differ from typical host g ##ly ##can processing , which may have implications in viral path ##ob ##iology and vaccine design .  
background : the spread of an novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , previously named 2019 - nc ##ov ) has already taken on pan ##de ##mic proportions , affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks . el ##uc ##ida ##ting the diagnostic value of different methods , especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is helpful for improving the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of pathogen ##ic - diagnosis , providing timely treatment , and different ##iating the infected cases from the healthy , thus preventing further epidemic ##s . methods : medical records from 38 patients with confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in the second people ' s hospital of fu ##yang from january 22 , 2020 to february 28 , 2020 were collected and retrospective ##ly analyzed . specimens including throat sw ##ab ##s , sp ##ut ##um and serum were collected during the hospital ##ization period , viral rna ##s and serum i ##gm - i ##gg antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were measured respectively . the detect ##ability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection were analyzed . results : among 38 patients , the total ser ##op ##osi ##tive rate for i ##gm and i ##gg was 50 . 0 % and 92 . 1 % , respectively . two patients remained ser ##one ##gative throughout the course of illness . in the early phase of illness , the rna test for sp ##ut ##um specimens possessed the highest detect ##ability ( 92 . 3 % ) , followed by the the rna test for throat sw ##ab ##s ( 69 . 2 % ) , and the antibodies ass ##ays presented lower positive rates ( i ##gm , 23 . 0 % , i ##gg , 53 . 8 % ) . while , the sensitivity of antibodies ass ##ays overtook that of rna test since day 8 after onset ( i ##gm , 50 . 0 % ; i ##gg , 87 . 5 % ) . of note , the positive rate of throat sw ##ab ##s was only 13 . 0 % for cases in later phase ( ≥ ##15 d . a . o ) , and the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of i ##gm and i ##gg rose to 52 . 2 % and 91 . 3 % , respectively . combined use of antibodies ass ##ay and q ##rt - pc ##r at the same time was able to improve the sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of pathogen ##ic - diagnosis , especially for the throat sw ##ab ##s group at the later stage of illness . moreover , most of these cases with und ##ete ##ctable viral rna in throat sw ##ab ##s specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be i ##gm / i
abstract purpose : the aim of the present study was to assess whether sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can be detected in the expressed pro ##static secret ##ion ( eps ) of patients with corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . methods : 18 cases of co ##vid - 19 , and 5 suspected cases , were selected from three medical centers to detect the rna expression of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in their eps with rt - pc ##r . results : results were negative in all eps samples for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 of suspected and confirmed patients . conclusions : no sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was expressed in eps of patients with co ##vid - 19 .  
background limited data exist on how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enters and spreads in the general population . methods we used two strategies for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing : targeted testing of high - risk individuals ( n = 4 , 55 ##1 ) and a population screening ( n = 5 , 50 ##2 ) . we sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from 340 individuals . results on march 22 2020 , 52 ##8 had tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the targeted testing ( 11 . 6 % ) and 50 in the population screening ( 0 . 9 % ) ; approximately 0 . 2 % of the icelandic population . large fraction ##s of positive ##s had travelled outside iceland ( 38 . 4 % and 34 . 0 % ) . fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older : 2 . 8 % vs . 12 . 3 % for targeted testing ( p = 1 . 6 ##e - 9 ) and 0 . 0 % vs . 1 . 0 % for population screening ( p = 0 . 03 ##1 ) . fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males ( 9 . 5 % vs . 14 . 6 % , p = 6 . 8 ##e - 9 ) . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 came from eight clade ##s , seven a clade ##s and one b clade . the clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time . in the early targeted testing , 65 . 0 % of clade ##s were a2 ##a1 and a2 ##a ##2 derived from italian and austrian skiing areas , but in the later targeted testing went down to 30 . 6 % and were over ##taken by a1 ##a and a2 ##a , the most common clade ##s in the population screening . conclusion sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread widely in iceland outside of the high - risk groups . several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly . children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males . to contain the pan ##de ##mic we must increase the scope of the testing .  
co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has under ##lined the impact of emerge ##nt pathogen ##s as a major threat for human health . the development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease . in this work , several mathematical models are proposed to represent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dynamics in infected patients . considering different starting times of infection , parameters sets that represent in ##fect ##ivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pan ##de ##mics . based on the target cell model , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect ##ing time between susceptible cells ( mean of 30 days approximately ) is much slower than those reported for e ##bola ( about 3 times slower ) and influenza ( 60 times slower ) . the within - host reproductive number for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection ( 1 . 7 - 5 . 35 ) . the best model to fit the data was including immune responses , which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms . the model with eclipse phase , time in a late ##nt phase before becoming productive ##ly infected cells , was not supported . interesting ##ly , both , the target cell model and the model with immune responses , predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection , and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection . a quantitative comprehension of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work .  
background : since its identification on the 7th of january 2020 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide , causing > 11 , 000 deaths . at present , viral disease and transmission amongst children is incomplete ##ly understood . specifically , there is concern that children could be an important source of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in household transmission clusters . methods : we performed an observation ##al study anal ##ys ##ing literature published between december 2019 and march 2020 of the clinical features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms . findings : drawing on studies from china , singapore , south korea , japan , and iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children . these ranged from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to severe disease . of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified , 9 . 7 % ( 3 / 31 ) were identified as having a pa ##ed ##ia ##tric index case . this is in contrast other zoo ##not ##ic infections ( namely h ##5 ##n ##1 influenza virus ) where 54 % ( 30 / 56 ) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case . interpretation : whilst sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can cause mild disease in children , the data available to date suggests that children have not played a substantive role in the intra - household transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
co ##vid - 19 has quickly become a worldwide pan ##de ##mic , which has significantly impacted the economy , education , and social interactions . understanding the humor ##al antibody response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins may help identify bio ##mark ##ers that can be used to detect and treat co ##vid - 19 infection . however , no im ##mun ##o - pro ##te ##omics platform exists that can perform such pro ##te ##ome - wide analysis . to address this need , we created a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome micro ##ar ##ray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptide ##s 15 amino acids long with 5 - amino acid offset ##s representing full - length sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins . moreover , the array processing time is short ( 1 . 5 hours ) , the dynamic range is ~ 2 orders of magnitude , and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg / ml . here , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for sar ##s - co ##v - 1 proteins can also target sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins . these readily available re ##age ##nts could be used immediately in co ##vid - 19 research . second , i ##gm and i ##gg im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins were profile ##d in the serum of ten co ##vid - 19 patients . such ep ##ito ##pe bio ##mark ##ers provide insight into the immune response to co ##vid - 19 and are potential targets for co ##vid - 19 diagnosis and vaccine development . finally , ser ##ological antibodies that may neutral ##ize viral entry into host cells via the ace ##2 receptor were identified . further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is warrant ##ed . antibody and ep ##ito ##pe prof ##iling in response to co ##vid - 19 is possible with our peptide - based sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome micro ##ar ##ray . the data g ##lean ##ed from the array could provide in ##val ##ua ##ble information to the scientific community to understand , detect , and treat co ##vid - 19 .  
in december 2019 , an outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia ( corona ##virus disease 2019 - co ##vid - 19 ) associated with a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was reported in wu ##han city , hub ##ei province , china . the outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed . the rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrant ##s immediate intervention . the intra - host gen ##omic variability of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective anti ##vira ##l agents and vaccines , but also in the design of accurate diagnostic ##s . we analyzed ng ##s data derived from clinical samples of three chinese patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in order to identify small - and large - scale intra - host variations in the viral genome . we identified tens of low - or higher - frequency single nu ##cle ##otide variations ( s ##n ##vs ) with variable density across the viral genome , affecting 7 out of 10 protein - coding viral genes . the majority of these s ##n ##vs corresponded to miss ##ense changes . the ann ##ota ##tion of the identified s ##n ##vs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed col ##oca ##lization of intra - host but also strain specific s ##n ##vs with prime ##rs and probe ##s currently used in molecular diagnostic ##s ass ##ays . moreover , we de - novo assembled the viral genome , in order to isolate and valid ##ate intra - host structural variations and rec ##om ##bina ##tion break ##points . the bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis disclosed gen ##omic rear ##rang ##ement ##s over poly - a / poly - u regions located in or ##f ##1 ##ab and spike ( s ) gene , including a potential rec ##om ##bina ##tion hot - spot within s gene . our results highlight the intra - host gen ##omic diversity and plastic ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , pointing out gen ##omic regions that are prone to alterations . the isolated s ##n ##vs and gen ##omic rear ##rang ##ement ##s , reflect the intra - patient capacity of the poly ##morphic quasi ##sp ##ec ##ies , which may arise rapidly during the outbreak , allowing im ##mun ##ological escape of the virus , offering resistance to anti - viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostic ##s ass ##ays .  
the effect of the rapid accumulation of non - synonymous mutations on the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is not yet known . to predict the impact of non - synonymous mutations and poly ##pro ##line regions identified in or ##f ##3 ##a on the formation of b - cell ep ##ito ##pes and their role in eva ##ding the immune response , nu ##cle ##otide and protein sequences of 53 ##7 available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s were analyzed for the presence of non - synonymous mutations and poly ##pro ##line regions . mutations were correlated with changes in ep ##ito ##pe formation . a total of 19 different non - synonymous amino acids substitution ##s were detected in or ##f ##3 ##a among 53 ##7 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains . g ##25 ##1 ##v was the most common and identified in 9 . 9 % ( n = 53 ) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a b - cell like ep ##ito ##pe in or ##f ##3 ##a . poly ##pro ##line regions were detected in two strains ( ep ##i _ is ##l _ 410 ##48 ##6 , france and ep ##i _ is ##l _ 407 ##0 ##7 ##9 , finland ) and affected ep ##ito ##pes formation . the accumulation of non - synonymous mutations and detected poly ##pro ##line regions in or ##f ##3 ##a of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could be driving the eva ##sion of the host immune response thus favor ##ing viral spread . rapid mutations acc ##um ##ulating in or ##f ##3 ##a should be closely monitored throughout the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic .  
as the co ##vid - 19 outbreak spreads , there is a growing need for a compilation of conserved rna genome regions in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus along with their structural prop ##ens ##ities to guide development of anti ##vira ##ls and diagnostic ##s . using sequence alignment ##s spanning a range of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , we rank gen ##omic regions by rna sequence conservation , identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nu ##cle ##otide ##s as exactly conserved over sar ##s - related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the co ##vid - 19 outbreak . we then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 73 ##9 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences reported to date from the current co ##vid - 19 outbreak , and we present a curated list of 30 ′ sar ##s - related - conserved ′ regions . we find that known rna structured elements curated as rf ##am families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions , and we predict additional conserved , stable secondary structures across the viral genome . we provide 106 ′ sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - conserved - structured ′ regions as potential targets for anti ##vira ##ls that bind to structured rna . we further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5 ′ ut ##r , frame - shifting element , and 3 ′ ut ##r . last , we predict regions of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral genome have low prop ##ens ##ity for rna secondary structure and are conserved within sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains . these 59 ′ sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - conserved - un ##st ##ructured ′ gen ##omic regions may be most easily targeted in prime ##r - based diagnostic and ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide - based therapeutic strategies .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) quickly became a major epidemic threat in the whole china . we anal ##yse ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected cases from tibetan autonomous prefecture , and noted diver ##gent characteristics of these tibetan ##s infected cases compared to han chinese , character ##izing by a considerable proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers ( 21 . 7 % ) , and few sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic patients with initial sy ##mpt ##om of fever ( 7 . 7 % ) . here , we did a descriptive study on clinical characteristics of 18 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . the median age of these as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers was 31 years and one third of them were students , aged under 20 years . notably , some of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers had recognizable changes in radio ##logical and laboratory index ##es . our finding indicates a potentially big number of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers in prevalent area , highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close contact of infected patients , for a better control on the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract the world health organisation has declared a pan ##de ##mic caused by the newly discovered sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . due to growing demand for re ##age ##nts used for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna extraction for subsequent molecular diagnostic ##s , there is a worldwide risk of kit - and / or re ##age ##nt - shortages for extraction . with a detection sensitivity of 97 . 4 % ( 95 % ci = 86 . 2 - 99 . 9 % ) , we describe a simple , fast , alternative work ##flow for molecular detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , where samples are simply heat - processed for 5 minutes at 98 ##° ##c prior to the rt - q ##pc ##r reaction .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread globally , resulting in > 300 , 000 reported cases worldwide as of march 21st , 2020 . here we investigate the genetic diversity and gen ##omic ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in northern california using samples from returning travelers , cruise ship passengers , and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources . virus genome ##s were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with co ##vid - 19 infection from feb 3rd through mar 15th . phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different sar ##s - co ##v - 2 lineage ##s , suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state . virus genome ##s from passengers on two consecutive excursion ##s of the grand princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in washington state , including the wa ##1 genome representing the first reported case in the united states on january 19th . we also detected evidence for pre ##sum ##ptive transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 lineage ##s from one community to another . these findings suggest that cryptic transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in northern california to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel , rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage . rapid testing and contact tracing , social di ##stan ##cing , and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread in california and other regions of the usa .  
the ongoing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak has killed over twenty - one thousand and sick ##ened over four hundred thousand people worldwide , posing a great challenge to global public health . a sensitive and accurate diagnosis method will substantially help to control disease expansion . here , we developed a che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence - im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y method based on the rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antigen and the magnetic beads for diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections and surveillance of antibody changing pattern . serum ##s from 29 healthy individuals , 51 tuberculosis patients , and 79 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 confirmed patients were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach . compared to the i ##gm testing , the i ##gg testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections from the 79 confirmed patients and only two false - positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specific ##ity reaching 82 . 28 % and 97 . 5 % , respectively . however , only a slight difference ( not statistical ##ly significant ) in the detected cases of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections was observed between the i ##gm and i ##gg testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease . a performance comparison between an elisa kit using the same nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antigen and our che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence method was undertaken . the same false - positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group , while elisa kit can only detect half of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections from paired sar ##s - co ##v - 2 confirmed patients group than that of the che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence method , indicating a higher performance for the che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence - im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y approach . together , our studies provide a useful and valuable ser ##ological testing tool for the diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections in the community .  
while l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yt ##open ##ia is a common characteristic of patients infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the mechanisms responsible for this de ##ple ##tion are unclear . through careful inspection of the sp ##leen ##s and l ##ym ##ph nodes ( l ##ns ) from six cases with post ##mo ##rte ##m examinations , we observed that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could directly in ##fect secondary l ##ym ##ph ##oid organs to induce cell death . im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry demonstrated ace ##2 ( ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ) , the potential receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , expresses on tissue - resident cd ##16 ##9 + macro ##pha ##ges in sp ##leen ##s and l ##ns . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent stain ##ing confirmed that viral nu ##cle ##oca ##sp ##id protein ( np ) can be found in ace ##2 + cells , cd ##16 ##9 + macro ##pha ##ges , but not in cd ##3 + t cells or b ##22 ##0 + b cells in sp ##leen ##s and l ##ns . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection induce ##s severe tissue damage including l ##ym ##ph f ##oll ##icle de ##ple ##tion , sp ##len ##ic nod ##ule at ##rop ##hy , his ##ti ##oc ##yte hyper ##pl ##asia and l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte reductions . moreover , in situ tune ##l stain ##ing illustrated that viral infection leads to severe l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ap ##op ##tosis , which might be mediated by viral antigen ##s inducing fa ##s up ##re ##gul ##ation . furthermore , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 also triggers macro ##pha ##ges to produce il - 6 , a pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ine that directly promotes l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte nec ##rosis . collectively , these results demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 directly neutral ##izes human sp ##leen ##s and l ##ns through in ##fect ##ing tissue - resident cd ##16 ##9 + macro ##pha ##ges .  
the global pan ##de ##mic of severe acute pneumonia syndrome ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 urgently calls for prevention and intervention strategies . the densely g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted spike ( s ) protein highly exposed on the viral surface is a deter ##mina ##nt for virus binding and invasion into host cells as well as eli ##cit ##ation of a protective host immune response . here ##in , we characterized the site - specific n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein using stepped collision energy ( sc ##e ) mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ( ms ) . following digest ##ion with two complementary pro ##tea ##ses to cover all potential n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion se ##qu ##ons and integrated n - g ##ly ##co ##pro ##te ##omics analysis , we revealed the n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion profile of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s proteins at the levels of intact n - g ##ly ##cope ##pt ##ides and g ##ly ##cos ##ites , along with the g ##ly ##can composition and site - specific number of g ##ly ##cans . all 22 potential canonical n - g ##ly ##cos ##ites were identified in s protein proto ##mer . of those , 18 n - g ##ly ##cos ##ites were conserved between sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s proteins . nearly all g ##ly ##cos ##ites were preserved among the 75 ##3 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequences available in the public influenza database global initiative on sharing all influenza data . by comparison , insect cell - expressed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein contained 38 n - g ##ly ##cans , which were primarily assigned to the high - mann ##ose type n - g ##ly ##cans , whereas the human cell - produced protein possessed up to 140 n - g ##ly ##cans largely belonging to the complex type . in particular , two n - g ##ly ##cos ##ites located in the structurally exposed receptor - binding domain of s protein exhibited a relatively conserved n - g ##ly ##can composition in human cells . this n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion prof ##iling and determination of differences between distinct expression systems could shed light on the infection mechanism and promote development of vaccines and targeted drugs .  
the ongoing co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has reached more than 200 countries and territories worldwide . given the large requirement of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnosis and considering that rna extraction kits are in short supply , we investigated whether two commercial rt - q ##pc ##r kits were compatible with direct sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection from nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab samples . we show that one of the tested kits is fully compatible with direct sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection suggesting that om ##iss ##ion of rna extraction step should be considered in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnosis .  
the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 has now become a global pan ##de ##mic and it continues to spread rapidly worldwide , severely threatening lives and economic stability . making the problem worse , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l drug that can be used to treat co ##vid - 19 to date . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 initiate ##s its entry into human cells by binding to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ha ##ce ##2 ) via the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of its spike protein . therefore , molecules that can block sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from binding to ha ##ce ##2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective anti ##vira ##l drug . based on this idea , we designed a series of peptide ##s that can strongly bind to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d in computational experiments . specifically , we first constructed a 31 - mer pep ##ti ##dic sc ##af ##fold by linking two fragments graf ##ted from ha ##ce ##2 ( a . a . 22 - 44 and 351 - 357 ) with a link ##er g ##ly ##cine , and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d . compare with several computational studies that failed to identify that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 shows higher binding affinity for ha ##ce ##2 than sar ##s - co ##v , our protein design scoring function , ev ##oe ##f ##2 , makes a correct identification , which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data , implying its high accuracy . the top designed peptide bind ##ers exhibited much stronger binding pot ##ency to ha ##ce ##2 than the wild - type ( - 53 . 35 vs . - 46 . 46 ev ##oe ##f ##2 energy unit for design and wild - type , respectively ) . the extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reason ##ability of the designed bind ##ers , which not only rec ##ap ##it ##ulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding . due to the urgent situation created by co ##vid - 19 , we share these computational data to the community , which should be helpful to develop potential anti ##vira ##l peptide drugs to combat this pan ##de ##mic .  
the corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has infected more than 600 , 000 people and has overwhelmed hospital systems around the world . however , the factors media ##ting fatal sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections are poorly understood . here , we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose - dependent up ##re ##gul ##ation of ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor , in rode ##nt and human lungs . using single - cell sequencing data , we demonstrate that ace ##2 is expressed in a subset of ep ##ith ##elial cells that line the respiratory tract , including go ##ble ##t cells , club cells , and al ##ve ##olar type 2 cells . chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mu ##cus - secret ##ing go ##ble ##t cells and a con ##com ##itan ##t increase in ace ##2 expression . in contrast , quit ##ting smoking causes a decrease in lung ace ##2 levels . taken together , these results may partially explain why smoke ##rs are particularly likely to develop severe sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , and they suggest that quit ##ting smoking could less ##en corona ##virus su ##sc ##ept ##ibility .  
we calculated the structural properties of > 2500 corona ##virus ##es and computed > 1000 ##00 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . using the cross method , we found that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 region encompassing nu ##cle ##otide ##s 230 ##00 and 240 ##00 is highly conserved at the structural level , while the region 1000 nu ##cle ##otide ##s up - stream varies significantly . the two sequences code for a domain of the spike s protein that binds to the host receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) that media ##tes human infection and in the homo ##logue from middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) interact ##s with si ##alic acids . we predicted structured regions at the 5 prime and 3 prime ends where our calculations indicate strong prop ##ens ##ity to bind proteins . using the cat ##ra ##pid method , we computed 350 ##0 protein interactions with the 5 prime end and identified cy ##cl ##in t ##1 cc ##nt ##1 , atp - dependent rna he ##lica ##se dd ##x ##1 , zinc finger protein z ##n ##f ##17 ##5 and other 20 high - confidence candidate partners . we propose these proteins , also implicated in hiv replication , to be further investigated for a better understanding of host - virus interaction mechanisms .  
many of the proteins produced by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have related counterparts across the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) family . one such protein is non - structural protein 9 ( ns ##p ##9 ) , which is thought to media ##te both viral replication and vi ##ru ##lence . current understanding suggests that ns ##p ##9 is involved in viral gen ##omic rna reproduction . ns ##p ##9 is thought to bind rna via a fold that is unique to this class of beta ##cor ##ono ##avi ##rus ##es although the molecular basis for this remains ill - defined . we sought to better character ##ise the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ns ##p ##9 protein and subsequently solved its x - ray crystal structure , in an ap ##o - form and , unexpectedly , in a peptide - bound form with a sequence originating from a rhino ##vira ##l 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se sequence ( lev ##l ) . the structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ns ##p ##9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the ns ##p ##9 family . the ex ##ogen ##ous peptide binding site is close to the dime ##r interface and impacted on the relative ju ##xt ##ap ##osition of the mono ##mers within the homo ##dim ##er . together we have established a protocol for the production of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ns ##p ##9 , determined its structure and identified a peptide - binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding ns ##p ##9 function .  
the beginning of 2020 brought us information about the novel corona ##virus emerging in china . rapid research resulted in the characterization of the pathogen , which appeared to be a member of the sar ##s - like cluster , commonly seen in bats . despite the global and local efforts , the virus escaped the healthcare measures and rapidly spread in china and later globally , officially causing a pan ##de ##mic and global crisis in march 2020 . at present , different scenarios are being written to contain the virus , but the development of novel anti ##cor ##ona ##vira ##ls for all highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es remains the major challenge . here , we describe the anti ##vira ##l activity of previously developed by us h ##tc ##c compound ( n - ( 2 - hydro ##xy ##pro ##py ##l ) - 3 - trim ##eth ##yla ##mmon ##ium chi ##tos ##an chloride ) , which may be used as potential inhibitor of currently circulating highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and mer ##s - co ##v .  
understanding the disease pathogen ##esis of the novel corona ##virus , denoted sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , is critical to the development of anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 therapeutic ##s . the global propagation of the viral disease , denoted co ##vid - 19 ( corona ##virus disease 2019 ) , has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitor ##y small molecules or poly ##pe ##pt ##ides . given the known interaction between the human ace ##2 ( ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ) protein and the sar ##s - co ##v virus ( responsible for the corona ##virus outbreak circa . 2003 ) , considerable focus has been directed towards the put ##ative interaction between the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein and ace ##2 . however , a more ho ##listic understanding of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vs . human inter - species interact ##ome promises additional put ##ative protein - protein interactions ( pp ##i ) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitor ##y therapeutic ##s . to that end , we leverage two state - of - the - art , sequence - based pp ##i predict ##ors ( pipe ##4 & sprint ) capable of generating the comprehensive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vs . human interact ##ome , comprising approximately 285 , 000 pair ##wise predictions . of these , we identify the high - scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins by both methods , comprising 279 high - confidence put ##ative interactions involving 225 human proteins . notably , the spike - ace ##2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the pipe ##4 and sprint predict ##ors , co ##rro ##bor ##ating existing evidence for this pp ##i . furthermore , the pipe - sites algorithm was used to predict the put ##ative sub ##se ##que ##nce that might media ##te each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitor ##y poly ##pe ##pt ##ides intended to disrupt the corresponding host - pathogen interactions . we here ##by publicly release the comprehensive set of pp ##i predictions and their corresponding pipe - sites landscapes in the following data ##verse repository : https : / / www . doi . org / 10 . 56 ##8 ##3 / sp ##2 / j ##z ##7 ##7 ##xa . all data and metadata are released under a cc - by 4 . 0 licence . the information provided represents theoretical modeling only and caution should be exercised in its use . it is intended as a resource for the scientific community at large in further ##ing our understanding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
while the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic is hardly hitting the world , it is of extreme importance that significant in vitro observations guide the quick set up of clinical trials . in this study , we evidence that the anti - sar ##s - co ##v ##2 activity of a clinical ##ly ac ##hi ##eva ##ble hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e concentration is maximize ##d only when administered before and after the infection of ve ##ro e ##6 cells . this strongly suggests that only a combined prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic use of hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e may be effective in limiting viral replication in patients .  
oral sw ##ab ##s , sp ##ut ##um and blood samples from 18 patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection were examined using real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) testing . whereas oral sw ##ab ##s or sp ##ut ##um from the lower respiratory tract were tested rt - pc ##r positive in all patients , rna ##emia was neither detected in 3 patients without symptoms nor in 14 patients with flu - like symptoms , fever or pneumonia . the only patient with rna ##emia suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and was artificial ##ly vent ##ila ##ted in an intensive care unit . risk for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission through blood components in as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected individuals therefore seems ne ##gli ##gible but further studies are needed .  
an excessive immune response contributes to sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pathogen ##esis and lethal ##ity , but the mechanism remains unclear . in this study , the n proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were found to bind to mas ##p - 2 , the key ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se in the le ##ct ##in pathway of complement activation , resulting in abe ##rran ##t complement activation and aggravated inflammatory lung injury . either blocking the n protein : mas ##p - 2 interaction or suppress ##ing complement activation can significantly alleviate n protein - induced complement hyper - activation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo . complement hyper - activation was also observed in co ##vid - 19 patients , and a promising suppress ##ive effect was observed when the deteriorating patients were treated with anti - c ##5 ##a mono ##cl ##onal antibody . complement suppression may represent a common therapeutic approach for pneumonia induced by these highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es .  
in the current co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , a significant proportion of cases shed sar ##s - corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) with their fae ##ces . to determine if sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is present in sewage during the emergence of co ##vid - 19 in the netherlands , sewage samples of 7 cities and the airport were tested using rt - pc ##r against three fragments of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein gene ( n ##1 - 3 ) and one fragment of the envelope protein gene ( e ) . no sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was detected in samples of february 6 , three weeks before the first case was reported in the netherlands on february 27 . on march 5 , the n ##1 fragment was detected in sewage of five sites . on march 15 / 16 , the n ##1 fragment was detected in sewage of six sites , and the n ##3 and e fragment were detected at 5 and 4 sites respectively . this is the first report of detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in sewage . the detection of the virus in sewage , even when the co ##vid - 19 incidence is low , indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population .  
background : understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is essential for infection prevention policies . objective : to detect the surface and air contamination by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and study the associated patient - level factors . design : cross - sectional study . setting : airborne infection isolation rooms ( ai ##irs ) at the national centre for infectious diseases , singapore . patients : co ##vid - 19 in ##patient ##s with a positive pc ##r test for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 within 72 hours before the environmental sampling . measurements : extent of environmental surface contamination in ai ##irs of 30 co ##vid - 19 patients by pc ##r on environmental sw ##ab ##s . the particle size distribution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the air was measured using ni ##osh air sample ##rs . results : 245 surface samples were collected from 30 rooms of co ##vid - 19 patients , and air sampling was conducted in 3 rooms . 56 . 7 % of the rooms had at least one environmental surface contaminated , with 18 . 5 % of the toilet seats and toilet flush button being contaminated . high touch surface contamination was shown in ten ( 66 . 7 % ) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness , and three ( 20 % ) beyond the first week of illness ( p = 0 . 01 ##0 ) . air sampling of two co ##vid - 19 patients ( both day 5 of symptoms ) detected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pc ##r - positive particles of sizes > 4 μ ##m and 1 - 4 μ ##m . in a single subject at day 9 of symptoms , no sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pc ##r - positive particles were detected . limitations : viral culture results were not available to assess the via ##bility of the virus con ##tam ##inating the air and surface . conclusion : environmental contamination was detected in rooms with co ##vid - 19 patients in early stages of illness , but was significantly less after day 7 of disease . under ai ##ir conditions , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 respiratory particles can be detected at sizes 1 - 4 μ ##m and > 4 μ ##m in diameter in the air which warrant ##s further studies .  
there are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / hc ##ov - 19 in hub ##ei province that caused the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , including ( 1 ) the relationship of the new virus to the sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es , ( 2 ) the role of bats as a reservoir species , ( 3 ) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event , and ( 4 ) the role of rec ##om ##bina ##tion in viral emergence . here , we address these questions and find that the sar ##be ##co ##virus ##es - - the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - - exhibit frequent rec ##om ##bina ##tion , but the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 lineage itself is not a rec ##om ##bina ##nt of any viruses detected to date . in order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the diver ##gence events between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the bat sar ##be ##co ##virus reservoir , rec ##om ##bina ##nt regions of a 68 - genome sar ##be ##co ##virus alignment were removed with three independent methods . bay ##esian evolutionary rate and diver ##gence date estimates were consistent for all three rec ##om ##bina ##tion - free alignment ##s and robust to two different prior specifications based on hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and mer ##s - co ##v evolutionary rates . diver ##gence dates between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the bat sar ##be ##co ##virus reservoir were estimated as 1948 ( 95 % hp ##d : 1879 - 1999 ) , 1969 ( 95 % hp ##d : 1930 - 2000 ) , and 1982 ( 95 % hp ##d : 1948 - 2009 ) . despite intensified characterization of sar ##be ##co ##virus ##es since sar ##s , the lineage giving rise to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pang ##olin ##s . the occurrence of a third significant corona ##virus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the cause of the ongoing pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , a public health emergency of international concern declared by the world health organization ( who ) . an im ##mun ##o - inform ##atics approach along with comparative gen ##omic was applied to design a multi - ep ##ito ##pe - based peptide vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 combining the antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes of the s , m and e proteins . the tertiary structure was predicted , refined and valid ##ated using advanced bio ##in ##form ##atics tools . the candidate vaccine showed an average of ≥ 90 . 0 % world population coverage for different ethnic groups . molecular docking of the chi ##meric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors ( t ##lr ##3 and t ##lr ##4 ) predicted efficient binding . immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased i ##gm and secondary immune response with high levels of both i ##gg ##1 and i ##gg ##2 . it also increased the proliferation of t - help ##er cells and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t - cells along with the increased in ##f - γ and il - 2 cy ##tok ##ines . the cod ##on optimization and mrna secondary structure prediction revealed the chi ##mer ##a is suitable for high - level expression and cl ##oning . overall , the constructed rec ##om ##bina ##nt chi ##meric vaccine candidate demonstrated significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global threat , co ##vid - 19 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) causes the infectious disease co ##vid - 19 , which was first reported in wu ##han , china in december , 2019 . despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease , co ##vid - 19 has now spread to over 100 countries and caused a global pan ##de ##mic . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is thought to have originated in bats ; however , the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown . here , we investigated the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of fe ##rret ##s and animals in close contact with humans to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we found that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replicate ##s poorly in dogs , pigs , chickens , and ducks , but efficiently in fe ##rret ##s and cats . we found that the virus transmit ##s in cats via respiratory droplets . our study provides important insights into the animal reservoirs of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and animal management for co ##vid - 19 control .  
the ongoing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic demands rapid identification of im ##mun ##ogenic targets for the design of efficient vaccines and ser ##ological detection tools . in this report , using pools of overlapping linear peptide ##s and functional ass ##ays , we present two im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant regions on the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that were highly recognized by neutral ##izing antibodies in the sera of co ##vid - 19 con ##vale ##scent patients . one is highly specific to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and the other is a potential pan - corona ##virus target .  
background : co ##vid - 19 has become a worldwide pan ##de ##mic . it is caused by a novel corona ##virus named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with elusive origin . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect ##s mammalian cells by binding to ace ##2 , a trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein . therefore , the conservation of ace ##2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species , which are yet to be comprehensive ##ly investigated , may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . methods : we analyzed gene conservation of ace ##2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcript ##ome data ##set ##s from human and common mammalian species , including presumed hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other animals in close contact with humans . in order to enable comparisons across species and tissues , we used a unified pipeline to quan ##tify and normal ##ize ace ##2 expression levels . results : we first found high conservation of ace ##2 genes among common mammals at both dna and peptide levels , suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . next , we showed that high level of ace ##2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of co ##vid - 19 patients . furthermore , we observed that ace ##2 expressed in a species - specific manner in the mammals examined . notably , high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to humans . conclusions : through building the first atlas of ace ##2 expression in pets and livestock , we identified species and tissues susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , yielding novel insights into the viral transmission .  
understanding the molecular features that made sar ##s - co ##v - 2 a highly infectious virus is crucial for the development of targeted the ##ra ##pies and an effective vaccine . following the recent report of a fur ##in - like cleavage site ##1 , unique to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we characterized several additional residues positioned within the crown of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein under positive / divers ##ifying selection along the ancestral lineage of current pan ##de ##mic strains . residue v ##48 ##3 in near proximity to the ace ##2 binding domain , which may indeed affect the enhanced ability of currently circulating strains to in ##fect host cells . molecular dynamic simulations revealed long - range co ##var ##ian ##t movements with fur ##in cleavage , correlated with pre - fusion conform ##ation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein mono ##mer . residue t ##33 ##3 is hi ##nge of this movement that gives further advantage to bind cell receptors facilitating fusion and entry . evolutionary analysis revealed that current lineage is likely to have emerged from the reservoir after a rec ##om ##bina ##tion event between bat and pang ##olin ancestors . rec ##om ##bina ##tion impacted residues located in the binding receptor region of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that are identical to pang ##olin ancestor . interesting ##ly , several rec ##om ##bina ##tion hot ##sp ##ots were detected throughout the genome with the exception of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , which exhibits a cold ##sp ##ot in the n terminal region , likely the result of negative selection against further changes that may reduce its optimal fitness .  
sar ##s co ##v ##2 is a novel highly vi ##ru ##lent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ( ace ##2 ) . we contrasted the binding interactions between human ace ##2 and corona ##virus spike protein receptor binding domains ( rb ##ds ) from ( i ) sar ##s - co ##v ##2 , ( ii ) the related but less vi ##ru ##lent o ##c ##43 ( singapore co ##vid - 19 strain ) , and ( iii ) the 2002 epidemic - causing sar ##s co ##v ##1 . we find that the rb ##ds of the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 are highly opt ##imi ##zed to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ace ##2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogen ##ici ##ty . sar ##s co ##v ##2 rb ##ds form the most stable complex with ace ##2 ( 64 . 91 % , and 28 . 07 % higher binding scores than sar ##s co ##v ##1 and o ##c ##43 , respectively ) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the at ##r ##1 binding site . in fact , the spike protein rb ##ds from sar ##s - co ##v ##2 out - compete the ang ##iot ##ens ##in 2 receptor type i ( at ##r ##1 ) which is the native binding partner of ace ##2 by 64 % in terms of binding affinity ( quan ##ti ##fied using the rose ##tta scoring function ) . they accomplish this through strong electro ##static attachment ##s with every fourth residue on the n - terminus alpha - helix ( starting from ser ##19 to as ##n ##53 ) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible . these results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s co ##v ##2 and all ##ude to therapeutic mod ##ali ##ties by identifying and rank - ordering the ace ##2 residues involved in binding with the virus .  
abstract ##the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic is spreading rapidly , highlighting the urgent need for an efficient approach to rapidly develop therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we describe here the development of a ph ##age - displayed single - domain antibody library by graf ##ting naive cd ##rs into framework regions of an identified human ge ##rm ##line i ##gh ##v all ##ele . this enabled the isolation of high - affinity single - domain antibodies of fully human origin . the pan ##ning using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d and s ##1 as antigen ##s resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutral ##izing or non - neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d . these fully human single - domain antibodies bound specifically to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d with sub ##nan ##omo ##lar to low nano ##mo ##lar af ##fin ##ities . some of them were found to potent ##ly neutral ##ize pseudo ##type ##d and live virus , and therefore may represent promising candidates for prop ##hyl ##ax ##is and therapy of co ##vid - 19 . this study also reports unique im ##mun ##ogenic profile of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d compared to that of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , which may have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##phy ##log ##eno ##mic analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as available from publicly available rep ##osi ##tori ##es suggests the presence of 4 prevalent groups of viral ep ##iso ##mes ( super - clade ##s ) , which are mostly associated with outbreak ##s in distinct geographic locations ( china , usa and europe ) . while levels of gen ##omic variability between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s are limited , to our knowledge , it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super - clade ##s reflect ongoing adaptation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , or merely genetic drift and founder effects . here , we analyze more than 1100 complete , high quality sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequences , and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns / signatures in the genome ##s of the currently known major clade ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral ep ##iso ##mes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects , coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus . we observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hyper ##var ##ia ##bility of specific gen ##omic regions ( including the rd ##b domain of the spike protein ) , the more variable gen ##omic regions between extant sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ep ##iso ##mes correspond with the 3 ’ and 5 ’ ut ##rs , suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains . all in all , while - also in the light of the limited variability of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - this study cannot be con ##clusive , we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen .  
as the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic is rapidly progressing , the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical . a promising approach for vaccine development is to generate , through cod ##on pair de ##op ##ti ##mi ##zation , an at ##ten ##uated virus . this approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question , other than its genome sequence . therefore , it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data . we performed comprehensive in si ##lic ##o analyses of several features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 gen ##omic sequence ( e . g . , cod ##on usage , cod ##on pair usage , din ##uc ##le ##otide / junction din ##uc ##le ##otide usage , rna structure around the frames ##hi ##ft region ) in comparison with other members of the corona ##vir ##idae family of viruses , the overall human genome , and the transcript ##ome of specific human tissues such as lung , which are primarily targeted by the virus . our analysis identified the spike ( s ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins as promising targets for de ##op ##ti ##mi ##zation and suggests a road ##ma ##p for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccine development , which can be general ##iza ##ble to other viruses .  
abstract ##el ##uc ##ida ##ting anti ##vira ##l cd ##8 t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may shed light on the het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y of clinical outcomes and inform vaccine or therapeutic approaches . to facilitate the evaluation of anti ##vira ##l cd ##8 t cell responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we generated a publicly accessible database of ep ##ito ##pes predicted to bind any class i h ##la protein across the entire sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome . while a subset of ep ##ito ##pes from earlier beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , such as sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s ) , have been valid ##ated experimental ##ly , validation systems are often biased toward specific h ##la ha ##pl ##otype ##s ( notably h ##la - a * 02 : 01 ) that only account for a fraction of the ha ##pl ##otype ##s of individuals affected by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . to enable evaluation of ep ##ito ##pes across individuals with a variety of h ##la ha ##pl ##otype ##s , we computed the predicted binding af ##fin ##ities between 9 - mer peptide ##s derived from the ann ##ota ##ted sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pep ##ti ##dome across 9 , 360 m ##hc class i h ##la - a , - b , and - c all ##eles . there were 6 , 74 ##8 unique combinations of peptide ##s and h ##la all ##eles ( pm ##hc ##s ) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500 ##n ##m , including 1 , 103 unique peptide ##s and 1 , 02 ##2 h ##la all ##eles , spanning 11 ann ##ota ##ted super ##fa ##mi ##lies . these peptide ##s were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pep ##ti ##dome , including peptide ##s that have previously been valid ##ated experimental ##ly . we also show evidence that these previously valid ##ated ep ##ito ##pes may be relevant in other h ##la contexts . this complete data ##set is available publicly : gs : / / pic ##i - co ##vid ##19 - data - resources / m ##hc ##i / peptide _ predictions .  
we report a laboratory - based surveillance for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using mini ##pool ##s of respiratory samples submitted for routine diagnostic ##s . we tested a total of 70 mini ##pool ##s resembling 700 samples shortly before the ups ##urg ##e of cases in germany . we identified one sar ##s - co ##v - 2 positive patient . our approach proved its concept , is easily adapt ##able and resource - saving .  
background the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus threatens global public health . currently , neutral ##izing antibodies ( na ##bs ) versus this virus are expected to co ##rre ##late with recovery and protection of this disease . however , the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestation ##s in patients . methods plasma collected from 175 co ##vid - 19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudo ##type ##d - lent ##iv ##ira ##l - vector - based neutral ##ization ass ##ay . spike - binding antibody in plasma were determined by elisa using rb ##d , s ##1 , and s ##2 proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the levels and the time course of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific na ##bs and the spike - binding antibodies were monitored at the same time . findings sar ##s - co ##v - 2 na ##bs were unable to cross - reactive with sar ##s - co ##v virus . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific na ##bs were detected in patients from day 10 - 15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter . the ti ##ters of na ##b among these patients correlated with the spike - binding antibodies targeting s ##1 , rb ##d , and s ##2 regions . the ti ##ters of na ##bs were variable in different patients . elderly and middle - age patients had significantly higher plasma na ##b ti ##ters ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) and spike - binding antibodies ( p = 0 . 000 ##3 ) than young patients . notably , among these patients , there were ten patients whose na ##b ti ##ters were under the detect ##able level of our ass ##ay ( id ##50 : < 40 ) ; while in contrast , two patients , showed very high ti ##ters of na ##b , with id ##50 : 159 ##8 ##9 and 215 ##6 ##7 respectively . the na ##b ti ##ters were positive correlated with plasma cr ##p levels but negative correlated with the l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts of patients at the time of admission , indicating an association between humor ##al response and cellular immune response . interpretation the variations of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific na ##bs in recovered co ##vid - 19 patients may raise the concern about the role of na ##bs on disease progression . the correlation of na ##b ti ##ters with age , l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts , and blood cr ##p levels suggested that the inter ##play between virus and host immune response in corona ##virus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . furthermore , ti ##tra ##tion of na ##b
infection caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death . patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course . in this report we suggest that patients with systemic lu ##pus er ##ythe ##mat ##ous might be especially prone to severe co ##vid - 19 independent of their im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed state from lu ##pus treatment . specially , we provide evidence in lu ##pus to suggest h ##yp ##ome ##thy ##lation and over ##ex ##press ##ion of ace ##2 , which is located on the x chromosome and en ##codes a functional receptor for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . ox ##ida ##tive stress induced by viral infections ex ##ace ##rba ##tes the dna methyl ##ation defect in lu ##pus , possibly resulting in further ace ##2 h ##yp ##ome ##thy ##lation and enhanced vi ##rem ##ia . in addition , dem ##eth ##yla ##tion of inter ##fer ##on - regulated genes , n ##f ##κ ##b , and key cy ##tok ##ine genes in lu ##pus patients might ex ##ace ##rba ##te the immune response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and increase the likelihood of cy ##tok ##ine storm . these arguments suggest that inherent ep ##igen ##etic d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation in lu ##pus might facilitate viral entry , vi ##rem ##ia , and an excessive immune response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . further , maintaining disease re ##mission in lu ##pus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of dem ##eth ##yla ##tion and increased ox ##ida ##tive stress , which will ex ##ace ##rba ##te su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection during the current pan ##de ##mic . ep ##igen ##etic control of the ace ##2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in co ##vid - 19 .  
the recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) ex ##em ##pl ##ifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic ass ##ays to prompt public health actions . currently , several quantitative reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( q ##rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays are being used by clinical , research , and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus . however , it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable . our goal was to evaluate the prime ##r - probe sets used in four common diagnostic ass ##ays available on the world health organization ( who ) website . to facilitate this effort , we generated rna transcript ##s to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation . we then used these rna transcript standards , full - length sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna , and rna - spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine prime ##r - probe sets . we show that all prime ##r - probe sets can be used to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negative ##s and positive ##s with low amounts of virus . adding to this , many prime ##r - probe sets , including the n ##2 and n ##3 sets issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention , have background amp ##li ##fication with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - negative nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s , which may lead to inc ##on ##clusive results . our findings character ##ize the limitations of commonly used prime ##r - probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate ass ##ays for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the recent emergence of the pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 initiated a worldwide health crisis . the entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral spike protein to the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme - 2 ( ace ##2 ) , followed by its pri ##ming by the t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se , both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells . in the respiratory tract , these targets are ci ##lia ##ted cells . interesting ##ly , various reports indicate an association between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and an ##os ##mia , suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue , but that might also include the ol ##factory sensory ep ##ith ##eli ##um . we explored this possibility by generating rna - se ##q libraries from human ne ##uro ##ep ##ith ##eli ##um , in which we found significant expression of ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . to determine whether specific cell types of this che ##mos ##ens ##ory tissue may coe ##x ##press both of the virus entry genes , we analyzed a sc ##rna - se ##q data ##set . we determined that su ##sten ##ta ##cular cells , which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of ol ##factory sensory neurons , represents a prime candidate for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection via the nose , and possibly for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - induced an ##os ##mia .  
abstract ##the virus that causes co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has a large rna genome that en ##codes numerous proteins that might be targets for anti ##vira ##l drugs . some of these proteins , such as the rna - dependent rna polymers , he ##lica ##se and main pro ##tea ##se , are well conserved between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the original sar ##s virus , but several others are not . this study examines one of the most novel proteins encoded by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , a macro ##dom ##ain of non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 3 ( ns ##p ##3 ) . although 26 % of the amino acids in this sar ##s - co ##v - 2 macro ##dom ##ain differ from those seen in other corona - viruses , the protein retains the ability to bind ad ##p - rib ##ose , which is an important characteristic of beta corona ##virus ##es , and potential therapeutic target .  
abstract ##t ##wo notable features have been identified in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome : ( 1 ) the receptor binding domain of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; ( 2 ) a unique insertion of twelve nu ##cle ##otide or four amino acids ( pr ##ra ) at the s ##1 and s ##2 boundary . for the first feature , the similar rb ##d identified in sar ##s - like virus from pang ##olin suggests the rb ##d in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may already exist in animal host ( s ) before it transmitted into human . the left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at s ##1 / s ##2 boundary , which is uniquely identified in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in this study , we identified two variants from the first guangdong sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cell strain , with del ##eti ##on mutations on poly ##bas ##ic cleavage site ( pr ##rar ) and its flank sites . more extensive screening indicates the del ##eti ##on at the flank sites of pr ##rar could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains . these data indicate ( 1 ) the del ##eti ##on of q ##t ##q ##t ##n , at the flank of poly ##bas ##ic cleavage site , is likely benefit the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples ; ( 2 ) there could be a very efficient mechanism for del ##eti ##ng this region from viral genome as the variants losing 235 ##85 - 235 ##9 ##9 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage . the me ##chan ##istic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes ( or reverse ) that led to such gen ##omic changes in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 requires further work . nonetheless , this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution . the del ##eti ##on mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development .  
abstract ##the international spread of the novel , pathogen ##ic sar ##s - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) poses a global challenge on both healthcare and society . a multitude of research efforts worldwide aim at character ##izing the cellular factors involved in viral transmission in order to reveal therapeutic targets . for a full understanding of the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , the cell type - specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary . the key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is ang ##iot ##ens ##in i converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , and its expression has been reported in various human organs , in some cases with inconsistent or contradictory results . here , we aim to verify a reliable expression profile of ace ##2 in all major human tissues and cell types . based on string ##ently valid ##ated im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical analysis and high - through ##put mrna sequencing from several data ##set ##s , we found that ace ##2 expression is mainly localized to micro ##vill ##i of the int ##estinal tract and renal pro ##xi ##mal tub ##ules , gall ##bla ##dder ep ##ith ##eli ##um , test ##icular ser ##to ##li cells and ley ##di ##g cells , gland ##ular cells of seminal ve ##sic ##le and card ##iom ##yo ##cytes . the expression in several other previously reported locations , including al ##ve ##olar type ii ( at ##2 ) cells , could not be confirmed . furthermore , ace ##2 expression was absent in the at ##2 lung car ##cino ##ma cell line a ##54 ##9 , often used as a model for viral replication studies . our analysis suggests that the expression of ace ##2 in the human respiratory system appears to be limited , and the expression of the receptor in lung or respiratory ep ##ith ##elia on the protein level is yet to be confirmed . this raises questions regarding the role of ace ##2 for infection of human lungs and highlights the need to further explore the route of transmission during sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) ( previously called 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , a disease recently declared a global public health emergency by the world health organization . at the moment there is no available drug ( s ) and vaccine ( s ) for the treatment or prevention of co ##vid - 19 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) and main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) are crucial deter ##mina ##nts in the virus infectious process and have been recognized as key targets for therapeutic ##s designs . in the present in si ##lic ##o study , a library of 22 ph ##yt ##oche ##mic ##als with anti ##vira ##l activity obtained from pub ##che ##m database was screened for activity against 6 ##lu ##7 and 6 ##vs ##b with the p ##yr ##x software . six lead compounds with binding energies within the range of - 9 to - 9 . 6 kc ##al / mo ##l were selected for molecular docking analyses against 6 ##lu ##7 . swiss ##ad ##met and mo ##lins ##piration che ##min ##form ##atics for cl ##og ##p ( mean range of 0 . 77 - 8 . 72 ) of the lead compounds showed no correlation observed between lip ##op ##hil ##ici ##ty and interaction with receptors and all the compounds except for bai ##cal ##in exhibited drug - like properties based on lip ##inski and ve ##ber filter . the ad ##met profile showed that lead compounds lack he ##pa ##to ##to ##xi ##city and mu ##tage ##nic ##ity effects while they show variable im ##mun ##oto ##xi ##city , car ##cino ##genic ##ity and cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city . the compounds sc ##op ##od ##uli ##c acid and dam ##mare ##no ##lic acid showed the best - fit value of activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein 6 ##vs ##b and main pro ##tea ##se mp ##ro 6 ##lu ##7 targets , respectively . our data suggest si ##lib ##ini ##n a rep ##ur ##po ##sing candidate drug may have multi ##tar ##get activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . so further in vitro and in vivo evaluation ##s are recommended .  
abstract ##re ##cent ##ly a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) emerged from wu ##han , china and has infected more than 57 ##100 ##0 people leading to more than 260 ##00 deaths . since sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequences show similarity with those of sar ##s , we sought to analyze all the available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s based on the insights obtained from sar ##s genome specifically focusing on non - coding rna ##s . here , results are presented from the dual approach i . e identifying host encoded mir ##nas that might regulate viral pathogen ##esis as well as identifying viral encoded mir ##nas that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogen ##esis . analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded mir ##nas that could target the genome of both the viruses ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s reference genome ) . interesting ##ly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host mir ##nas that could target sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome as compared to the sar ##s reference genome . results from second approach involving sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s reference genome identified a set of virus encoded mir ##nas which might regulate host signaling pathways . our analysis further identified a similar “ ga ” rich motif in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogen ##esis during severe sar ##s infections . hence , we successfully identified human and virus encoded mir ##nas that might regulate pathogen ##esis of both these corona ##virus ##es and the fact that more number of host mir ##nas could target sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogen ##esis in healthy individuals . we identified non - coding sequences in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s that were earlier reported to contribute towards sar ##s pathology . the study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new anti ##vira ##ls .  
summary ##her ##e we propose a va ##cci ##nation strategy for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 based on identification of both highly conserved regions of the virus and newly acquired adaptations that are presented by m ##hc class i and ii across the vast majority of the population , are highly di ##ssi ##mi ##lar from the human pro ##te ##ome , and are predicted b cell ep ##ito ##pes . we present 65 peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be rapidly tested in dna , mrna , or synthetic peptide construct ##s . these include ep ##ito ##pes that are contained within evolution ##ari ##ly diver ##gent regions of the spike protein reported to increase in ##fect ##ivity through increased binding to the ace ##2 receptor , and within a novel fur ##in cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion . this va ##cci ##nation strategy specifically targets unique vu ##ln ##era ##bilities of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population .  
abstract ##the ongoing corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person - to - person transmission and the current lack of effective anti ##vira ##l therapy . however , the exact molecular mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pathogen ##esis remain largely unknown . we exploited an integrated pro ##te ##omics approach to systematically investigate intra - viral and virus - host interact ##ome ##s for the identification of un ##real ##ized sar ##s - co ##v - 2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) isolated from co ##vid - 19 patients . using this approach , we el ##uc ##ida ##ted 251 host proteins targeted by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly per ##tur ##bed in co ##vid - 19 derived p ##bm ##cs . from the interact ##ome , we further identified that non - structural protein ns ##p ##9 and ns ##p ##10 interact with nk ##rf , a n ##f - к ##b rep ##ress ##or , and may pre ##ci ##pit ##ate the strong il - 8 / il - 6 mediated che ##mot ##ax ##is of ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s and over ##ex ##uber ##ant host inflammatory response observed in co ##vid - 19 patients . our int ##eg ##rative study not only presents a systematic examination of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - induced per ##tur ##bation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease et ##iology , but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which sar ##s - co ##v - 2 triggers cy ##tok ##ine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention .  
in 2019 , a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was first discovered in wu ##han , hub ##ei , china , causing severe respiratory disease in humans , and has been identified as a public health emergency of international concern . with the spread of the virus , there are more and more false negative cases of rt - pc ##r nuclei ##c acid detection in the early stage of potential infection . in this paper , we collected the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological history , clinical manifestation ##s , outcomes , laboratory results and images of a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 carrier with no significant past medical history . the patient was qu ##aran ##tine ##d because of her colleague had been diagnosed . after the onset of clinical symptoms , chest ct results showed patch ##y ground - glass op ##ac ##ity ( g ##go ) in her lungs , but it took a total of nine nuclei ##c acid tests to confirm the diagnosis , among which the first eight rt - pc ##r results were negative or single - target positive . in addition to coughing up ph ##leg ##m during her stay in the hospital , she did not develop chill ##s , fever , abdominal pain , dia ##rr ##hea and other clinical symptoms . since initial anti ##vira ##l treatment , the lung lesions were absorbed . but the sp ##ut ##um nuclei ##c acid test was still positive . in combination with anti ##vira ##l and immune therapy , the patient tested negative for the virus . notably , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples ( sp ##ut ##um ) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period . this is a confirmed case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection with common symptoms , and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negative ##s , suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
co ##vid - 19 is a global pan ##de ##mic with high in ##fect ##ivity and pathogen ##ici ##ty , accounting for tens of thousands of deaths worldwide . recent studies have found that the pathogen of co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , shares the same cell receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ii ( ace ##2 ) with sar ##s - co ##v . the path ##ological investigation of co ##vid - 19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis . however , how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined . here , we performed an un ##bia ##sed evaluation of cell - type specific expression of ace ##2 in healthy and fi ##bro ##tic lungs , as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts , using published single - cell rna - se ##q data . we found that ace ##2 expression in fi ##bro ##tic lungs mainly locate ##s in arterial vascular cells , which might provide the route for blood ##stream spreading of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ace ##2 - expressing card ##iom ##yo ##cytes , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might attack card ##iom ##yo ##cytes through the blood ##stream in patients with heart failure . moreover , ace ##2 was highly expressed in cells infected by rs ##v or mer ##s - co ##v and in mice treated by lp ##s . our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis , heart failure , and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might attack other organs by getting into the blood ##stream . this work provides new insights into sar ##s - co ##v - 2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications .  
the outbreak of sar ##s co ##v - 2 has caused ever increasing attention and public panic all over the world . currently , there is no specific treatment against the sar ##s co ##v - 2 . therefore , identifying effective anti ##vira ##l agents to combat the disease is urgently needed . previous studies found that indo ##met ##ha ##cin has the ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated dna and rna viruses , including sar ##s - co ##v . we found that indo ##met ##ha ##cin has a directly and potent ##ly anti ##vira ##l activity against the sar ##s co ##v - 2 pseudo ##virus . in canine corona ##virus - infected dogs , recovery occurred significantly sooner with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic treatment + oral indo ##met ##ha ##cin ( 1 mg / kg body weight ) daily treatments than with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic treatment + rib ##avi ##rin ( 10 - 15 mg / kg body weight ) daily treatments ( p = 0 . 00 ##31 ) , but was not significantly different from that with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic treatment + anti - canine corona ##virus serum + canine hem ##og ##lo ##bin + canine blood im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin + inter ##fer ##on treatments ( p = 0 . 77 ##8 ##4 ) .

abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) which is an infectious disease that spread throughout the world and was declared as a pan ##de ##mic by the world health organization ( who ) . in the present study , we analyzed genome - wide cod ##on usage patterns in 13 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s from different geo - locations ( countries ) by utilizing different cub measurements . nu ##cle ##otide and di - nu ##cle ##otide compositions displayed bias toward a / u content in all cod ##on positions and cpu - ended cod ##ons preference , respectively . relative synonymous cod ##on usage ( rs ##cu ) analysis revealed 8 common put ##ative preferred cod ##ons among all the 13 isolate ##s . interesting ##ly , all of the latter cod ##ons are a / u - ended ( u - ended : 7 , a - ended : 1 ) . cluster analysis ( based on rs ##cu values ) was performed and showed comparable results to the phylogenetic analysis ( based on their whole genome sequences ) indicating that the cub pattern may reflect the evolutionary relationship between the tested isolate ##s . to investigate the force ( mutation and / or selection ) influencing the pattern of cub in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 coding sequences , we employed the following ; ( i ) . effective number of cod ##ons ( en ##c ) , ( ii ) . en ##c - g ##c ##3 plot , ( iii ) . neutrality plot , and ( iv ) cod ##on adaptation index ( cai ) . according to their results , natural selection and / or other factors ( not investigated in this study ) may be the dominant force driving sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cub . it is also worth mentioning that , by using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues as a reference set , some viral genes such as nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein , or ##f ##7 ##a protein , and surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein had high cai values which may indicate for selection force acting on their cod ##on usage , as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system . the outcome of our study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses , and the interactions with their host . also , it may aid in vaccine design strategies .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has rapidly become a pan ##de ##mic worldwide ; therefore , an effective vaccine is urgently needed . recently , messenger rna ##s ( mrna ##s ) have emerged as a promising platform for va ##cci ##nation . here , we systematically investigated the un ##tra ##ns ##lated regions ( ut ##rs ) of mrna ##s in order to enhance protein production . through a comprehensive analysis of end ##ogen ##ous gene expression and de novo design of ut ##rs , we identified the optimal combination of 5 ′ and 3 ′ ut ##r , termed as nasa ##r , which was five to ten - fold more efficient than the tested end ##ogen ##ous ut ##rs . more importantly , nasa ##r mrna ##s delivered by lip ##id - derived nano ##par ##tic ##les showed dramatic expression of potential sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antigen ##s both in vitro and in vivo . these nasa ##r mrna ##s merit further development as alternative sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccines .  
abstract ##the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic has been growing exponential ##ly , affecting nearly 900 thousand people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide . a pl ##eth ##ora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published , in scientific journals as well as through non - peer reviewed channels , to investigate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genetic het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y and spat ##iot ##em ##por ##al dissemination . we examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and ph ##yl ##oge ##ographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases . although number of - available full - genome ##s is growing daily , and the full data ##set contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships , country - specific sar ##s - co ##v - 2 data ##set ##s still present severe limitations . studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best , or hypothesis generating . hence the need for continuing concert ##ed efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic . significance statement ##al ##th ##ough genome sequences of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are growing daily and contain sufficient phylogenetic information , country - specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution .  
abstract ##the novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is highly con ##tag ##ious and can cause serious acute respiratory illness syndrome ##s , often fatal , called co ##vid - 19 . it is an urgent priority to better understand sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of prop ##hyl ##actic vaccines and therapeutic ##s that are very important to people health and socio ##economic stability around the world . the surface corona ##virus spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is considered as a key factor in host specific ##ity because it media ##tes infection by receptor - recognition and membrane fusion . here the analysis of co ##v - 2 s protein revealed in s ##1 ##su ##bu ##ni ##t a b ##56 - binding l ##xx ##ix ##e - like motif that could recruit the host protein ph ##os ##pha ##tase 2a ( pp ##2 ##a ) . this motif is absent in sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . pp ##2 ##a is a major family of ser ##ine / th ##re ##oni ##ne ph ##os ##pha ##tase ##s in eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cells . ph ##os ##pha ##tase ##s and kinase ##s are big players in the regulation of pro - inflammatory responses during pathogen ##ic infections . moreover , studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target pp ##2 ##a in order to manipulate host ’ s anti ##vira ##l responses . the latest studies have indicated that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host . therefore , by controlling acute inflammation ; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host . among efforts to fight co ##vid - 19 , the interaction between l ##xx ##ix ##e - like motif and pp ##2 ##a - b ##56 - binding pocket could be a target for the development of a bio ##active peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes .  
summary ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was first reported in wu ##han , china , and rapidly spread worldwide . previous studies suggested cat could be a potential susceptible animal of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we investigated the infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in cats by detecting specific serum antibodies . a co ##hort of serum samples were collected from cats in wu ##han , including 102 sampled after co ##vid - 19 outbreak , and 39 prior to the outbreak . 15 of 102 ( 14 . 7 % ) cat sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by indirect enzyme linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . among the positive samples , 11 had sar ##s - co ##v - 2 neutral ##izing antibodies with a ti ##ter ranging from 1 / 20 to 1 / 108 ##0 . no ser ##ological cross - react ##ivity was detected between the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and type i or ii fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ( fi ##p ##v ) . our data demonstrates that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has infected cat population in wu ##han during the outbreak .  
detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections to date has relied on rt - pc ##r testing . however , a failure to identify early cases imported to a country , bottle ##neck ##s in rt - pc ##r testing , and the existence of infections which are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , sub - clinical , or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under - counting of the true prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we show how publicly available cdc influenza - like illness ( il ##i ) out ##patient surveillance data can be rep ##ur ##posed to estimate the detection rate of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections . we find a surge of non - influenza il ##i above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with co ##vid case counts across states . by quan ##tify ##ing the number of excess il ##i patients in march relative to previous years and comparing excess il ##i to confirmed co ##vid case counts , we estimate the sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic case detection rate of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the us to be 1 / 100 to 1 / 1000 . this corresponds to approximately 10 million presumed sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients across the us during the week starting on march 15 , 2020 . combining excess il ##i counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the us , we also show that the early epidemic in the us was unlikely to be doubling slower than every three days . together these results suggest a conceptual model for the co ##vid epidemic in the us in which rapid spread across the us are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild - to - moderate clinical symptoms . we emphasize the importance of testing these findings with ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce data , and discuss the broader potential to rep ##ur ##pose out ##patient time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases .  
ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been identified as a critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . this has led to extensive speculation on the role of ace ##2 in disease severity , and in particular , whether variation in its expression can explain higher mortality in older individuals . we examine this question in mouse lung and show that 24 - month old mice have significantly reduced ace ##2 mrna expression relative to 3 - month old mice . the differences appear to be localized to ci ##lia ##ted cells .  
abstract ##the recent outbreak by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and claimed / infected a large number of lives . closely resembling with sar ##s co ##v , the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spread ##ability , vi ##ru ##lence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations . the viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is very likely to interact with host ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) and transmit ##s its genetic materials and hi ##jack ##s host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation . few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ace ##2 block ##er or virus - receptor inhibitor within this short period of time . here , attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and va ##cci ##nation strategies with a comparison of spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s among sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we verified their structure quality ( swiss - model , ph ##yre ##2 , p ##ym ##ol ) topology ( prof ##un ##c ) , motifs ( me ##me suite , g ##lam ##2 ##scan ) , gene onto ##logy based conserved domain ( inter ##pro database ) and screened several ep ##ito ##pes ( sv ##mt ##rip ) of sar ##s co ##v - 2 based on their energetic ##s , ic ##50 and antigen ##ici ##ty with regard to their possible g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion and m ##hc / para ##top ##ic binding ( va ##xi ##gen v ##2 . 0 , hawk ##dock , z ##dock server ) effects . we screened here few pairs of spike protein ep ##ito ##pic regions and selected their energetic , ic ##50 , m ##hc ii react ##ivity and found some of those to be very good target for va ##cci ##nation . a possible role of g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion on ep ##ito ##pic region showed profound effects on ep ##ito ##pic recognition . the present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable va ##cci ##nation regime ##n against sar ##s co ##v - 2 .  
the ongoing historic outbreak of co ##vid - 19 not only constitutes a global public health crisis , but also carries a devastating social and economic impact . the disease is caused by a newly identified corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . there is an urgent need to identify anti ##vira ##ls to curt ##ail the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . here ##in , we report the remarkable sensitivity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to rec ##om ##bina ##nt human inter ##fer ##ons α and β ( if ##n ##α / β ) . treatment with if ##n - α at a concentration of 50 international units ( i ##u ) per mill ##ili ##ter drastically reduces viral ti ##ters by 3 . 4 log or over 4 log , respectively , in ve ##ro cells . the ec ##50 of if ##n - α and if ##n - β treatment is 1 . 35 i ##u / ml and 0 . 76 i ##u / ml , respectively , in ve ##ro cells . these results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogen ##ic viruses , including sar ##s - co ##v . overall , our results demonstrate the potent efficacy of human type i if ##n in suppress ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , a finding which could inform future treatment options for co ##vid - 19 .  
in the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , hospitals are stretched beyond capacity . there are widespread reports of d ##wind ##ling supplies of personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) , which are paramount to protect front ##line medical / nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus . we carried out a rapid review to sum ##mar ##ize the existing evidence on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 survivors ##hip and methods to di ##sin ##fect pp ##e gear , particularly n ##9 ##5 filtering face ##piece res ##pi ##rator ##s ( ff ##r ) . in the absence of data on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we focused on the sister virus sar ##s - co ##v - 1 . we propose a two - step di ##sin ##fect ##ion process , which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . this di ##sin ##fect ##ion protocol is based on an initial storage of pp ##e for ≥ ##4 days , followed by ultraviolet light ( uv ##c ) , dry heat treatment , or chemical di ##sin ##fect ##ion . importantly , each of the two steps is based on independent di ##sin ##fect ##ion mechanisms , so that our proposed protocol is a multi ##pl ##icative system , maxim ##ising the efficacy of our di ##sin ##fect ##ion process . this method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings , while testing of each method is undertaken , increasing the front ##line supply of pp ##e , and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced .  
following its emergence in wu ##han , china , in late november or early december 2019 , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world . on march 11 , 2020 , the world health organization declared corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) a pan ##de ##mic . genome sequencing of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains allows for the reconstruction of transmission history connecting these infections . here , we analyze 34 ##6 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s from samples collected between 20 february and 15 march 2020 from infected patients in washington state , usa . we found that the large majority of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late january or early february 2020 and subsequent local spread , strongly suggesting cryptic spread of co ##vid - 19 during the months of january and february 2020 , before active community surveillance was implemented . we estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 january and 9 february 2020 . from gen ##omic data , we estimate an exponential doubling between 2 . 4 and 5 . 1 days . these results highlight the need for large - scale community surveillance for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 introductions and spread and the power of pathogen gen ##omics to inform ep ##ide ##mi ##ological understanding .  
the discovery of ep ##ito ##pes is helpful to the development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccine . the sequences of the surface protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its pro ##xi ##mal sequences were obtained by blast , the sequences of the whole genome of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were obtained from the gen ##bank . based on the nc ##bi reference sequence : nc _ 04 ##55 ##12 . 2 , the conform ##ation ##al and linear b cell ep ##ito ##pes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods . furthermore , the conservation of the ep ##ito ##pes , the adapt ##ability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed . 7 ep ##ito ##pes were predicted , including 5 linear ep ##ito ##pes and 2 conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes , one of the linear and one of the conform ##ation ##al were coincide . the ep ##ito ##pe d mu ##tated easily , but the other ep ##ito ##pes were very conservative and the ep ##ito ##pe c was the most conservative . it is worth mentioning that all of the 6 dominated ep ##ito ##pes were absolutely conservative in nearly 1000 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s , and they deserved further study . the findings would facilitate the vaccine development , had the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease , but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of corona ##virus .  
summary ##a novel corona ##virus , named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , emerged in 2019 from hub ##ei region in china and rapidly spread worldwide . as no approved therapeutic ##s exists to treat co ##vid - 19 , the disease associated to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics . rep ##ur ##po ##sing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time consuming stages of drug development . in this study , we screened the pre ##st ##wick chemical library ##® composed of 1 , 520 approved drugs in an infected cell - based ass ##ay . 90 compounds were identified . the robust ##ness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs , such as ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e derivatives and pro ##tea ##se inhibitors , already in clinical trials . the hits were sorted according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect , then ec ##50 and cc ##50 were determined for a subset of compounds . several drugs , such as az ##ith ##rom ##y ##cine , op ##ip ##ram ##ol , qui ##ni ##dine or om ##ep ##raz ##ol present anti ##vira ##l pot ##ency with 2 < ec ##50 < 20 ##µ ##m . by providing new information on molecules inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication in vitro , this study could contribute to the short - term rep ##ur ##po ##sing of drugs against co ##vid - 19 .  
there is an urgent necessity of effective medication against sar ##s co ##v - 2 , which is producing the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic across the world . its main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) represents an attractive ph ##arm ##aco ##logical target due to its involvement in essential viral functions . the crystal structure of free mp ##ro shows a large structural resemblance with the main pro ##tea ##se of co ##v - 1 . here we report that co ##v - 2 mp ##ro is however 300 % more sensitive than co ##v - 1 mp ##ro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long - range interactions . the largest sensitivity of mp ##ro to structural per ##tur ##bation ##s is located exactly around the catalytic site cy ##st - 145 , and coincide ##s with the binding site of several of its inhibitors . these findings , based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network , may help in designing potent inhibitors of co ##v - 2 mp ##ro .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 is a novel corona ##virus currently causing a pan ##de ##mic . we show that the majority of amino acid positions , which differ between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the closely related sar ##s - co ##v , are differential ##ly conserved suggesting differences in biological behaviour . in agreement , novel cell culture models revealed differences between the tr ##op ##ism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v . moreover , cellular ace ##2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor ) and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ( enables virus entry via s protein cleavage ) levels did not re ##lia ##bly indicate cell su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles . thus , only drug testing using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 re ##lia ##bly identifies therapy candidates . therapeutic concentrations of the approved pro ##tea ##se inhibitor apr ##ot ##ini ##n displayed anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 activity . the efficacy of apr ##ot ##ini ##n and of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( currently under clinical investigation against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor om ##ep ##raz ##ole ( apr ##ot ##ini ##n 2 . 7 - fold , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir 10 - fold ) . hence , our study has also identified anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in patients .  
summary ##ra ##pid ##ly responding to novel pathogen ##s , such as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , represents an extremely challenging and complex endeavor . numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mit ##igate the catastrophic effects of co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic are underway , yet an e ##ffi ##ca ##cious counter ##me ##as ##ure is still not available . to support these global research efforts , we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning , bio ##in ##form ##atics , and super ##com ##put ##ing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) . in 22 days , using just the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequence and previously published neutral ##izing antibody structures for sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d . as a first step in this process , we predicted ( and publicly released ) structures of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein using homo ##logy - based structural modeling . the predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted rb ##d region when compared to experimental ##ly derived structures published weeks later . next we used our in si ##lic ##o design platform to it ##erative ##ly propose mutations to sar ##s - co ##v - 1 neutral ##izing antibodies ( known not to bind sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) to enable and opt ##imi ##ze binding within the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . starting from a calculated baseline free energy of − ##48 . 1 kc ##al / mo ##l ( ± 8 . 3 ) , our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d with free energies as low as − ##8 ##2 . 0 kc ##al / mole . the baseline sar ##s - co ##v - 1 antibody in complex with the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 rb ##d has a calculated interaction energy of − ##52 . 2 kc ##al / mole and neutral ##izes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ace ##2 receptor . these results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d and potentially neutral ##ize the virus . additionally , our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody develop ##ability metric ##s . these antibody designs are being expressed and experimental ##ly tested for binding to co ##vid - 19 viral proteins , which will provide in ##val ##ua ##ble feedback to further improve the machine learning – driven designs . this technical report is a high - level description of that effort ; the supplementary materials includes the homo ##logy - based
importance the united states is experiencing an acute shortage of re ##age ##nts important for performance of ass ##ays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 in clinical specimens . objective to determine whether saving in re ##age ##nts for detection of sar ##s co ##v - 2 can be accomplished using the optimal parameters for group testing of poole ##d specimens in a public health laboratory . design the most efficient specimen pool size was determined using a web - based application . parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were : prevalence rate of 5 % , a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 rna copies per micro ##lite ##r , sensitivity and specific ##ity of 100 % , two - stage pool ##ing algorithm , and a range of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples . experimental pools were created using 50 micro ##lite ##r from each confirmed nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al positive patient specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens ( 50 micro ##lite ##r each ) for a total volume of 250 micro ##lite ##r . viral rna was then extracted from each pool and subsequently tested with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r ass ##ay that was developed by the cdc and used according to the instructions of manufacturer . setting studies were conducted in the nebraska public health laboratory with samples collected from individual patients throughout the state . participants a total of 21 sar ##s co ##v - 2 confirmed positive samples and 84 sar ##s co ##v - 2 confirmed negative samples were used to create 21 pools . the positive specimens were selected for ct values indicating a relatively low amount of viral rna . the method was then tested on an un ##sel ##ect ##ed group of 60 community nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al specimens . results following extraction and rt - pc ##r amp ##li ##fication , all 21 pools were characterized as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna detected with ct values within - 1 and 5 ct of the original samples . the analysis of 60 community specimens , grouped in 12 - pools , determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two detected specimens among the 60 tested . this was accomplished with a total of 22 reactions . conclusion and relevance group testing may result in the saving of re ##age ##nts and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69 % when the positive laboratory test rate is 10 % or less .  
given the high need and the absence of specific anti ##vira ##ls for treatment of co ##vid - 19 ( the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus - 2 [ sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ] ) , human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) pro ##tea ##se inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives . pre ##z ##co ##bi ##x / re ##zo ##ls ##ta is a fixed - dose combination of 800 mg of the hiv pro ##tea ##se inhibitor dar ##una ##vir ( dr ##v ) and 150 mg co ##bic ##ista ##t , a cy ##p ##3 ##a ##4 inhibitor , which is indicated in combination with other anti ##ret ##rov ##ira ##l agents for the treatment of hiv infection . there are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of dr ##v / co ##bic ##ista ##t for treatment of co ##vid - 19 . the in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity of dar ##una ##vir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was assessed . dr ##v showed no activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at clinical ##ly relevant concentrations ( ec ##50 > 100 μ ##m ) . re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , used as a positive control , showed potent anti ##vira ##l activity ( ec ##50 = 0 . 38 μ ##m ) . overall , the data do not support the use of dr ##v for treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
preliminary evidence suggests that climate may mod ##ulate the transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pan ##de ##mic trajectory , given high su ##sc ##ept ##ibility is a core driver . here , we use a climate - dependent epidemic model to simulate the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic probing different scenarios of climate - dependence based on known corona ##virus biology . we find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections , during the pan ##de ##mic stage of an emerging pathogen such as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 climate may drive only modest changes to pan ##de ##mic size and duration . our results suggest that , in the absence of effective control measures , significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid ( warmer ) climates , ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of the climate - dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pan ##de ##mic growth .  
abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of the ongoing pan ##de ##mic of 2019 co ##v disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , which is already responsible for far more deaths than were reported during the previous public health emergencies of international concern provoked by two related pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) from 2002 and 2012 . the identification of any clinical ##ly approved drug that could be rep ##ur ##posed to combat co ##vid - 19 would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life - saving procedures to complement social di ##stan ##cing and isolation protocols . the major pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is considered a promising target for drug interventions , based on results from related co ##vs with lo ##pina ##vir ( lp ##v ) an hiv pro ##tea ##se inhibitor , that that can inhibit the mp ##ro of 2002 sar ##s - co ##v . however , limited evidence exists for other clinical ##ly approved anti - retro ##vira ##l pro ##tea ##se inhibitors that may bind more efficiently to mp ##ro from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and block its replication . of high interest is ata ##zan ##avi ##r ( atv ) due to its documented bio ##ava ##ila ##bility within the respiratory tract , which motivated our evaluation on its ability to imp ##air sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication through a series of in vitro experiments . a molecular dynamic analysis showed that atv could dock in the active site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mp ##ro with greater strength than lp ##v and occupied the substrate cl ##eft on the active side of the pro ##tea ##se throughout the entire molecular dynamic analysis . in a cell - free pro ##tea ##se ass ##ay , atv was determined to block mp ##ro activity at a concentration of 10 μ ##m . next , a series of ass ##ays with in vitro models of virus infection / replication ##s were performed using three cell types , ve ##ro cells , a human pulmonary ep ##ith ##elial cell line and primary human mono ##cytes , which confirmed that atv could inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication , alone or in combination with ri ##ton ##avi ##r ( rt ##v ) . in addition , the virus - induced levels of il - 6 and tn ##f - α were reduced in the presence of these drugs , which performed better than ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , a compound recognized for its anti - viral and anti - inflammatory activities . together , our data strongly suggest that atv and atv / rt ##v should be considered among the candidate rep ##ur ##posed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against co ##vid - 19 .  
the recent emerged sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may first transmit to intermediate animal host from bats before the spread to humans . the receptor recognition of ace ##2 protein by sar ##s - co ##vs or bat - originated corona ##virus ##es is one of the most important deter ##mina ##nt factors for the cross - species transmission and human - to - human transmission . to explore the hypothesis of possible intermediate animal host , we employed molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation to examine the binding of bat corona ##virus with ace ##2 proteins of 47 representing animal species collected from public databases . our results suggest that intermediate animal host may exist for the zoo ##not ##ic transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . furthermore , we found that tree sh ##rew and fe ##rret may be two put ##ative intermediate hosts for the zoo ##not ##ic spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . collectively , the continuous surveillance of pneumonia in human and suspicious animal hosts are crucial to control the zoo ##not ##ic transmission events caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
pan ##de ##mics , even more than other scientific questions , require swift integration of knowledge and id ##ent ##ifiers . in a setting where there is a large number of loosely connected projects and initiatives , we need a common ground , also known as a commons . wi ##ki ##da ##ta , a public knowledge graph aligned with wikipedia , is such a commons , but wi ##ki ##da ##ta may not always have the right sc ##hema for the urgent questions . in this paper , we address this problem by showing how a data sc ##hema required for the integration can be modelled with entity sc ##hema ##s represented by shape expressions . as a telling example , we describe the process of align ##ing resources on the gen ##omics of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus and related viruses as well as how shape expressions can be defined for wi ##ki ##da ##ta helping others studying the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . how this model can be used to make data between various resources inter ##oper ##able , is demonstrated by integrating data from nc ##bi taxonomy , nc ##bi genes , un ##ip ##rot , and wi ##ki ##path ##ways . based on that model , a set of automated applications or bot ##s were written for regular updates of these sources in wi ##ki ##da ##ta and added to a platform for automatically running these updates . although this work ##flow is developed and applied in the context of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic , it was also applied to other human corona ##virus ##es ( mer ##s , sar ##s , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , human corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 , human corona ##virus 229 ##e , human corona ##virus hk ##u ##1 , human corona ##virus o ##c ##4 ) to demonstrate its broader app ##lica ##bility .  
abstract ##a new beta ##cor ##ona ##virus named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy . a promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutic ##s treatments of the new disease named co ##vid - 19 is the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . by constant - ph monte carlo simulations and the proceed ##p ##ka method , we have mapped the electro ##static ep ##ito ##pes for four mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) on both sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and the new sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) proteins . we also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the s rb ##d proteins from both sar ##s viruses binds to ace ##2 with similar af ##fin ##ities . however , the affinity between the s rb ##d protein from the new sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and ace ##2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complex ##ed with sar ##s - co ##v - 1 . based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates , we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes , their clinical aspects , the implications for drug developments , and suggest structural modifications on the cr ##30 ##22 antibody that would improve its binding af ##fin ##ities for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 poses an immediate , urgent and major threat to public health across the globe . here we report an in - depth molecular analysis to rec ##ons ##truct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other corona ##virus ##es that are severe human pathogen ##s . using integrated comparative gen ##omics and machine learning techniques , we identify key gen ##omic features that differentiate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the viruses behind the two previous corona ##virus outbreak ##s , sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , from less pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es . the identified features could be crucial elements of corona ##virus pathogen ##ici ##ty and possible targets for diagnostic ##s , pro ##gno ##stic ##ation and interventions .  
viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans . given the recent and rapid emergence of pan ##de ##mic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , the cause of co ##vid - 19 disease , viral protein variants have attracted research interest . however , little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts . human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as hiv infection and malaria in ##fest ##ation . the fact that the human ace ##2 protein is encoded on the x chromosome means that males who carry rare ace ##2 coding variants will express those variants in all ace ##2 - expressing cells , whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early x - ina ##ct ##ivation events . this sex - based difference in ace ##2 expression has unique implications for ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection to co ##vid - 19 . here we present theoretical modelling of rare ace ##2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human super ##pop ##ulation ##s and sub ##pop ##ulation ##s , and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ace ##2 to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein exist in people . though the rs ##46 ##46 ##11 ##6 ( p . l ##ys ##26 ##ar ##g ) all ##ele is found in 1 in 70 ash ##ken ##azi jewish males , and in 1 in 172 non - finnish european males , this all ##ele is found at higher frequencies in females . furthermore , the class of miss ##ense ace ##2 all ##eles predicted to affect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binding are found in aggregate among 1 . 43 % and 2 . 16 % of ash ##ken ##azi males and females , respectively , as well as in 0 . 58 % and 1 . 24 % of european males and females outside of finland . these all ##eles are rare ##r in other population groups , and almost absent from east asian ##s gen ##otype ##d to date . though we are aware that full genome - wide and ex ##ome - wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 fully , we argue on the basis of strong prior pro ##ba ##bilities that gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of this class of all ##eles is justified in cases of at ##yp ##ical sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diseases , such as as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic super - spread ##ers ( if any are identified ) , and in neon ##atal / pa ##ed ##ia ##tric - onset co ##vid - 19 disease . even relatively rare su ##sc ##ept ##ibility
a novel pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome named corona ##virus disease - 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , which caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and broken in wu ##han , china in the end of 2019 . unfortunately , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l agent or vaccine available to treat sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections . also , information regarding the im ##mun ##ological characteristics in co ##vid - 19 patients remains limited . here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors ( hd ) and 38 co ##vid - 19 patients to analyze changes in γ ##δ t cells . in comparison to hd , the γ ##δ t cells percentage was decreased . γ ##δ t cells are able to immediately respond to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and up ##re ##gul ##ate the activation marker cd ##25 . in addition , the increased expression of cd ##4 in γ ##δ t cells may serve as a bio ##mark ##er for the assessment of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
wastewater surveillance may represent a complementary approach to measure the presence and even prevalence of infectious diseases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited . moreover , aggregate , population - wide data can help inform modeling efforts . we tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in massachusetts and found the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at high ti ##ters in the period from march 18 - 25 using rt - q ##pc ##r . we then confirmed the identity of the pc ##r product by direct dna sequencing . viral ti ##ters observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinical ##ly confirmed cases in massachusetts as of march 25 . the reason for the disc ##re ##pan ##cy is not yet clear , however , and until further experiments are complete , these data do not necessarily indicate that clinical estimates are incorrect . our approach is scala ##ble and may be useful in modeling the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic and future outbreak ##s .  
the literature reports several symptoms of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in humans such as fever , cough , fatigue , pneumonia , and headache . furthermore , patients infected with similar strains ( sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v ) suffered test ##is , liver , or thyroid damage . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . our hypothesis was that as ace ##2 is essential to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus invasion , then brain regions where ace ##2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection . thus , the expression of other genes which are also over - expressed in those damaged areas could be affected . we used mrna expression levels data of genes provided by the allen human brain atlas ( aba ) , and computed spatial correlation ##s with the link ##rb ##rain platform . genes whose co - expression is spatial ##ly correlated to that of ace ##2 were then clustered into 16 groups , depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed ( as described by the nc ##bi genes database ) . the list of organs where genes sharing local over - expression with the ace ##2 gene are the most expressed is astonishing ##ly similar to the organs affected by co ##vid - 19 .  
the entry of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 into host cells is dependent upon ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , which serves as a functional attachment receptor for the viral spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , and the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 which allows fusion of the viral and host cell membranes . we devised a quantitative measure to estimate genetic deter ##mina ##nts of ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 expression and applied this measure to > 2 , 500 individuals . our data show significant variability in genetic deter ##mina ##nts of ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 expression among individuals and between populations , and demonstrate a genetic pre ##dis ##position for lower expression levels of both key viral entry genes in african populations . these data suggest that genetic factors might lead to lower su ##sc ##ept ##ibility for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in african populations and that host genetics might help explain inter - individual variability in disease su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and severity of co ##vid - 19 .

lay summary ##our researchers took a look at a sequence of dna known as the ace ##2 gene . this gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure . but in recent times , it ’ s drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts , enabling viruses like sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to in ##fect cells . our researchers looked at the ace ##2 gene in more than 200 , 000 people , comparing their exact dna sequences to see where there are differences among people . variation in the dna sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless . but other times , small changes in the dna sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene . in this case the ace ##2 gene makes the ace ##2 protein , which is what the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus interact ##s with . we found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits ( i . e . , people with variant x tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant x ) . all of the traits we looked at were non - co ##vid - 19 - related traits , meaning we haven ’ t asked these people anything about co ##vid - 19 yet ( this is because these dna sequences were collected before the pan ##de ##mic ) . we found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ace ##2 gene . these variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ace ##2 protein : the part that interact ##s with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . we don ’ t yet know what the real - life significance of this variation is , but it ’ s possible that these variants decrease the protein ’ s ability to interact with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , thus decreasing the person ’ s likelihood of being infected . we can spec ##ulate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to co ##vid - 19 among people , where some people are more vulnerable than others , and that variants in this part of the ace ##2 gene may be one of the reasons . the research we presented here shine ##s a light on this part of the ace ##2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to co ##vid - 19 and similar viruses .

abstract ##in december 2019 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 emerged causing the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . sar ##s - co ##v , the agent responsible for the 2003 sar ##s outbreak , utilizes ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 host molecules for viral entry . ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 have recently been implicated in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral infection . additional host molecules including adam ##17 , cat ##he ##ps ##in l , cd ##14 ##7 , and gr ##p ##7 ##8 may also function as receptors for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to determine the expression and in situ local ##ization of candidate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptors in the respiratory mu ##cos ##a , we analyzed gene expression data ##set ##s from air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells of 51 ##5 healthy subjects , gene promoter activity analysis using the fan ##tom ##5 data ##set containing 120 distinct sample types , single cell rna sequencing ( sc ##rna ##se ##q ) of 10 healthy subjects , im ##mun ##ob ##lot ##s on multiple air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cell types , and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry on 98 human lung samples . we demonstrate absent to low ace ##2 promoter activity in a variety of lung ep ##ith ##elial cell samples and low ace ##2 gene expression in both micro ##ar ##ray and sc ##rna ##se ##q data ##set ##s of ep ##ith ##elial cell populations . consistent with gene expression , rare ace ##2 protein expression was observed in the air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um and al ##ve ##oli of human lung . we present confirm ##atory evidence for the presence of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , cd ##14 ##7 , and gr ##p ##7 ##8 protein in vitro in air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of cd ##14 ##7 in the respiratory mu ##cos ##a . collectively , our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamic ##ally regulating ace ##2 expression in human lung , perhaps in periods of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , and also suggest that alternate receptors for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection .  
abstract ##gen ##etic sub ##ty ##ping of viruses and bacteria is a critical tool for visual ##izing and modeling their geographic distribution and temporal dynamics . quan ##tify ##ing viral dynamics is of particular importance for the novel corona ##virus responsible for co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . effective containment strategies and potential future therapeutic and vaccine strategies will likely require a precise and quantitative understanding of viral transmission and evolution . in this paper , we employ an entropy - based analysis to identify mutation ##al signatures of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains in the gi ##sai ##d database available as of april 5 , 2020 . our analysis method identifies nu ##cle ##otide sites within the viral genome which are highly inform ##ative of variation between the viral genome ##s sequence ##d in different individuals . these sites are used to character ##ize individual virus sequence with a characteristic inform ##ative sub ##type marker ( is ##m ) . the is ##ms provide signatures that can be efficiently and rapidly utilized to quantitative ##ly trace viral dynamics through geography and time . we show that by analyzing the is ##m of currently available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences , we are able to profile international and inter ##region ##al differences in viral sub ##type , and visual ##ize the emergence of viral sub ##type ##s in different countries over time . to valid ##ate and demonstrate the utility of is ##m - based sub ##ty ##ping : ( 1 ) we show the distinct genetic sub ##type ##s of european infections , in which early on infections are related to the viral sub ##type ##s that has become dominant in italy followed by the development of local sub ##type ##s , ( 2 ) we distinguish sub ##type ##s associated with outbreak ##s in distinct parts of the united states , identify the development of a local sub ##type potentially due to community to transmission and distinguish it from the predominant sub ##type in new york , suggesting that the outbreak in new york is linked to imported cases from europe . ( 3 ) we present results that quantitative ##ly show the temporal behavior of the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from local ##ization in china to a pattern of distinct regional sub ##type ##s as the virus spreads throughout the world over time . accordingly , we show that genetic sub ##ty ##ping using entropy - based is ##ms can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree - based analysis , such as the next ##stra ##in [ 9 ] project , in efficiently quan ##tify ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dynamics to enable modeling , data - mining , and machine learning tools . following from this initial study , we have developed a pipeline to dynamic ##ally generate is ##ms for newly added sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences and generate updated
abstract ##co ##vid - 19 is prevalent in the elderly . old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to al ##ve ##olar damage , suggesting that lung sen ##escence may increase the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and replication . considering that human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ##s ; sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v ) require host cellular factors for infection and replication , we analyzed gen ##otype - tissue expression ( gt ##ex ) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcription ##al changes in human protein - coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses . we found decreased expression of the gene tri ##bble ##s homo ##log 3 ( tri ##b ##3 ) during aging in male individuals , and its protein was predicted to interact with hc ##ov ##s nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein and rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase . using publicly available lung single - cell data , we found tri ##b ##3 expressed mainly in al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells that express sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor ace ##2 . functional enrichment analysis of age - related genes , in common with sar ##s - co ##v - induced per ##tur ##bation ##s , revealed genes associated with the mit ##otic cell cycle and surf ##act ##ant metabolism . given that tri ##b ##3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication , the decreased expression of tri ##b ##3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the co ##vid - 19 . thus , drugs that stimulate tri ##b ##3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease .

the ongoing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic presents a unique challenge for diagnostic laboratories around the world . automation of work ##flow ##s in molecular diagnostic ##s is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinic ##ians , as well as providing fast - tracked rapid testing for urgent cases . in this study we evaluated a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ld ##t for the ne ##um ##od ##x 96 system , a fully automated ( sample to result ) rt - pc ##r platform offering random - access capabilities and good clinical performance for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing .  
the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has emerged as one of the most compelling public health challenges of our time . to address the myriad issues generated by this pan ##de ##mic , an interdisciplinary breadth of research , clinical , and public health communities have rapidly engaged to find answers and solutions . one area of active inquiry is understanding the mode ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission . while respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission , other mechanisms are possible . of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breast ##fe ##eding or consumption of human milk . however , there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human corona ##virus ( including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) via human milk and / or breast ##fe ##eding . there is a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human corona ##virus 229 ##e , a single study evaluating presence of sar ##s - co ##v in human milk ( it was negative ) , and no published data on mer ##s - co ##v and human milk . there are 9 case studies of human milk tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; none detected the virus . importantly , none of the published studies on corona ##virus ##es and human milk report validation of their analytical methods for use in human milk . these reports are evaluated here , and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of corona ##virus ##es ( in particular , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) during breast ##fe ##eding are discussed .  
abstract ##the 2019 novel severe respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide . the present study followed computational approaches to identify b - and t - cell ep ##ito ##pes for spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by its interactions with the human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen all ##eles . we identified twenty - four peptide stretches on the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein that are well conserved among the reported strains . the s protein structure further valid ##ated the presence of predicted peptide ##s on the surface . out of which twenty are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable ep ##ito ##pe binding efficiency . the work could be useful for understanding the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant regions in the surface protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide - based diagnostic ##s .  
the global pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a disaster for human society . a convenient and reliable in vitro neutral ##ization ass ##ay is very important for the development of neutral ##izing antibodies , vaccines and other inhibitors . in this study , g protein - def ##icient ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##vd ##g ) bearing full - length and truncated spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were evaluated . the virus packaging efficiency of vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - sd ##el ##18 ( s with c - terminal 18 amino acid tr ##un ##cation ) is much higher than vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - s . a neutral ##ization ass ##ay for antibody screening and serum neutral ##izing ti ##ter quan ##ti ##fication was established based on vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - sd ##el ##18 pseudo ##virus and human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) over ##ex ##pressed b ##h ##k ##21 cell ( b ##h ##k ##21 - ha ##ce ##2 ) . the experimental results can be obtained by automatically counting e ##gf ##p positive cell number at 12 hours after infection , making the ass ##ay convenient and high - through ##put . the serum neutral ##izing ti ##ter of co ##vid - 19 con ##vale ##scent patients measured by vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - sd ##el ##18 pseudo ##virus ass ##ay has a good correlation with live sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ass ##ay . seven neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies targeting receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - s were obtained . this efficient and reliable pseudo ##virus ass ##ay model could facilitate the development of new drugs and vaccines .  
co ##vid - 19 , caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , has recently been announced as a pan ##de ##mic all over the world . plenty of diagnostic , prevent ##ive and therapeutic knowledge ##s have been enriched from clinical studies since december 2019 . however , animal models , particularly non - human primate models , are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients , evaluation ##s of anti - viral drugs and vaccines . in this study , two families of non - human primate ##s , old world monkeys ( 12 mac ##aca mu ##lat ##ta , 6 mac ##aca fa ##sc ##icular ##is ) and new world monkeys ( 6 call ##ith ##rix ja ##cc ##hus ) , were experimental ##ly in ##oc ##ulated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . clinical signs were recorded . samples were collected for analysis of viral shed ##ding , vi ##rem ##ia and his ##top ##ath ##ological examination . increased body temperature was observed in 100 % ( 12 / 12 ) m . mu ##lat ##ta , 33 . 3 % ( 2 / 6 ) m . fa ##sc ##icular ##is and none ( 0 / 6 ) of c . ja ##cc ##hus post in ##oc ##ulation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . all of m . mu ##lat ##ta and m . fa ##sc ##icular ##is showed chest radio ##graphic abnormal ##ity . viral genome ##s were detected in nasal sw ##ab ##s , throat sw ##ab ##s , anal sw ##ab ##s and blood from all 3 species of monkeys . viral shed ##ding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post in ##oc ##ulation . from nec ##rop ##sie ##d m . mu ##lat ##ta and m . fa ##sc ##icular ##is , tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung , we ##asa ##nd , bro ##nch ##us and sp ##leen . no viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 nec ##rop ##sie ##d c . ja ##cc ##hus . severe gross lesions and his ##top ##ath ##ological changes were observed in lung , heart and stomach of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected animals . in summary , we have established a nh ##p model for co ##vid - 19 , which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines , and investigate viral pathogen ##esis . m . mu ##lat ##ta is the most susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v ##2 infection , followed by m . fa ##sc ##icular ##is and c . ja ##cc ##hus .  
co ##vid - 19 , the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , has rapidly spread throughout the world and was declared a pan ##de ##mic by the world health organization , thus leading to a rapid surge in the efforts to understand the mechanisms of transmission , methods of prevention , and potential the ##ra ##pies . while co ##vid - 19 frequently manifest ##s as a respiratory infection , 1 there is evidence for infection of the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal ( gi ) tract ##1 – 4 with documented viral rna shed ##ding in the stool of infected patients . 2 , 4 in this study , we aimed to investigate the expression of ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , which are required for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry into mammalian cells , 5 from single - cell rna sequencing ( sc ##rna - se ##q ) data ##set ##s of five different parts of the gi tract : es ##op ##ha ##gus , stomach , pan ##cre ##as , small int ##est ##ine , and colon / rec ##tum .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stress ##ing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before . the aim of present study was to develop a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection protocol which can be performed within minimal resources and time ##frame . for this purpose , we implemented the reverse transcription loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) methodology for the qu ##ali ##tative detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . in order to improve the detection capability , the rt - lamp ass ##ay was developed to simultaneously amp ##li ##fy two viral genes : or ##f ##1 ##a and n . a total of 45 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 associated corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) cases were enrolled . viral rna was extracted from the nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab samples and analyzed simultaneously using pc ##r and rt - lamp protocols . overall , our sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dual gene rt - lamp ass ##ay was found to be 95 % accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross - react ##ivity or false - positive result in non - co ##vid - 19 samples . further evaluation on larger and multi - cent ##ric co ##hort ##s is currently underway to establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at point - of - care settings .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus is wr ##eak ##ing havoc globally , yet knowledge of its biology is limited . climate and seasonal ##ity influence the distributions of many diseases , and studies suggest a link between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and cool weather . one such study , building species distribution models ( sd ##ms ) , predicted sar ##s - co ##v - 2 risk may remain concentrated in the northern hemisphere , shifting northward in summer months . others have highlighted issues with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sd ##ms , notably : the primary niche of the virus is the host it in ##fect ##s , climate may be a weak distribution ##al predict ##or , global prevalence data have issues , and the virus is not in a population equilibrium . while these issues should be considered , climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to further examine if there is a link , we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 county - level data from the united states . we show that sd ##ms built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data , while sd ##ms built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the us . the population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current us viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver . still , we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas . this coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the us sar ##s - co ##v - 2 distribution . climate ' s role on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 should continue to be cautiously examined , but at this time we should assume that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can spread anywhere in the us .  
background : the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide . there are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments , and vaccines are likely over a year away . at present , non - pharmaceutical interventions ( np ##is ) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus , but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disrupt ##ive measures . modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of np ##is for both suppression and mit ##iga ##tion efforts . methods and findings : we developed co ##r ##vid , an adaptation of the agent - based influenza model called flute to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission . to demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of np ##is , we simulated transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the united states . transmission in the model occurs in several settings , including at home , at work , and in schools . we simulated several combinations of np ##is that targeted transmission in these settings , such as school closure ##s and work - from - home policies . we also simulated three strategies for testing and iso ##lating sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases . for our demonstration parameters , we show that testing followed by home isolation of as ##cer ##tained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount . we also show how further reductions may follow by iso ##lating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by qu ##aran ##tin ##ing all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest . conclusions : models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home , work , and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of np ##is , as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as va ##cci ##nation . co ##r ##vid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions , although there is no substitute for real - world observations . our results on np ##i effectiveness sum ##mar ##ize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes . model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease , both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for quantitative modeling . models of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better - understood .  
abstract ##fo ##llo ##wing the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 emerged at the end of 2019 as a highly pathogen ##ic infectious agent that rapidly spread around the world . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 shares high sequence homo ##logy with sar ##s - co ##v and causes acute , highly lethal pneumonia corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for sar ##s - co ##v . like other beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 en ##code four major structural proteins : spike ( s ) , membrane ( m ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and envelope ( e ) . sar ##s - co ##v e protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly . moreover , sar ##s corona ##virus ##es lacking e are at ##ten ##uated in vivo , suggesting that co ##v e may act as a critical vi ##ru ##lence factor not only in sar ##s - co ##v but also in the case of the new corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . ec ##top ##ic expression of sar ##s - co ##v e was previously shown to trigger ap ##op ##tosis ( cell suicide ) of t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia being a common feature observed in fatal cases following viral infections . importantly , t - cell ap ##op ##tosis was shown to involve interaction between the c - terminal region of sar ##s - co ##v e and the bc ##l - 2 family member bc ##l - xl , which acts as a potent anti - ap ##op ##to ##tic protein . here we provide the first observation that the sar ##s - co ##v e and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 e proteins share a conserved bc ##l - 2 homo ##logy 3 ( b ##h ##3 ) - like motif in their c - terminal region , a well - studied motif shown to be necessary for sar ##s - co ##v e binding to bc ##l - xl . we used available sequence data for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and related corona ##virus ##es , in combination with structural information , to study the structure to biological activity relationships of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 e in relation with its b ##h ##3 - like motif . our analysis of the sar ##s - co ##v e interact ##ome further revealed that the predicted sar ##s - co ##v - 2 network is extensively wired to the bc ##l - 2 ap ##op ##to ##tic switch . research is therefore needed to establish

abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) outcomes vary from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection to death . this di ##spar ##ity may reflect different air ##way levels of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor , ace ##2 , and the spike protein act ##iva ##tor , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . here we explore the role of genetics and co - expression networks in regulating these genes in the air ##way , through the analysis of nasal air ##way transcript ##ome data from 69 ##5 children . we identify expression quantitative trait lo ##ci ( e ##q ##tl ) for both ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , that vary in frequency across world populations . importantly , we find t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 is part of a mu ##cus secret ##ory network , highly up ##re ##gul ##ated by t ##2 inflammation through the action of inter ##le ##uki ##n - 13 , and that inter ##fer ##on response to respiratory viruses highly up ##re ##gul ##ates ace ##2 expression . finally , we define air ##way responses to corona ##virus infections in children , finding that these infections up ##re ##gul ##ate il ##6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c immune response relative to other respiratory viruses . our results reveal mechanisms likely influencing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ##fect ##ivity and co ##vid - 19 clinical outcomes .  
abstract ##the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is responsible for the pan ##de ##mic of respiratory disease known as co ##vid - 19 , which emerged in the city of wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china in late 2019 . both vaccines and targeted therapeutic ##s for treatment of this disease are currently lacking . viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) with the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ( ace ##2 ) . in an earlier paper ##1 , we report on the specific residue interactions under ##pin ##ning this event . here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the rec ##om ##bina ##tion of v ##d ##j genes targeting the most solvent - exposed ace ##2 - binding residues of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein using the software tool opt ##ma ##ven - 2 . 02 . subsequently , we carry out computational affinity mat ##uration of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target ep ##ito ##pe . im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9 - mer library of “ human string content ” ( hs ##c ) 3 . we generated 60 different variable region designs and report in detail on the top five that trade - off the greatest affinity for the spike ep ##ito ##pe ( quan ##ti ##fied using the rose ##tta binding energies ) with low im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity scores . by graf ##ting these designed variable regions with framework ##s , high - affinity mono ##cl ##onal antibodies can be constructed . having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection devices and for their deployment as neutral ##izing antibodies .  
summary ##mon ##itor ##ing the mutation dynamics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to contain the pathogen . by analyzing 106 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and 39 sar ##s genome sequences , we provided direct genetic evidence that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has a much lower mutation rate than sar ##s . minimum evolution ph ##yl ##ogen ##y analysis revealed the put ##ative original status of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the early - stage spread history . the disc ##re ##pan ##t ph ##yl ##ogen ##ies for the spike protein and its receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rear ##rang ##ement prior to the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . despite that we found the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is particularly more conserved , we identified a mutation that leads to weaker receptor binding capability , which concerns a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sample collected on 27th january 2020 from india . this represents the first report of a significant sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mutant , and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified . highlights ##base ##d on the currently available genome sequence data , we proved that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome has a much lower mutation rate and genetic diversity than sar ##s during the 2002 - 2003 outbreak . the spike ( s ) protein encoding gene of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is found relatively more conserved than other protein - encoding genes , which is a good indication for the ongoing anti ##vira ##l drug and vaccine development . minimum evolution ph ##yl ##ogen ##y analysis revealed the put ##ative original status of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the early - stage spread history . we confirmed a previously reported rear ##rang ##ement in the s protein arrangement of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and propose that this rear ##rang ##ement should have occurred between human sar ##s - co ##v and a bat sar ##s - co ##v , at a time point much earlier before sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission to human . we provided first evidence that a mu ##tated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with reduced human ace ##2 receptor binding affinity have emerged in india based on a sample collected on 27th january 2020 .  
due to urgency and demand , numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys are rapidly being developed and placed on the market with limited validation on clinical samples . thorough validation of ser ##ological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , confirmation of molecular results , contact tracing , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies . this study evaluated the sensitivity and specific ##ity of nine commercially available ser ##ological tests . these included three enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ##s ) and six point - of - care ( po ##c ) lateral flow tests . the ass ##ays were valid ##ated using serum samples from : i ) sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pc ##r - positive patients with a documented first day of disease ; ii ) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in china ; iii ) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other corona ##virus ##es or non - corona ##virus ##es ; and iv ) sera from patients positive for deng ##ue virus , cy ##tom ##ega ##lov ##irus and epstein barr virus . the results showed 100 % specific ##ity for the want ##ai sar ##s - co ##v - 2 total antibody elisa , 93 % for the euro ##im ##mun i ##ga elisa , and 96 % for the euro ##im ##mun i ##gg elisa with sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 90 % , 90 % , and 65 % , respectively . the overall performance of the po ##c tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of auto ##bio diagnostic ##s > d ##yna ##mi ##ker biotechnology = ct ##k bio ##tech > art ##ron laboratories > ac ##ro bio ##tech ≥ hang ##zhou all ##test bio ##tech . overall , these findings will facilitate selection of ser ##ological ass ##ays for the detection sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific antibodies towards diagnosis as well as ser ##o - ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and vaccine development studies .  
background sw ##ab ##s for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are routinely collected by health care workers , putting them at risk of infection and requiring use of personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) . self - collected sw ##ab ##s offer many advantages provided detection rate of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised . methods in a prospective study , patients attending dedicated co ##vid - 19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self - collect ( sc ) nasal and throat sw ##ab ##s prior to health worker collection ( hc ) . two different laboratory services participated , with hc at site 1 collecting nasal and throat sw ##ab ##s and at site 2 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al ( np ) and throat sw ##ab ##s . samples were anal ##yse ##d for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as well as common respiratory viruses . concord ##ance of results between methods was assessed using cohen ##s kappa ( κ ) . results of 236 patients sampled by hc and sc , 25 had co ##vid - 19 ( 24 by hc and 25 by sc ) and 63 had other respiratory viruses ( 56 by hc and 58 by sc ) . sc was highly concord ##ant with hc ( κ = 0 . 89 ##0 ) for all viruses including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and more concord ##ant than hc to positive results by any method ( κ = 0 . 95 ##9 vs 0 . 93 ##3 ) . conclusions self - collection of throat and nasal sw ##ab ##s offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other common respiratory viruses . high viral load of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings . self - collection also provides patients with easier access to testing , reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for pp ##e .  
by the first week of april 2020 , more than 1 , 500 , 000 positive cases of co ##vid - 19 and more than 50 , 000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide . while developed countries such as the usa , italy , england , france , spain , and germany struggle to mit ##igate the propagation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic arrived in latin america , india , and africa - territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly under ##dev ##elo ##ped . an actual epidemic emergency does not provide the required time ##frame for testing new diagnostic strategies ; therefore , the first line of response must be based on commercially and readily available resources . here , we demonstrate the combined use of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) - printed inc ##uba ##tion chamber for commercial ep ##pen ##dorf pc ##r tubes , and a color ##ime ##tric em ##bo ##diment of a loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( lamp ) reaction scheme for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acids . we used this strategy to detect and amp ##li ##fy sar ##s - co ##v - 2 dna sequences using a set of in - house designed in ##itia ##tors that target regions encoding the n protein . we were able to detect and amp ##li ##fy sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acids in the range of ~ 625 to 2 x 105 dna copies by this straightforward method . the accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostic ##s strategy may provide a cost - efficient and reliable alternative for use during the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mics , particularly in under ##dev ##elo ##ped regions were the availability of rt - q ##pc ##r instruments may be limited . moreover , the port ##ability , ease of use , and rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point - of - care sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection efforts during the pan ##de ##mics .  
the novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is currently causing concern in the medical , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and mathematical communities as the virus is rapidly spreading around the world . internationally , there are more than 1 , 200 , 000 cases detected and confirmed in the world on april 6 . the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mild sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases are just going to be really crucial for us to understand what is driving this epidemic to transmit rapidly . combining a mathematical model of severe ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) transmission with data from china , south korea , italy , france , germany and united kingdom , we provide the epidemic predictions of the number of reported and un ##re ##port ##ed cases for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic ##s and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures for each country .  
corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a global pan ##de ##mic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection of host cells occurs predominantly via binding of the viral surface spike protein to the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor . hyper ##tension and pre - existing cardiovascular disease are risk factors for mor ##bid ##ity from co ##vid - 19 , and it remains uncertain whether the use of ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme inhibitors ( ace ##i ) or ang ##iot ##ens ##in receptor block ##ers ( ar ##b ) impacts infection and disease . here , we aim to shed light on this question by assessing ace ##2 expression in normal and disease ##d human my ##oca ##rdial samples profile ##d by bulk and single nucleus rna - se ##q .

abstract ##the novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) disease termed co ##vid - 19 ( corona ##virus disease - 19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ) is causing a massive pan ##de ##mic worldwide , threatening public health systems across the globe . during this ongoing co ##vid - 19 outbreak , nuclei ##c acid detection has played an important role in early diagnosis . here we report a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection protocol using a crisp ##r - based crisp ##r diagnostic platform - cd ##ete ##ction ( cas ##12 ##b - mediated dna detection ) . by combining sample treatment protocols and nuclei ##c acid amp ##li ##fication methods with cd ##ete ##ction , we have established an integrated viral nuclei ##c acid detection platform - cas ##de ##tec ( crisp ##r - assisted detection ) . the detection limit of cas ##de ##tec for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pseudo ##virus is 1 × 104 copies / ml , with no cross react ##ivity observed . our ass ##ay design and optimization process can provide guidance for future crisp ##r - based nuclei ##c acid detection ass ##ay development and optimization .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic is caused by the single - stranded rna virus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , a virus of zoo ##not ##ic origin that was first detected in wu ##han , china in december 2019 . there is evidence that homo ##log ##ous rec ##om ##bina ##tion contributed to this cross - species transmission . since that time the virus has demonstrated a high prop ##ens ##ity for human - to - human transmission . here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid poly ##morphism ##s in the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id at positions 203 and 204 ( r ##20 ##3 ##k / g ##20 ##4 ##r ) due to three adjacent nu ##cle ##otide changes across the two cod ##ons ( i . e . ag ##g g ##ga to aaa c ##ga ) . this new strain within the l ##gg clade may have arise ##n by a form of homo ##log ##ous rec ##om ##bina ##tion from the core sequence ( cs - b ) of the transcription - regulating sequences of sas - co ##v - 2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from europe during the month of march 2020 . we note that these poly ##morphism ##s are predicted to reduce the binding of an overly ##ing put ##ative h ##la - c * 07 - restricted ep ##ito ##pe and that h ##la - c * 07 is prevalent in caucasian ##s being carried by > 40 % of the population . the findings suggest that homo ##log ##ous rec ##om ##bina ##tion may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased viral fitness and adaptation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to human populations .  
summary ##the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is a currently un ##con ##tro ##lled pan ##de ##mic and the et ##iol ##ogical agent of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . it is important to study the host range of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans . in addition , insight into the ability of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - like viruses to utilize animal or ##th ##olo ##gs of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor ace ##2 might provide structural insight into improving ace ##2 - based viral entry inhibitors . here we show that ace ##2 or ##th ##olo ##gs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , as well as that of sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , bat corona ##virus rat ##g ##13 , and a corona ##virus isolated from pang ##olin ##s . some of these species , including camel ##s , cattle , horses , goats , sheep , pigs , cats , and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission , and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of co ##vid - 19 . we show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 1 entry could be potent ##ly blocked by rec ##om ##bina ##nt i ##gg fc - fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor - binding domains ( rb ##d - fc ) and soluble ace ##2 ( ace ##2 - fc ) . moreover , an ace ##2 - fc variant , which carries a d ##30 ##e mutation and has ace ##2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 61 ##5 , out ##per ##forms all the other ace ##2 - fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses . our data suggest that rb ##d - fc and ace ##2 - fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pan ##de ##mic .  
abstract ##co ##vid - 19 has become a global pan ##de ##mic that threatens millions of people worldwide . there is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) causing this disease . the main pro ##tea ##se of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) , is highly conserved across corona ##virus ##es and is essential for the mat ##uration process of viral poly ##pro ##tein . sc ##ute ##llar ##iae ra ##di ##x ( huang ##qi ##n in chinese ) , the root of sc ##ute ##llar ##ia bai ##cal ##ensis has been widely used in traditional chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms . the extracts of s . bai ##cal ##ensis have exhibited broad spectrum anti ##vira ##l activities . we studied the anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 activity of s . bai ##cal ##ensis and its ingredient compounds . we found that the ethanol extract of s . bai ##cal ##ensis inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro activity in vitro and the replication of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ve ##ro cells with an ec ##50 of 0 . 74 μ ##g / ml . among the major components of s . bai ##cal ##ensis , bai ##cal ##ein strongly inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro activity with an ic ##50 of 0 . 39 μ ##m . we further identified four bai ##cal ##ein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro activity at micro ##m concentration . our study demonstrates that the extract of s . bai ##cal ##ensis has effective anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 activity and bai ##cal ##ein and analogue compounds are strong sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitors .  
in this study , we analyzed full - length sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s from multiple countries to determine early trends in the evolutionary dynamics of the novel co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . results indicated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 evolved early into at least three phylogenetic groups , characterized by positive selection at specific residues of the accessory proteins of ##r ##3 ##a and or ##f ##8 ##a . we also report evidence of ep ##ista ##tic interactions among sites in the genome that may be important in the generation of variants adapted to humans . these observations might impact not only public health , but also suggest more studies are needed to understand the genetic mechanisms that may affect the development of therapeutic and prevent ##ive tools , like anti ##vira ##ls and vaccines .  
a disease outbreak named co ##vid - 19 , caused by a rna virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has become pan ##de ##mic with a magnitude , which is da ##unt ##ing to all public health institutions in the absence of specific anti ##vira ##l treatment . surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication . small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) is a prospective tool of the rna interference ( rna ##i ) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppress ##ing viral gene expression through hybrid ##ization and neutral ##ization of target complementary mrna . so , in this study , the power of rna interference technology was harness ##ed to develop sir ##na molecules against specific target genes namely , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein gene and surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gene . conserved sequence from 139 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 sir ##na that can ina ##ct ##ivate nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ph ##os ##ph ##op ##rot ##ein and surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein genes . finally , through a rigorous filtering process 8 sir ##na molecules were selected with ex ##ert ##s the best action . these predicted sir ##nas should effectively silence the genes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 during sir ##na mediated treatment assisting in the response against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the sar ##s - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) spike ( s ) protein media ##tes entry of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 into cells expressing the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the s protein engages ace ##2 through its receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , an independently folded 197 - amino acid fragment of the 127 ##3 - amino acid s - protein proto ##mer . antibodies to the rb ##d domain of sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v - 1 ) , a closely related corona ##virus which emerged in 2002 - 2003 , have been shown to potent ##ly neutral ##ize sar ##s - co ##v - 1 s - protein - mediated entry , and the presence of anti - rb ##d antibodies co ##rre ##lates with neutral ##ization in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 con ##vale ##scent sera . here we show that im ##mun ##ization with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d eli ##cit ##s a robust neutral ##izing antibody response in rodents , comparable to 100 μ ##g / ml of ace ##2 - i ##g , a potent sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry inhibitor . importantly , anti - sera from im ##mun ##ized animals did not media ##te antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) of s - protein - mediated entry under conditions in which z ##ika virus ad ##e was readily observed . these data suggest that an rb ##d - based vaccine for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could be safe and effective .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic is an urgent global public health emergency and warrant ##s investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral proteins involved in host cell ad ##hesion . the recent comparative gen ##omic studies highlight the insertion of fur ##in pro ##tea ##se site in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein alert ##ing possible modification in the viral spike protein and its eventual entry to host cell and presence of fur ##in site implicated to vi ##ru ##lence . here we structurally show how fur ##in interact ##s with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein homo ##tri ##mer at s ##1 / s ##2 region , which under ##lined the mechanism and mode of action , which is a key for host cell entry . un ##rave ##lling the structural features of the bid ##ing site opens the arena in rising bon ##af ##ide antibodies targeting to block the fur ##in cleavage and have great implications in the development of fur ##in inhibitors or therapeutic ##s .  
the recent outbreak of the newly emerged novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) presents a big challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolate ##s are not available while there is an increasing evidence that the epidemic is more widespread than initially thought , as well as spreading internationally across borders through travellers does already happen warrant ##ing a methodology for the rapid detection of the infection to control sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . aim : we intended to develop and deploy a robust and rapid diagnostic methodology using lamp ass ##ay for use in point of care settings to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methodology : in the present study , we have developed a valid ##ated rapid diagnostic procedure to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using lamp ass ##ay , its design relying on iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication of the nuclei ##c acids of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . results : the lamp ass ##ay developed detect ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection rapidly with high sensitivity and reliability . the data generated by lamp ass ##ay were comparable and at par with the data generated by real - time pc ##r method . conclusion : the present study demonstrates that the lamp ass ##ay developed was a rapid , reliable , sensitive and cost effective method to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in a point of care as well as in laboratory settings .  
the rapid spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus infection has led to the development of molecular and ser ##olo ##gic tests in a short period of time . while tests such as rt - pc ##r have applications in the immediate diagnosis revealing the presence of the virus , ser ##ological tests can be used to determine previous exposure to the virus and complement acute diagnosis . antibody production can occur as early as 5 days post - infection . both i ##gm and i ##gg specific anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies can be a useful tool to test faster and larger groups of individuals . the objective of this study was to carry out a review of the different ser ##ological tests offered to detect antigen or antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . this information should be useful for decision take ##rs in different countries to choose a test according to their needs . based on web pages that listed ser ##ological ass ##ays , we found 226 coming from 20 countries , the majority are indirect tests for specific antibodies detection ( n 180 ) and use im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphy methods ( n 110 ) with samples coming from blood - derived products ( n 105 ) . measuring i ##gm / i ##gg at the same time ( n 112 ) and a procedure time of < 20 min ( n 83 ) are the most common . the overall average sensitivity was 91 . 8 % and specific ##ity was 97 % . most of the tests are currently for in vitro diagnosis ( iv ##d ) . this information gathered could change day by day due to the ex ##ped ##ite process of production and emergency of authorization use .  
we have analyzed the cell - type - specific expression of the ren ##in - ang ##iot ##ens ##in system ( ras ) components across 141 cell types or sub ##type ##s as defined by single - cell rna - se ##q ( sc ##rna - se ##q ) analysis . ace ##2 , one of the components of ras , also facilitates sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry into cells in cooperation with its associated pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . therefore , our analysis also contributes to the understanding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , spreading of the virus throughout the body , and potential viral interference with ras in co ##vid - 19 patients .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 emerged in december 2019 in wu ##han , china and has since infected over 1 . 5 million people , of which over 100 , 000 have died . as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spreads across the planet , speculation ##s remain about the evolution of the virus and the range of human cells that can be infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in this study , we report the isolation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from two co ##vid - 19 patients in toronto , canada . we determined the gen ##omic sequences of the two isolate ##s and identified single nu ##cle ##otide changes in representative populations of our virus stocks . more importantly , we have tested a wide range of human immune cells for in ##fect ##ivity with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we confirm from our studies that human primary peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) are not per ##missive to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 continues to spread globally , it is essential to monitor any small nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating strains of the virus to determine cell su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and pathogen ##ici ##ty using in vitro and in vivo infection models .  
the appearance and spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) led to the official declaration of a global pan ##de ##mic , with states in the us implementing shelter in place orders at an unprecedented scale . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has a robust person - to - person transmission rate and an as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic period of two weeks or more , leading to widespread infection that has overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure ##s around the globe . effective public health measures require extensive , accurate , and rapid testing to determine infection rates . here we describe the strategy we used to establish a cl ##ia - licensed clinical laboratory to perform a valid ##ated laboratory - developed test ( ld ##t ) for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in berkeley , california and the surrounding bay area community . our procedures for implementing the technical , regulatory , and data management works ##tream ##s necessary for clinical sample processing provide a road ##ma ##p to aid others in setting up similar testing centers .  
this manuscript is based on the method we developed urgently to deal with the research requirement in the conflict between achieving a complete genome sequence for the evolutionary history of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 study and the low viral rna concentration . here , in this manuscript , we developed a set of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enrichment probe ##s to increase the sensitivity of sequence - based virus detection and characterization via obtaining the comprehensive genome sequence . following the cdc health and safety guidelines , we test the concept using the cult ##uring super ##nat ##ant contain sar ##s - co ##v - 2 particles , and its full - length sequence was used for further analysis . the fraction of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 end ##ogen ##ous dna was 93 . 47 % with cluster factor about 1 . 1 , which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reference sequence significantly increased , compared to meta ##gen ##omic sequencing technology , following sar ##s - co ##v - 2 probe enrichment . moreover , based on the high - quality sequence , we discussed the het ##ero ##zy ##gos ##ity and viral expression during replication of corona ##virus , and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high - quality samples from the genome variation map ( g ##v ##m ) ( on 2020 / 03 / 22 ) . we believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles . this would allow the clinic ##ian to co ##rre ##late the diagnostic data with molecular monitoring in viral evolution ##al , the most importantly , to track the functional mutation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the broad - spectrum anti ##para ##sit ##ic agent iv ##er ##me ##ct ##in has been very recently found to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in vitro and proposed as a candidate for drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing in co ##vid - 19 . in the present report the in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity end - points are analyzed from the ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic perspective . the available ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic data from clinical ##ly relevant and excessive dos ##ing studies indicate that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 inhibitor ##y concentrations are not likely to be attain ##able in humans .  
the unprecedented pan ##de ##mic of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has created worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment , in particular respiratory protection such as n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator ##s . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission is frequently occurring in hospital settings , with numerous reported cases of nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission highlighting the vulnerability of healthcare workers . in general , n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator ##s are designed for single use prior to disposal . here , we have analyzed four readily available and often used deco ##nta ##mina ##tion methods : uv , 70 % ethanol , 70 ##c heat and vapor ##ized hydrogen per ##oxide for ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 on n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator ##s . equally important we assessed the function of the n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator ##s after multiple wear and deco ##nta ##mina ##tion sessions .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has created a high demand on personal protective equipment , including di ##sp ##osa ##ble n ##9 ##5 masks . given the need for mask re ##use , we tested the feasibility of vapor ##ized hydrogen per ##oxide ( v ##hp ) , ultraviolet light ( uv ) , and ethanol deco ##nta ##mina ##tion strategies on n ##9 ##5 mask integrity and the ability to remove the infectious potential of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . fit test data showed functional degradation by both ethanol and uv deco ##nta ##mina ##tion to different degrees . v ##hp treated masks showed no significant change in function after two treatments . we also report a single sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vi ##ru ##ci ##dal experiment using ve ##ro e ##6 cell infection . we hope our data will guide further research for evidenced - based decisions for di ##sp ##osa ##ble n ##9 ##5 mask re ##use and help protect care ##gi ##vers from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other pathogen ##s .  
co ##vid - 19 is associated with l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and cy ##tok ##ine storm , but no information is available on specific cellular immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we characterized sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t - cells in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome . the spike protein ( s ) proved a potent t - cell antigen and specific t - cells predominantly produced th ##1 cy ##tok ##ines . these novel data are important in vaccine design and will facilitate evaluation of vaccine candidate im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity .  
background : currently , there is a pan ##de ##mic caused by the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which causes co ##vid - 19 . we wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing . methods : we recruited individuals recently tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection through a testing program ( drive - through ) . in homes of participants , we assessed the performance of self - collected oral fluid sw ##ab specimens with and without clinic ##ian supervision , clinic ##ian - supervised self - collected mid - tu ##rbin ##ate ( nasal ) sw ##ab specimens , and clinic ##ian - collected nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens . we tested specimens with a valid ##ated reverse transcription - quantitative polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and measured cycle threshold values . sy ##mpt ##om status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant . results : we recruited 45 participants . the median age of study participant was 42 years old ( inter ##qua ##rti ##le range , 31 to 52 years ) . of the participants , 29 had at least one specimen test positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . of those , 21 ( 73 % ) of 29 reported active symptoms . by specimen type and home - based collection method , clinic ##ian - supervised self - collected oral fluid sw ##ab specimens detected 26 ( 90 % ) of 29 infected individuals , clinic ##ian - supervised self - collected nasal sw ##ab specimens detected 23 ( 85 % ) of 27 , clinic ##ian - collected posterior nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens detected 23 ( 79 % ) of 29 , and un ##mon ##itor ##ed self - collected oral fluid sw ##ab specimens detected 19 ( 66 % ) of 29 . despite nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s being considered the gold standard , 4 participants tested negative by clinic ##ian - collected nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab and positive by the 3 other specimen types . additionally , false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap . conclusions : supervised self - collected oral fluid and nasal sw ##ab specimens performed similarly to , if not better than clinic ##ian - collected nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . no sample type captured all sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , suggesting potential het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals . supervised self - collection performed com ##para ##bly
the entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic . it is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( n - co ##v ) generally distinguished as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . it has exploited human vu ##ln ##era ##bilities to corona ##virus outbreak . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life . no proven vaccine for n - co ##v is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide . international committee on taxonomy of viruses ( ict ##v ) has reached to a consensus that the virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is highly genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) outbreak of 2003 . it has been reported that sar ##s - co ##v has ~ 89 % genetic similarities with n - co ##v . with this hypothesis , the current work focuses on the identification of spread ##er nodes in sar ##s - co ##v protein interaction network . various network characteristics like edge ratio , neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spread ##ability index by virtue of which spread ##er nodes and edges are identified . the selected top spread ##er nodes having high spread ##ability index have been also valid ##ated by susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) disease model . initially , the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by sar ##s - co ##v - human protein interaction network . hence , key spread ##er nodes and edges ( ranked edges ) are un ##mas ##ked in sar ##s - co ##v proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins . the new network attribute spread ##ability index along with generated sis values of selected top spread ##er nodes when compared with the other network central ##ity based method ##ologies like degree central ##ity ( dc ) , closeness central ##ity ( cc ) , local average central ##ity ( lac ) and between ##ess central ##ity ( bc ) is found to perform relatively better than the existing - state - of - art .  
the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 since december 2019 has become a pan ##de ##mic and impacted many aspects of human society . here , we analyzed genetic variation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its related corona ##virus and found the evidence of inter ##gen ##omic rec ##om ##bina ##tion . after correction for mutation ##al bias , analysis of 137 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s as of 2 / 23 / 2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and non ##sy ##non ##ym ##ous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus . in contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for sar ##s - co ##v in its brief epidemic in 2003 , our analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s shows signs of relaxation of selection . the sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and a sequence from pang ##olin is probably due to an ancient inter ##gen ##omic intro ##gre ##ssion . therefore , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might have cryptic ##ally circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed . data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading . two mutations , 84 ##s in or ##f ##8 protein and 251 ##v in or ##f ##3 protein , occurred coincidentally with human intervention . the 84 ##s first appeared on 1 / 5 / 2020 and reached a plateau around 1 / 23 / 2020 , the lock ##down of wu ##han . 251 ##v emerged on 1 / 21 / 2020 and rapidly increased its frequency . thus , the roles of these mutations on in ##fect ##ivity need to be el ##uc ##ida ##ted . genetic diversity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 collected from china was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world . in addition , in network analysis , ha ##pl ##otype ##s collected from wu ##han city were at interior and have more mutation ##al connections , both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of co ##v - 19 was originated from china .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection has the potential for targeting central nervous system and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress . here we described the case of an otherwise healthy 60 - year old subject with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed severe progressive en ##ce ##pha ##lo ##pathy associated with mild pl ##eo ##cy ##tosis and hyper ##pro ##tein ##orra ##chia . mri was negative whereas ee ##g showed theta waves on the anterior brain regions . serum and cs ##f analyses excluded other known infectious or auto ##im ##mun ##e disorders . the patient dramatically improved after high - doses ste ##roid treatment suggesting an inflammatory - mediated brain involvement related to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection 
the corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) outbreak that originated in wu ##han , china has rapidly prop ##aga ##ted due to widespread person - to - person transmission and has resulted in over 1 , 133 , 75 ##8 cases in 197 countries with a total of 62 , 78 ##4 deaths as of april 5 , 2020 . laboratory confirmation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is performed with a virus - specific reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) test . this test can take up to two days to complete , and , due to the possibility of false negative ##s , serial testing may be required to re ##lia ##bly exclude infection . a current supply shortage of rt - pc ##r test kits compounds the short ##coming ##s of en ##trust ##ing diagnosis to the pc ##r test alone and under ##sco ##res the urgent need to provide alternative methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients . chest computed tom ##ography ( ct ) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . nevertheless , ct alone may have limited negative predict ##ive value to fully exclude infection , because of the normal radio ##logic findings in some early disease patients . in this study , we use artificial intelligence ( ai ) algorithms to integrate chest ct findings with clinical symptoms , exposure history , and / or laboratory testing to more accurately and rapidly dia ##gno ##se sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( + ) patients . we included 90 ##5 rt - pc ##r confirmed patients . 41 ##9 ( 46 . 2 % ) tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by laboratory - confirmed real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay and next - generation sequencing , while 48 ##6 patients ( 53 . 8 % ) tested negative ( confirmed by at least two additional negative rt - pc ##r tests and clinical observation ) . the proposed ai system achieved an au ##c of 0 . 92 and performed equally well in sensitivity compared to a senior thor ##ac ##ic radio ##logist on a testing set of 279 cases . the ai system also improved the detection of rt - pc ##r positive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients who presented with normal ct ##s , correctly identifying 17 / 25 ( 68 % ) patients , whereas all 25 rt - pc ##r sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - positive ct - normal patients were classified as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 negative by radio ##logists .  
since many sar ##s - co ##v - 2 carriers are assumed to exhibit no or few non - specific symptoms , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 circulation among human populations may be detected too lately and only when massive human testing is available or when cl ##inal co ##vid - 19 cases are reported . this is obviously a major pit ##fall for evaluating and possibly controlling the current epidemic . due to the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in stool samples qu ##ali ##tative detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wastewater ##s has recently been proposed as a complementary tool to investigate the virus circulation in human populations . if this assumption is correct , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 relative amounts in wastewater ##s should co ##rre ##late with the number of confirmed co ##vid - 19 cases . to test this hypothesis , we performed a time - course quantitative analysis of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 by rt - q ##pc ##r in 23 raw and 8 treated wastewater samples collected from 3 major wastewater treatment plant ( w ##wt ##p ) of the parisian area collecting 3 to 4 million inhabitants reject . this study was conducted from 5 march to 7 april 2020 . all raw wastewater samples scored positive for sar ##s - co ##v ##2 . additionally , 6 out of 8 samples from treated wastewater scored positive by rt - q ##pc ##r . treated wastewater e ##ff ##lu ##ents showed a 100 times reduction in the viral load compared to the corresponding raw wastewater samples , which agrees with previous work on enter ##ic viruses . we next compared the average level of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome ##s in wastewater samples over time with the number of confirmed fatal cases of co ##vid ##19 in paris area and in france as expected , we confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewater ##s accurately followed the increase in the number of fatal cases observed at the regional and national level therefore , our study demonstrates that the contamination of wastewater and the detection of viral genome occurred before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic . this work demonstrated that a quantitative monitoring of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 genome ##s in wastewater ##s should bring important and additional information for better survey of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 circulation at the local or regional scale . additionally , wastewater survey may provide an alternative and possibly early tool to detect pathogen ##s in populations when investigations in humans is difficult for log ##istic , ethical or economic reasons .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to in ##fect humans via the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel reservoir and can transmit between humans , most commonly via nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission . currently , no licensed vaccine is available . previously we showed that va ##cci ##nation of trans ##genic mice with chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s , encoding the mer ##s s protein , prevented disease upon lethal challenge . in the current study we show that r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues ser ##oco ##n ##verted rapidly after a single intra ##mus ##cular va ##cci ##nation with chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s . upon mer ##s - co ##v challenge va ##cci ##nated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction in viral load in lung tissue of several logs . furthermore , we did not detect mer ##s - co ##v replication in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s va ##cci ##nated animals . a prime - boost regime ##n of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s boosted antibody ti ##ters , and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues . finally , we investigated the ability of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s to protect against six different mer ##s - co ##v strains , isolated between 2012 to 2018 , from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and humans in the middle east and africa . antibodies eli ##cite ##d by chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues were able to neutral ##ize all mer ##s - co ##v strains . va ##cci ##nation of trans ##genic hd ##pp ##4 mice with chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s completely protected the animals against disease and lethal ##ity for all different mer ##s - co ##v strains . the data support further clinical development of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s supported by ce ##pi .  
human infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) cause corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) and there is currently no cure . the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) , a highly conserved pro ##tea ##se ind ##is ##pen ##sable for replication of corona ##virus ##es , is a promising target for development of broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs . to advance the speed of drug discovery and development , we investigated the inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro by natural products derived from chinese traditional medicines . bai ##cal ##in and bai ##cal ##ein were identified as the first non - co ##valent , non - pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro and exhibited potent anti ##vira ##l activities in a cell - based system . remarkably , the binding mode of bai ##cal ##ein with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro determined by x - ray protein crystal ##log ##raphy is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors . bai ##cal ##ein is perfectly en ##sco ##nce ##d in the core of the substrate - binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues , the crucial s ##1 / s ##2 sub ##sit ##es and the ox ##yan ##ion loop , acting as a ' shield ' in front of the catalytic d ##yad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site . the simple chemical structure , unique mode of action , and potent anti ##vira ##l activities in vitro , coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials , emphasize that bai ##cal ##ein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti - corona ##vira ##l drugs .  
the recent corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) causes an immense health crisis to global public health . the world health organization ( who ) declared the co ##vid - 19 as a pan ##de ##mic . the co ##vid - 19 is the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . presently , there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease . therefore , it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effect ##ual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pan ##de ##mic disease . in the current study , we collected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome from indian geographical origin against human host , further more using reverse va ##cci ##nology and im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against co ##vid ##19 . this novel study di ##vu ##lge ##d two promising antigen ##ic peptide g ##vy ##fast ##ek and n ##fr ##v ##q ##pt ##es ##iv from surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( protein accession no . - qi ##a ##9 ##85 ##8 ##3 . 1 and q ##hs ##34 ##54 ##6 . 1 ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which were pre ##dicated to be interact ##ed with class i and class ii m ##hc all ##eles and showed up to 90 % con ##ser ##van ##cy and high value of antigen ##ici ##ty . subsequently , the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigen ##ic peptide ##s with the residues of h ##la - a * 11 - 01 all ##ele for m ##hc class i and h ##la dr ##b ##1 * 04 - 01 all ##ele for m ##hc class ii . after vigorous analysis , these peptide ##s were predicted to be suitable ep ##ito ##pes which are capable to eli ##cit the strong cell - mediated immune response against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ep ##ito ##pes for vaccine production pipeline ##s in the immediate future . this novel research will certainly pa ##ve the way for a fast , reliable and vi ##rt ##uous platform to provide timely counter ##me ##as ##ure of this dangerous pan ##de ##mic disease , co ##vid - 19 . key ##words : co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics , reverse va ##cci ##nology , molecular docking , ep ##ito ##pe , vaccine candidates .  
rapidly spreading viral pan ##de ##mics , such as those caused by influenza and sar - co ##v - 2 ( co ##vid ##19 ) , require rapid action and the fastest way to combat this challenge is by rep ##ur ##po ##sing existing drugs as anti - viral therapeutic ##s . here we first show that human organ - on - a - chip ( organ chip ) micro ##fl ##uid ##ic culture devices lined by a highly differentiated , primary , human lung air ##way ep ##ith ##eli ##um culture ##d under an air - liquid interface and fed by continuous medium flow can be used to model virus entry , replication , strain - dependent vi ##ru ##lence , host cy ##tok ##ine production , and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by influenza , as well as effects of existing and novel therapeutic ##s . these air ##way chips , which contain human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells that express high levels of ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , were then used to assess the inhibitor ##y activities of 7 clinical ##ly approved drugs ( ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , ar ##bid ##ol , tore ##mi ##fen ##e , cl ##omi ##ph ##ene , am ##od ##ia ##quin ##e , vera ##pa ##mi ##l , and ami ##oda ##rone ) that we found inhibit infection by viral pseudo ##par ##tic ##les expressing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein in human huh - 7 cells , and others recently showed suppress infection by native sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ve ##ro cells . however , when these drugs were administered under flow at the maximal concentration in blood reported in clinical studies in human air ##way chips , only two of these drugs - am ##od ##ia ##quin ##e and tore ##mi ##fen ##e - significantly inhibit ##ed entry of the pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . this work suggests that human organ chip technology may be used in conjunction with existing rapid cell - based screening ass ##ays to study human disease pathogen ##esis and ex ##ped ##ite drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing in bio ##th ##rea ##t crises caused by pan ##de ##mic viruses .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 infection causing corona ##virus disease 2019 has spread worldwide . whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection needs to be determined . here , 26 cases of co ##vid - 19 in jin ##an , china , were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among these patients . a striking feature of some patients is that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could exist in patients who have virus - specific i ##gg antibodies for a very long period , with two cases for up to 50 days . one co ##vid - 19 patient who did not produce any sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - bound i ##gg successfully cleared sar ##s - co ##v - 2 after 46 days of illness , revealing that without antibody - mediated adaptive immunity , innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . overall , this report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance , especially in non - severe cases . this study also has implications for understanding the pathogen ##esis and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
background current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infections shows het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y . this study explores the role of age in potentially driving differential ##s in infection spread , epidemic potential , and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries . methods an age - st ##rat ##ified deter ##mini ##stic mathematical model that describes sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population ≥ ##1 million . results assuming worst - case scenario for the pan ##de ##mic , the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic tr ##aj ##ect ##ories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age . in the african region ( median age : 18 . 9 years ) , the median r ##0 was 1 . 05 versus 2 . 05 in the european region ( median age : 41 . 7 years ) , and the median ( per 100 persons ) for the infections rate was 22 . 5 ( versus 69 . 0 ) , for severe and / or critical disease cases rate was 3 . 3 ( versus 13 . 0 ) , and for death rate was 0 . 5 ( versus 3 . 9 ) . conclusions age could be a driver of variable sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic tr ##aj ##ect ##ories worldwide . countries with sizable adult and / or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemic ##s in absence of interventions . meanwhile , countries with predominantly younger age co ##hort ##s may experience smaller and slower epidemic ##s . these predictions , however , should not lead to com ##pl ##ace ##ncy , as the pan ##de ##mic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere .  
background . the extent of spread of sar ##s corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in the uk and elsewhere is unknown because typically only sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals are diagnosed . we performed a ser ##ological study of recent blood donors in scotland to detect antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as a marker of past infection . methods . a pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##isation ass ##ay was used to detect neutral ##ising antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in scotland during march , 2020 . controls were collected from 100 donors in scotland during 2019 . findings . all samples collected on the 17th march , 2020 ( n = 500 ) were negative in the pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##isation ass ##ay . neutral ##ising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd march ; one further sample was reactive in an anti - spike elisa . interpretation . although we cannot use the rise in numbers ser ##op ##osi ##tive to in ##fer the contemporary ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce or the growth rate of the epidemic , we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - associated deaths reported in that time period in scotland , given that ser ##oco ##n ##version takes up to 2 - 3 weeks . it should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population ; in particular , those with a history of recent respiratory infections are def ##erre ##d . finally , it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals ser ##oco ##n ##vert and become reactive in the ass ##ays used . serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and ser ##oco ##n ##version in this and other similar populations however , these data indicate that ser ##o - surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak .  
the emerge ##nt corona ##virus , designated severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , is a zoo ##not ##ic pathogen that has demonstrated remarkable trans ##mis ##sibility in the human population and is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of a current global pan ##de ##mic called co ##vid - 19 . we measured the dynamic ( short - term ) aero ##sol e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and compared the e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies with two other emerging corona ##virus ##es , sar ##s - co ##v ( emerged in 2002 ) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ; emerged starting in 2012 ) . we also quan ##ti ##fied the long - term persistence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its ability to maintain in ##fect ##ivity when suspended in aero ##sol ##s for up to 16 hours .  
summary ##ant ##iv ##ira ##l treatments targeting the emerging corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) are urgently required . we screened a panel of already - approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and identified two new anti ##vira ##l agents : the hiv pro ##tea ##se inhibitor ne ##lf ##ina ##vir and the anti - inflammatory drug ce ##pha ##rant ##hine . in si ##lic ##o modeling shows ne ##lf ##ina ##vir binds the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se consistent with its inhibition of viral replication , whilst ce ##pha ##rant ##hine inhibit ##s viral attachment and entry into cells . consistent with their different modes of action , in vitro ass ##ays highlight a syn ##er ##gist ##ic effect of this combined treatment to limit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proliferation . mathematical modeling in vitro anti ##vira ##l activity coupled with the known ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic ##s for these drugs predict ##s that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir will facilitate viral clearance . combining ne ##lf ##ina ##vir / ce ##pha ##rant ##hine enhanced their predicted efficacy to control viral proliferation , to am ##eli ##ora ##te both the progression of disease and risk of transmission . in summary , this study identifies a new multi ##dr ##ug combination treatment for co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract ##int ##rod ##uc ##tion ##co ##vid - 19 , is caused by a new strain of corona ##virus called sar ##s - corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which is a positive sense single strand rna virus . in humans , it binds to ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) with the help a structure on its surface called the s - spike . co ##vid - 19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinic ##ians . the pathogen ##esis of gi symptoms , diabetes - associated mortality , and disease rec ##ur ##rence in co ##vid - 19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases . tissue specific variation of ace ##2 expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logical basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms . materials and methods ##the data were downloaded from the human protein atlas available at ( https : / / www . protein ##at ##las . org / search / ace ##2 ) and the tissue specific expression ( both mrna and protein ) of ace ##2 as yielded from the studies with rna sequencing and im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry ( i ##hc ) was analyzed as a function of the various components of the digest ##ive tract . a digest ##ive system specific functional enrichment map of ace ##2 gene was created using g : profile ##r ( https : / / bi ##it . cs . ut . ee / gp ##ro ##fi ##ler / go ##st ) utility and the data were visual ##ized using cy ##tos ##cape software , version 3 . 7 . 2 ( https : / / cy ##tos ##cape . org / ) . results ##the correlated expression ( gen ##omic and pro ##te ##omic ) of ace ##2 ( to which sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binds through the s - spike ) was found to be enriched in the lower gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract ( gi ##t ) ( highest in small int ##est ##ine , followed by colon and rec ##tum ) , and was und ##ete ##ctable in the upper gi ##t components : mouth cavity ( tongue , oral mu ##cos ##a , and saliva ##ry glands ) , es ##op ##ha ##gus , and stomach . high expression of ace ##2 was noted in the gland ##ular cells as well as in the enter ##ocytes in the lining ep ##ith ##eli ##um ( including brush border ep ##ith ##eli ##um ) . among other digest ##ive system organs , gall ##bla ##dder ( gb ) showed high expression of ace ##2 in gland ##ular cells , while any protein expression was und ##ete ##ctable in liver and pan ##cre ##as . conclusions ##base ##d on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose that a sar ##s -
the world health organization characterized the co ##vid - 19 as a pan ##de ##mic in march 2020 , the second pan ##de ##mic of the 21st century . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is a positive - stranded rna beta ##cor ##ona ##virus of the family corona ##vir ##idae . expanding virus populations , as that of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , accumulate a number of narrowly shared poly ##morphism ##s imposing a con ##fo ##und ##ing effect on traditional cluster ##ing methods . in this context , approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 population are necessary for a robust cluster ##ing . here , we proposed the subdivision of the global sar ##s - co ##v - 2 population into sixteen well - defined sub ##type ##s by focusing on the widely shared poly ##morphism ##s in non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural ( ns ##p ##3 , ns ##p ##4 , ns ##p ##6 , ns ##p ##12 , ns ##p ##13 and ns ##p ##14 ) cis ##tron ##s , structural ( spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ) and accessory ( or ##f ##8 ) genes . six virus sub ##type ##s were predominant in the population , but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have ph ##eno ##typic implications . we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize that the virus sub ##type ##s detected in this study are records of the early stages of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 divers ##ification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world , a typical founder effect . the genetic structure determined for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 population provides substantial guidelines for maxim ##izing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat . here ##in , we report that the fda - approved gold drug , aura ##no ##fin , inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication in human cells at low micro mo ##lar concentration . treatment of cells with aura ##no ##fin resulted in a 95 % reduction in the viral rna at 48 hours after infection . aura ##no ##fin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - induced cy ##tok ##ines in human cells . these data indicate that aura ##no ##fin could be a useful drug to limit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and associated lung injury due to its anti - viral , anti - inflammatory and anti - ro ##s properties . aura ##no ##fin has a well - known toxicity profile and is considered safe for human use .

abstract ##int ##rod ##uc ##tion ##a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was recently identified as the pathogen responsible for the co ##vid - 19 outbreak . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 triggers severe pneumonia , which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases . as reported , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is 80 % genetically identical to the 2003 sar ##s - co ##v virus . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 into human cells . ace ##2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type ii al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells , where it positively mod ##ulates the ras system that regulates blood flow , pressure , and fluid home ##osta ##sis . thus , virus - induced reduction of ace ##2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure . ch ##rom ##atin re ##mo ##dell ##ing plays a significant role in the regulation of ace ##2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome . methods ##her ##e , we integrated data on physical ch ##rom ##atin interactions within the genome organization ( captured by hi - c ) with tissue - specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait lo ##ci ( e ##q ##tl ##s ) and thus regulatory elements located within the ace ##2 gene . results ##we identified regulatory elements within ace ##2 that control the expression of pi ##r , ca ##5 ##b , and vs ##p ##13 ##c in the lung . the gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses , de novo p ##yr ##imi ##dine and poly ##amine synthesis , and the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum , respectively . conclusion ##our study , although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is put ##ative until proven by targeted experiments , supports the hypothesis that viral si ##len ##cing of ace ##2 alter ##s the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra - cellular environment suitable for viral replication .  
abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has spread across more than 200 countries and regions , leading to an unprecedented medical burden and live lost . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific anti ##vira ##ls or prop ##hyl ##actic vaccines are not available . neutral ##izing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are a promising category of biological the ##ra ##pies . using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike rb ##d as a bait , we have discovered a panel of human ##ized single domain antibodies ( sd ##ab ##s ) . these sd ##ab ##s revealed binding kinetic ##s with the equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant ( k ##d ) of 0 . 7 ~ 33 nm . the mono ##meric sd ##ab ##s showed half maximal inhibitor ##y concentration ( ic ##50 ) of 0 . 00 ##3 ~ 0 . 3 μ ##g / ml in pseudo ##type ##d particle neutral ##ization ass ##ay , and 0 . 23 ~ 0 . 50 μ ##g / ml in authentic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 neutral ##ization ass ##ay . competitive ligand - binding data suggested that the sd ##ab ##s either completely blocked or significantly inhibit ##ed the association between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d and viral entry receptor ace ##2 . finally , we showed that fusion of the human i ##gg ##1 fc to sd ##ab ##s improved their neutral ##ization activity by tens of times . these results reveal the novel sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rb ##d targeting sd ##ab ##s and pa ##ve a road for antibody drug development .  
background . more than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) have been confirmed . while pc ##r - based ass ##ays are used for diagnosis , high through - put ser ##olo ##gic methods are needed to detect antibodies for ser ##ose ##r ##ve ##illa ##nce and for identification of ser ##oco ##n ##version , potential plasma donors , and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen . methods . a lu ##mine ##x binding ass ##ay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from co ##vid - 19 - infected and - un ##in ##fect ##ed individuals specific for two rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . findings . flu ##oro ##chrome - labeled beads were coated with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt soluble stabilized trim ##eric sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein ec ##to ##dom ##ain or its central portion , the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) . coated beads were inc ##uba ##ted with sera , followed by inc ##uba ##tion with bio ##tin ##yla ##ted anti - human total i ##g antibodies and ph ##y ##coe ##ry ##th ##rin ( pe ) - labeled st ##re ##pta ##vid ##in . read ##out using a lu ##mine ##x analyze ##r clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and un ##in ##fect ##ed subject , del ##ine ##ating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects . interpretation . antibody ass ##ays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and have ser ##oco ##n ##verted , as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered . the use of the lu ##mine ##x binding ab ass ##ay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2 . 5 hours , uses very little antigen , and permits a high through - put of samples / day . funding . ni ##aid contracts and grants , department of veterans affairs grants , the micro ##biology laboratory clinical services , translation ##al science hub , and personal ##ized vi ##rol ##ogy initiative , and department of medicine of mount sinai health system and ic ##ah ##n school of medicine at mount sinai .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 and is a severe threat to global health . patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 show a wide range of symptoms and disease severity , while limited data is available on its im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . here , the kinetic ##s of the development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific antibody responses in relation to clinical features and dynamics of specific b - cell populations are reported . im ##mun ##op ##hen ##ot ##yp ##ing of b cells was performed by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry with longitudinal ##ly collected p ##bm ##cs . in parallel , serum samples were analyzed for the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific i ##ga , i ##gg , and i ##gm antibodies using whole pro ##te ##ome peptide micro ##ar ##ray ##s . soon after disease onset in a mild case , we observed an increased frequency of plasma ##bla ##sts con ##com ##itan ##tly with a strong sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific i ##ga response . in contrast , a case with more severe progression showed a delayed , but eventually very strong and broad sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific i ##ga response . this case study shows that determining sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific antibody ep ##ito ##pes can be valuable to monitor the specific ##ity and magnitude of the early b - cell response , which could guide the development of vaccine candidates . follow - up studies are required to evaluate whether the kinetic ##s and strength of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific i ##ga response could be potential pro ##gno ##stic markers of viral control .  
the sudden outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has spread globally with more than 1 , 300 , 000 patients diagnosed and a death toll of 70 , 000 . current gen ##omic survey data suggest that single nu ##cle ##otide variants ( s ##n ##vs ) are abundant . however , no mutation has been directly linked with functional changes in viral pathogen ##ici ##ty . here we report functional characterization ##s of 11 patient - derived viral isolate ##s , all of which have at least one mutation . importantly , these viral isolate ##s show significant variation in cy ##top ##athic effects and viral load , up to 270 - fold differences , when in ##fect ##ing ve ##ro - e ##6 cells . we observed intra ##personal variation and 6 different mutations in the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s protein ) , including 2 different s ##n ##vs that led to the same miss ##ense mutation . therefore , we provide direct evidence that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogen ##ici ##ty .  
this manuscript is based on the a simple but robust model we developed urgently to accurately monitor and predict viral dynamics for each sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected patient , given the limited number of rt - pc ##r tests and the complexity of each individual ' s physical health situation . in this study , we used the mathematical model to monitor and predict the changes of viral loads from different nasal and throat sw ##ab of clinical specimens collected from diagnosed patients . we also tested our real time model by using the data from the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected patients with different severity . by using this personal model , we can predict the viral dynamics of patients , minimize false - negative test results , and screen the patients who are at risk of testing positive again after recovery . we sincerely thank those who are on the front lines battling sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . we hope this model will be useful for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected patients .  
the duration and nature of immunity generated in response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is unknown . many public health responses and modeled scenarios for co ##vid - 19 outbreak ##s caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time . the times ##cal ##e of protection is a critical deter ##mina ##nt of the future impact of the pathogen . the presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or va ##cci ##nation ( when available ) will affect future transmission and illness severity . the dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of con ##vale ##scent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity . here , we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to corona ##virus ##es , including sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as well as the related sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , mer ##s - co ##v and human endemic corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) . we reviewed 128 ##1 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus : 1 ) antibody kinetic ##s , 2 ) co ##rre ##lates of protection , 3 ) im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ogen ##esis , 4 ) antigen ##ic diversity and cross - react ##ivity , and 5 ) population ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce . while studies of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it , evidence from other corona ##virus ##es can provide clues and guide future research .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 is known to in ##fect the neurological , respiratory , enter ##ic , and he ##pati ##c systems of human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system . co ##vid - 19 , the most serious public condition caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes . una ##va ##ila ##bility of specific therapeutic ##s or approved vaccine has made the recovery of co ##vi - 19 more troubles ##ome and challenging . the present in si ##lic ##o study aimed to predict a novel chi ##meric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of corona ##virus ##es . conserved regions from the homo ##log ##ous protein sets of spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) , membrane protein ( m ) , envelope protein and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) were identified through multiple sequence alignment . the ph ##yl ##ogen ##y analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins ( s , e , m and n ) reflected the close ancestral relation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to sar ##s - co ##v - 1 and bat corona ##virus . numerous im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes ( both t cell and b cell ) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigen ##ici ##ty , trans ##me ##mb ##rane topology , con ##ser ##van ##cy level , toxicity and all ##er ##genic ##ity pattern and population coverage analysis . top put ##ative ep ##ito ##pes were combined with appropriate ad ##ju ##vant ##s and link ##ers to construct a novel multi ##ep ##ito ##pe subunit vaccine against co ##vid - 19 . the designed construct ##s were characterized based on ph ##ys ##ico ##chemical properties , all ##er ##genic ##ity , antigen ##ici ##ty and sol ##ub ##ility which revealed the superiority of construct v ##3 in terms safety and efficacy . essential molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis confirmed minimal def ##or ##ma ##bility of the refined model at molecular level . in addition , di ##sul ##fide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein . molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct v ##3 and h ##la cells , as well as with different host receptors . micro ##bial expression and translation ##al efficacy of the construct ##s were checked using pet ##28 ##a ( + ) vector of e . coli strain k ##12 . the development of prevent ##ive measures to combat co ##vid - 19 infections might be aided the present study . however , the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data .  
abstract ##co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has resulted so far 14 , 395 , 16 confirmed cases with 85 , 71 ##1 deaths from the 212 countries , or territories . due to multi ##face ##t issues and challenges in implementation of the safety & prevent ##ive measures , inconsistent coordination between societies - governments and most import ##an ##ly lack of specific vaccine to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the spread of wu ##han originated virus is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life . in the present study , we mapped several im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes ( b - cell , t - cell , and if ##n - gamma ) over the entire structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and by applying various computational and im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics approaches , we designed a multi - ep ##ito ##pe peptide based vaccine that predicted high im ##mun ##ogenic response in the largest proportion of world ’ s human population . to ensure high expression of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine in e . coli , cod ##on optimization and in - si ##lic ##o cl ##oning were also carried out . the designed vaccine with high molecular affinity to t ##lr ##3 and t ##lr ##4 , was found capable to initiate effective innate and adaptive immune response . the immune simulation also suggested uprising high levels of both b - cell and t - cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared antigen from the system . the proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence , should be tested by practical experimentation ##s for its functioning and efficacy to neutral ##ize sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##in december 2019 , a novel corona ##virus named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 first reported in wu ##han , china , emerged and rapidly spread to numerous other countries globally , causing the current pan ##de ##mic . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract ( co ##vid - 19 ) that can result in severe disease and lethal ##ity . currently , there is no approved anti ##vira ##l drug for treating co ##vid - 19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies and vaccines . in order for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to enter cells , its surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein spike ( s ) must be cl ##ea ##ved at two different sites by host cell pro ##tea ##ses , which therefore represent potential drug targets . in the present study we investigated which host cell pro ##tea ##ses activate the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein in cal ##u - 3 human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . we show that s can be cl ##ea ##ved by both the prop ##rot ##ein convert ##ase fur ##in at the s ##1 / s ##2 site and the trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) at the s ##2 ’ site . we demonstrate that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 is essential for activation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s in cal ##u - 3 cells through anti ##sen ##se - mediated knock ##down of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 expression . further , we show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication can be efficiently inhibit ##ed by two synthetic inhibitors of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and also by the broad range ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se inhibitor apr ##ot ##ini ##n . additionally , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication was also strongly inhibit ##ed by the synthetic fur ##in inhibitor mi - 1851 . combining various t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 inhibitors with mi - 1851 produced more potent anti ##vira ##l activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 than an e ##qui ##mo ##lar amount of any single ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se inhibitor . in contrast , inhibition of end ##osomal cat ##he ##ps ##ins by e ##64 ##d did not affect virus replication . our data demonstrate that both t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and fur ##in are essential for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 activation in human air ##way cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of co ##vid - 19 either by targeting one of these pro ##tea ##ses alone or by a combination of fur ##in and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 inhibitors . therefore , this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
background : effective therapeutic ##s to treat co ##vid - 19 are urgently needed . re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir is a nu ##cle ##otide pro ##dr ##ug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against corona ##virus ##es . here , we tested the efficacy of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment in a r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods : to evaluate the effect of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 disease outcome , we used the recently established r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease . two groups of six r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues were infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and treated with intra ##ven ##ous re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily . clinical , vi ##rol ##ogical and his ##to ##logical parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at nec ##rop ##sy to determine treatment efficacy . results : in contrast to vehicle - treated animals , animals treated with re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrate ##s on radio ##graphs . virus ti ##ters in bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ges were significantly reduced as early as 12 ##hr ##s after the first treatment was administered . at nec ##rop ##sy on day 7 after in ##oc ##ulation , lung viral loads of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir - treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue . conclusions : therapeutic re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues . these data support early re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment initiation in co ##vid - 19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia .

in previous communications , we have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized the possibility that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus could be present on part ##iculate matter ( pm ) during the spreading of the infection , consistently with evidence already available for other viruses . here , we present the first results of the analyses that we have performed on 34 pm ##10 samples of outdoor / airborne pm ##10 from an industrial site of berg ##amo province , collected with two different air sample ##rs over a continuous 3 - weeks period , from february 21st to march 13th . we can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral rna by detecting highly specific rt ##dr gene on 8 filters in two parallel pc ##r analyses . this is the first preliminary evidence that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna can be present on outdoor part ##iculate matter , thus suggesting that , in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of pm , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could create clusters with outdoor pm and , by reducing their diffusion coefficient , enhance the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere . further confirmation ##s of this preliminary evidence are ongoing , and should include real - time assessment about the vital ##ity of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as well as its vi ##ru ##lence when ads ##or ##bed on part ##iculate matter . at the present , no assumptions can be made concerning the correlation between the presence of the virus on pm and co ##vid - 19 outbreak progression . other issues to be specifically addressed are the average concentrations of pm eventually required for a potential boost effect of the con ##tag ##ion ( in case it is confirmed that pm might act as a carrier for the viral drop ##let nuclei ) , or even the theo ##ret ##ic possibility of im ##mun ##ization con ##se ##quent to minimal dose exposure ##s at lower threshold ##s of pm .  
background : the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic caused > 1 million infections during january - march 2020 . there is an urgent need for robust antibody detection approaches to support diagnostic ##s , vaccine development , safe individual release from qu ##aran ##tine and population lock - down exit strategies . the early promise of lateral flow im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y ( l ##fia ) devices has been questioned following concerns about sensitivity and specific ##ity . methods : we used a panel of plasma samples designated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 positive ( from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r - positive individuals ; n = 40 ) and negative ( samples bank ##ed in the uk prior to december - 2019 ( n = 142 ) ) . we tested plasma for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies by elisa and using nine different commercially available l ##fia devices . results : elisa detected sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm or i ##gg in 34 / 40 individuals with an rt - pc ##r - confirmed diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ( sensitivity 85 % , 95 % ci 70 - 94 % ) , vs 0 / 50 pre - pan ##de ##mic controls ( specific ##ity 100 % [ 95 % ci 93 - 100 % ] ) . i ##gg levels were detected in 31 / 31 rt - pc ##r - positive individuals tested ≥ ##10 days after sy ##mpt ##om onset ( sensitivity 100 % , 95 % ci 89 - 100 % ) . i ##gg ti ##tres rose during the 3 weeks post sy ##mpt ##om onset and began to fall by 8 weeks , but remained above the detection threshold . point estimates for the sensitivity of l ##fia devices ranged from 55 - 70 % versus rt - pc ##r and 65 - 85 % versus elisa , with specific ##ity 95 - 100 % and 93 - 100 % respectively . within the limits of the study size , the performance of most l ##fia devices was similar . conclusions : the performance of current l ##fia devices is inadequate for most individual patient applications . elisa can be cal ##ib ##rated to be specific for detecting and quan ##tify ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg and is highly sensitive for i ##gg from 10 days following symptoms onset .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has recently been detected in fe ##ces , which indicates that wastewater may be used to monitor viral prevalence in the community . here we use two different sampling methods to monitor sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wastewater over a 17 - day period and sequencing is used to in ##fer viral ancestry . while sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is detected over the entire time course , viral rna has been steadily decreasing over the last week , suggesting that state mandated social isolation is having a me ##asurable impact on containment of the outbreak .

abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 and all other corona ##virus ##es express its 3 prime genes by forming sub - gen ##omic rna . as the genome of these virus exist in rna form , only by prof ##iling the relative abundance of these sg ##rna ##s , can the viral transcript ##ome be revealed . utilizing public ##ally available meta - transcript ##omic data generated from patient samples , we were able to in ##fer the viral transcript ##ome in vivo , which is distinct from the in vitro one derived from cell culture . inter - sample diversity was also observed and a sample specific transcript was identified . by doing the same analysis to mer ##s and sar ##s data , we were able to compare the three in terms of transcription . among the differences , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has significantly elevated expression of the spike gene , which may contribute to its high trans ##mis ##sibility . highlights ##the in vivo transcript ##ome of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 revealed by sg ##rna prof ##iling , for 25 patient samples around the globe . the spike protein expression is an order of magnitude higher in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 than mer ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v , possibly contributing to the virus ’ elevated trans ##mis ##sibility . the in vivo sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transcript ##ome ##s , as in ##fer ##red from human patient data was distinct from the in vitro one derived from cell line culture , all the accessory genes were up - regulated in vivo , suggesting intricate expression regulation mechanism for the small viral genome .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , a corona ##virus that newly emerged in china in late 2019 1 , 2 and spread rapidly worldwide , caused the first witnessed pan ##de ##mic sparked by a corona ##virus . as the pan ##de ##mic progresses , information about the modes of transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread . here we show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air ( via respiratory droplets and / or aero ##sol ##s ) between fe ##rret ##s . intra ##nas ##al in ##oc ##ulation of donor fe ##rret ##s resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long - term shed ##ding , up to 11 to 19 days post - in ##oc ##ulation . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact fe ##rret ##s between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient fe ##rret ##s between 3 and 7 days after exposure . the pattern of virus shed ##ding in the direct contact and indirect recipient fe ##rret ##s was similar to that of the in ##oc ##ulated fe ##rret ##s and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals , showing that fe ##rret ##s were productive ##ly infected via either route . this study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 via the air , supporting the implementation of community - level social di ##stan ##cing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings 3 .  
abstract ##the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the cause of corona ##virus disease - 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . the main receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , ang ##iot ##ens ##in i converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species . here , we utilized a unique data ##set of 410 ve ##rte ##brates , including 252 mammals , to study cross - species conservation of ace ##2 and its likelihood to function as a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor . we designed a five - category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus , classify ##ing all species from very high to very low . only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories , and only cat ##ar ##rh ##ine primate ##s in the very high category , suggesting that they are at high risk for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . we employed a protein structural analysis to qu ##ali ##tative ##ly assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ace ##2 / sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binding , and found the number of predicted un ##fa ##vor ##able changes significantly correlated with the binding score . extending this analysis to human population data , we found only rare ( < 0 . 1 % ) variants in 10 / 25 binding sites . in addition , we observed evidence of positive selection in ace ##2 in multiple species , including bats . utilized appropriately , our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , justify the selection of animal models of co ##vid - 19 , and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care .  
abstract ##the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has resulted in a global health and economic crisis of unprecedented scale . the high trans ##mis ##sibility of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes , urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures . here , we report the generation of synthetic nano ##bo ##dies , known as sy ##bo ##dies , against the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in an ex ##ped ##iti ##ous process taking only twelve working days , sy ##bo ##dies were selected entirely in vitro from three large comb ##inator ##ial libraries , using rib ##oso ##me and ph ##age display . we obtained six strongly enriched sy ##body pools against the isolated rb ##d and identified 63 unique anti - rb ##d sy ##bo ##dies which also interact in the context of the full - length sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein . it is anticipated that compact bind ##ers such as these sy ##bo ##dies could fe ##asi ##bly be developed into an in ##hala ##ble drug that can be used as a convenient prop ##hyl ##ax ##is against co ##vid - 19 . moreover , generation of poly ##valent anti ##vira ##ls , via fusion of anti - rb ##d sy ##bo ##dies to additional small bind ##ers recognizing secondary ep ##ito ##pes , could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants . we present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sy ##bo ##dies , as a freely accessible resource . this report will be updated as we further character ##ize the identified sy ##bo ##dies , in terms of af ##fin ##ities , scaled - up purification yields , and their potential to neutral ##ize sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections .  
abstract ##the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 has caused serious epidemic events in china and other countries . with the rapid spread of co ##vid - 19 , it is urgent to explore the pathogen ##esis of this novel corona ##virus . however , the foundation ##al research of co ##vid - 19 is very weak . although ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the reported receptor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , information about sar ##s - co ##v - 2 invading air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells is very limited . based on the analysis of the human protein atlas database , we compared the virus - related receptors of ep ##ith ##elial - derived cells from different organs and found potential key molecules in the local micro ##en ##vir ##on ##ment for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entering air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells . in addition , we found that these proteins were associated with virus reactive proteins in host air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cells , which may promote the activation of the immune system and the release of inflammatory factors . our findings provide a new research direction for understanding the potential micro ##en ##vir ##on ##ment required by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in air ##way ep ##ith ##elial , which may assist in the discovery of potential drug targets against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
a novel corona ##virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the cause of the ongoing co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . in this study , we performed a comprehensive ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and gen ##omic analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s from ten patients in sha ##ox ##ing , a mid - sized city outside of the epic ##enter hub ##ei province , china , during the early stage of the outbreak ( late january to early february , 2020 ) . we obtained viral genome ##s with > 99 % coverage and a mean depth of 296 ##x demonstrating that viral gen ##omic analysis is feasible via meta ##gen ##omics sequencing directly on nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al samples with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 real - time pc ##r ct values less than 28 . we found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to hub ##ei shared the exact same virus with patients from wu ##han , taiwan , belgium and australia , highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe . the virus from another cluster of husband and wife without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of hub ##ei accumulated significantly more mutations ( 9 s ##np ##s vs average 4 s ##np ##s ) , suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak . we also found 70 % patients in this study had the s gen ##otype , consistent with an early study showing a higher prevalence of s gen ##otype out of hub ##ei than that inside hub ##ei . we calculated an average mutation rate of 1 . 37 ##x ##10 - 3 nu ##cle ##otide substitution per site per year , which is similar to that of other corona ##virus ##es . our findings add to the growing knowledge of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and gen ##omic characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that are important for guiding outbreak containment and vaccine development . the moderate mutation rate of this virus also lend ##s hope that development of an effective , long - lasting vaccine may be possible .  
background : the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has rapidly spread globally . the laboratory diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection has relied on nuclei ##c acid tests . however , there are many limitations of nuclei ##c acid tests , including low through ##put and high rates of false negative ##s . more sensitive and accurate tests to effectively identify infected patients are needed . methods : this study has developed fully automated che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cent im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys ( cl ##ia ) to determine i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in human serum . the ass ##ay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals . clinical specific ##ity was evaluated by measuring 97 ##2 hospitalized patients with diseases other than co ##vid - 19 , and 58 ##6 donors of a normal population . clinical sensitivity was assessed on 50 ##3 confirmed cases of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by rt - pc ##r and 52 suspected cases . results : the ass ##ays demonstrated satisfied ass ##ay precision with coefficient of variation ( cv ) of less than 4 . 45 % . ina ##ct ##ivation of specimen does not affect ass ##ay measurement . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm shows clinical specific ##ity of 97 . 33 % and 99 . 49 % for hospitalized patients and normal population respectively . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gg shows clinical specific ##ity of 97 . 43 % and 99 . 15 % for the hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg show clinical sensitivity of 85 . 88 % and 96 . 62 % respectively for confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection with rt - pc ##r , of 73 . 08 % and 86 . 54 % respectively for suspected cases . conclusions : we have developed fully automated im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys for detecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies in human serum . the ass ##ays demonstrated high clinical specific ##ity and sensitivity , and add great value to nuclei ##c acid testing in fighting against the global pan ##de ##mic of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
background : the role of aero ##sol ##s in the transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 remains debated . we anal ##yse ##d an outbreak involving three non - associated families in restaurant x in guangzhou , china , and assessed the possibility of aero ##sol transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and character ##ize the associated environmental conditions . methods : we collected ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data , obtained a video record and a patron seating - arrangement from the restaurant , and measured the di ##sper ##sion of a warm trace ##r gas as a sur ##rogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient . computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets . we compared the in - room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus - laden aero ##sol trace ##r . the ventilation rate was measured using the trace ##r decay method . results : three families ( a , b , c ) , 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at this time , or previously , ate lunch at restaurant x on chinese new year ' s eve ( january 24 , 2020 ) at three neighboring tables . subsequently , three members of family b and two members of family c became infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , whereas none of the waiter ##s or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected . during this occasion , the ventilation rate was 0 . 75 - 1 . 04 l / s per person . no close contact or f ##omi ##te contact was observed , aside from back - to - back sitting by some patrons . our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus - laden aero ##sol ##s . conclusions : aero ##sol transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of co ##vid - 19 .  
rapid and accurate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . the current gold standard for co ##vid - 19 diagnosis is real - time rt - pc ##r detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . low sensitivity , exposure risks to healthcare workers , and global shortages of sw ##ab ##s and personal protective equipment , however , nec ##ess ##itate the validation of new diagnostic approaches . saliva is a promising candidate for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnostic ##s because ( 1 ) collection is minimal ##ly invasive and can re ##lia ##bly be self - administered and ( 2 ) saliva has exhibited comparable sensitivity to nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s in detection of other respiratory pathogen ##s , including endemic human corona ##virus ##es , in previous studies . to valid ##ate the use of saliva for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection , we tested nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and saliva samples from confirmed co ##vid - 19 patients and self - collected samples from healthcare workers on co ##vid - 19 wards . when we compared sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection from patient - matched nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and saliva samples , we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection . furthermore , we report less variability in self - sample collection of saliva . taken together , our findings demonstrate that saliva is a viable and more sensitive alternative to nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s and could enable at - home self - administered sample collection for accurate large - scale sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing .  
abstract the recently emerged pathogen ##ic sar ##s - corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has spread rapidly , leading to a global pan ##de ##mic . identification of risk factors for mor ##bid ##ity and cellular core ##ce ##pt ##ors for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry is thus urgently needed . in this study , we performed a retrospective study involving 86 ##1 patients with co ##vid - 19 from a single - center classified as mild , moderate , severe or critical and found that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection was associated with clinical ##ly significant lower levels of cho ##les ##terol . the levels of both tc and hd ##l were inverse ##ly associated with the severity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . in addition , in patients with severe disease , a significant increase in the serum hd ##l level was correlated with good outcomes . we also showed that a clinical ##ly approved hd ##lr antagonist inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pseudo ##virus infection . notably , sar ##s - 2 - s bound to cho ##les ##terol . our results not only identify the hd ##l level as a pro ##gno ##stic marker for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection but also indicate a potential target for anti ##vira ##l intervention .  
the ongoing pan ##de ##mic spread of a novel human corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , associated with severe pneumonia disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , has resulted in the generation of thousands of virus genome sequences . the rate of genome generation is unprecedented , yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineage ##s that contribute most to active spread . our system is made tract ##able by con ##stra ##ining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flag ##ging and dec ##lass ##ifying virus lineage ##s that become uno ##bs ##erved and hence are likely inactive . by focusing on active virus lineage ##s and those spreading to new locations this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and deter ##mina ##nts of the global spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome , known as corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) has spread so much rapidly and severely to induce world health organization ( who ) to declare state of emergency over the new corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . while several countries have chosen the almost complete lock - down for slowing down sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spread , scientific community is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment of the dangerous co ##vid - 19 . with this aim we performed an in si ##lic ##o comparative modeling analysis , which allows to gain new insights about the main conform ##ation ##al changes occurring in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein , at the level of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) , along interactions with human cells ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor , that favour human cell invasion . furthermore , our analysis provides i ) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike rb ##d , for preventing interactions with the human ace ##2 , and ii ) instructions for building new possible neutral ##izing antibodies , according to chemical / physical space restraints and complementary determining regions ( cd ##r ) mu ##tage ##nes ##is of the identified existing antibodies . the proposed antibodies show in si ##lic ##o a high affinity for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike rb ##d and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high affinity antibodies against present and future corona ##virus able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ace ##2 . more in general , our analysis provides indications for the set - up of the right biological molecular context for investigating spike rb ##d - ace ##2 interactions for the development of new vaccines , diagnosis kits and other treatments based on the usage or the targeting of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein .  
abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has resulted in a pan ##de ##mic and continues to spread quickly around the globe . currently , no effective vaccine is available to prevent co ##vid - 19 and an intense global development activity is in progress . in this context , the different technology platforms face several challenges resulting from the involvement of a new virus still not fully characterised . finding of the right conditions for virus amp ##li ##fication for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or at ##ten ##uated whole viral particles is among them . here , we describe the establishment of a work ##flow based on shotgun tandem mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry data to guide the opt ##imi ##sation of the conditions for viral amp ##li ##fication . in parallel , we anal ##yse ##d the dynamic of the host cell pro ##te ##ome following sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection providing a global overview of biological processes mod ##ulated by the virus and that could be further explored to identify drug targets to address the pan ##de ##mic .  
the co ##vid - 19 caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has brought about an unprecedented crisis , taking a heavy toll on human health , lives as well as the global economy . there are no sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus . hence , rapid development of effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is urgently needed . here we developed a pilot - scale production of a pu ##rified inactivated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus vaccine candidate ( pic ##ova ##cc ) , which induced sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific neutral ##izing antibodies in mice , rats and non - human primate ##s . these antibodies potent ##ly neutral ##ized 10 representative sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains , indicative of a possible broader neutral ##izing ability against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains circulating worldwide . im ##mun ##ization with two different doses ( 3 μ ##g or 6 μ ##g per dose ) provided partial or complete protection in mac ##aq ##ues against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 challenge , respectively , without any antibody - dependent enhancement of infection . systematic evaluation of pic ##ova ##cc via monitoring clinical signs , hem ##ato ##logical and bio ##chemical index , and his ##top ##hat ##hol ##ogical analysis in mac ##aq ##ues suggests that it is safe . these data support the rapid clinical development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccines for humans .  
abstract ##the ongoing co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic is caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . age , smoking , obesity , and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in co ##vid - 19 . obesity and diabetes are usually associated with d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated lip ##id synthesis and clearance which can initiate or ag ##gra ##vate pulmonary inflammation and injury . it has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 utilizes the ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptors present on the cells . we aimed to character ##ize how sar ##s - co ##v - 2 d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ates lip ##id metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated lip ##ogen ##esis on the regulation of ace ##2 , specifically in obesity . in our study , through the re - analysis of publicly available transcript ##omic data , we first found that lung ep ##ith ##elial cells infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 showed up ##re ##gul ##ation of genes associated with lip ##id metabolism , including the soc ##3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of le ##pt ##in signaling . this is of interest as viruses may hi ##jack host lip ##id metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles . furthermore , a mouse model of diet - induced obesity showed a significant increase in ace ##2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for ste ##rol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 ( sr ##eb ##p ) . suppression of sr ##eb ##p ##1 showed a significant increase in ace ##2 expression in the lung . together our results suggest that the d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ated lip ##ogen ##esis and the subsequently high ace ##2 expression in obe ##se patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##over the past several decades , multiple corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have emerged as highly infectious , lethal viruses in humans , most notably in the pan ##de ##mic outbreak of co ##vid - 19 , the disease caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . to date , there are no known therapeutic or prevent ##ative agents to target co ##vs . though age and como ##rb ##idi ##ties severely increase case fatal ##ity rates , the host factors that influence resistance or su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection with highly pathogen ##ic human co ##vs are unknown . innate immune responses to co ##vs are initiated by recognition of double - stranded ( ds ) rna and induction of inter ##fer ##on , which turns on a gene expression program that inhibit ##s viral replication . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 conserve ##s an ad ##p - rib ##os ##yl ##hy ##dro ##lase domain previously shown to counter ##act innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) , a model co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v . here we show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection of cell lines , infected fe ##rret ##s , and a deceased patient ’ s lung consistently and striking ##ly d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ates the nico ##tina ##mide aden ##ine din ##uc ##le ##otide ( nad + ) gene set with respect to nad + synthesis and utilization . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 induce ##s a set of poly ( ad ##p - rib ##ose ) polymer ##ase ( par ##p ) family members ; these par ##ps include enzymes required for the innate immune response to m ##h ##v . further , we show that m ##h ##v infection induce ##s an attack on host cell nico ##tina ##mide aden ##ine din ##uc ##le ##otide ( nad + ) and nico ##tina ##mide aden ##ine din ##uc ##le ##otide phosphate ( nad ##p + ) . the data indicate that over ##ex ##press ##ion of a viral ##ly induced par ##p , par ##p ##10 , is sufficient to de ##press host cell nad metabolism and that nad + boost ##ing strategies differ in their efficacy to restore par ##p ##10 function . gene expression and ph ##arm ##aco ##logical data suggest that boost ##ing nad + through the nico ##tina ##mide and nico ##tina ##mide rib ##osi ##de kinase pathways may restore anti ##vira ##l par ##p functions to support innate immunity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , whereas par ##p ##1 , 2 inhibition may be less likely to restore anti ##vira ##l par ##p functions .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a member of the corona ##vir ##idae family and is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of the respiratory corona ##virus disease 2019 . the virus has spread rapidly around the world resulting in over two million cases and nearly 150 , 000 deaths as of april 17 , 2020 . since no treatments or vaccines are available to treat co ##vid - 19 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , respiratory complications derived from the infections have overwhelmed healthcare systems around the world . this virus is related to sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , the virus that caused the 2002 - 2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome . in january 2020 , the center for structural gen ##omics of infectious diseases implemented a structural gen ##omics pipeline to solve the structures of proteins essential for corona ##virus replication - transcription . here we show the first structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ns ##p ##10 - ns ##p ##16 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se complex with s - aden ##os ##yl ##met ##hi ##oni ##ne at a resolution of 1 . 8 a . this het ##ero ##dim ##er complex is essential for cap ##ping viral mrna transcript ##s for efficient translation and to evade immune surveillance .  
abstract ##the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the novel corona ##virus disease , co ##vid - 19 , has prompted concert ##ed efforts to find successful treatments . the ca ##usa ##tive virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , uses its spike ( s ) protein to gain entry into host cells . therefore , the s protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy . here , we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the s protein structure . based on a comprehensive structural analysis of s proteins from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and previous human corona ##virus ##es , we found that the proto ##mer state of s proteins is structurally flexible . without the presence of a stab ##ili ##zing beta sheet from another proto ##mer chain , two regions in the s ##2 domain and the hi ##nge connecting the s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s lose their secondary structures . interesting ##ly , the region in the s ##2 domain was previously identified as an im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant site in the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 s protein . we anti ##ci ##pate that the molecular details el ##uc ##ida ##ted here will assist in effective therapeutic development for co ##vid - 19 .  
on the 21st of february 2020 a resident of the municipality of vo , a small town near padua , died of pneumonia due to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . this was the first co ##vid - 19 death detected in italy since the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the chinese city of wu ##han , hub ##ei province . in response , the regional authorities imposed the lock ##down of the whole municipality for 14 days . we collected information on the demo ##graphy , clinical presentation , hospital ##ization , contact network and presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s for 85 . 9 % and 71 . 5 % of the population of vo at two consecutive time points . on the first survey , which was conducted around the time the town lock ##down started , we found a prevalence of infection of 2 . 6 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 2 . 1 - 3 . 3 % ) . on the second survey , which was conducted at the end of the lock ##down , we found a prevalence of 1 . 2 % ( 95 % ci 0 . 8 - 1 . 8 % ) . notably , 43 . 2 % ( 95 % ci 32 . 2 - 54 . 7 % ) of the confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections detected across the two surveys were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic . the mean serial interval was 6 . 9 days ( 95 % ci 2 . 6 - 13 . 4 ) . we found no statistical ##ly significant difference in the viral load ( as measured by genome equivalent ##s in ##fer ##red from cycle threshold data ) of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic versus as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections ( p - values 0 . 6 and 0 . 2 for e and rd ##rp genes , respectively , exact wilcox ##on - mann - whitney test ) . contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lock ##down or from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections living in the same household . this study sheds new light on the frequency of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and their in ##fect ##ivity ( as measured by the viral load ) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics , the duration of viral load detect ##ability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures .  
background sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the cause of an ongoing pan ##de ##mic with a projected 100 , 000 to 240 , 000 u . s . deaths . to date , documentation of his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic features in fatal cases of co ##vid - 19 has been limited due to small sample size and incomplete organ sampling . methods post - mort ##em examinations were performed on 12 fatal co ##vid - 19 cases in washington state during february - march 2020 . clinical and laboratory data were reviewed . tissue examination of all major organs was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy . the presence of viral rna in sampled tissues was tested by rt - pc ##r . results all 12 patients were older with significant pre ##ex ##ist ##ing como ##rb ##idi ##ties . the major pulmonary finding was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage in the acute and / or organizing phases with virus identified in type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes by electron microscopy . the kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular ep ##ith ##eli ##um , end ##oth ##eli ##um , and pod ##ocytes without significant inflammation . viral particles were also observed in the tr ##ache ##a and large int ##est ##ines . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##ytic my ##oca ##rdi ##tis . rt - pc ##r also detected viral rna in the sub ##car ##inal l ##ym ##ph nodes , liver , sp ##leen , and large int ##est ##ines . conclusion sar ##s - co ##v - 2 represents the third novel corona ##virus to cause widespread human disease since 2002 . similar to sar ##s and mer ##s , the primary pathology was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage with virus located in the p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . however , other major organs including the heart and kidney ##s may be susceptible to viral replication and damage leading to increased mortality in those with di ##sse ##minated disease . understanding the pathology of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 will be essential to design effective the ##ra ##pies .  
human corona ##virus ##es are known for their tr ##op ##ism for central nervous system and to be associated with neurological complications . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##my represent a major health issue and if respiratory symptoms are at the forefront , neurological symptoms should be expected . here we report the case of two patient that developed en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##ic symptoms with ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical impairment and path ##olo ##gic ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid features con ##com ##itan ##tly to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 documented infection . both patient recovered promptly without treatment . this report raises the question of central nervous system involvement in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and the need for investigation of ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical complications in infected patient .  
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused a rapidly un ##folding pan ##de ##mic , overwhelming health care systems worldwide ##1 . clinical manifestation ##s of corona - virus - disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) vary broadly , ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection to acute respiratory failure and death ##2 , yet the underlying physiological conditions and mechanisms for this high variability are still unknown . also , the role of host immune responses in viral clearance and its involvement in pathogen ##esis remains un ##res ##olved . for sar ##s - co ##v ( 2002 / 03 ) , however , cd ##4 + t cell responses are generally associated with positive outcomes ##3 , 4 , while cellular immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have not yet been investigated . here we describe an ass ##ay that allows direct detection and characterization of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) - reactive cd ##4 + t cells in peripheral blood . we demonstrate the presence of s - reactive cd ##4 + t cells in 83 % of co ##vid - 19 patients , as well as in 34 % of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ser ##one ##gative healthy donors , albeit at lower frequencies . striking ##ly , in co ##vid - 19 patients s - reactive cd ##4 + t cells equally targeted both n - terminal and c - terminal parts of s whereas in healthy donors s - reactive cd ##4 + t cells reacted almost exclusively to the ct ##er ##mina ##l part that is a ) characterized by higher homo ##logy to spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of human endemic common cold corona ##virus ##es , and b ) contains the s ##2 subunit of s with the cy ##top ##las ##mic peptide ( cp ) , the fusion peptide ( f ##p ) , and the trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain ( t ##m ) but not the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . s - reactive cd ##4 + t cells from co ##vid - 19 patients were further distinct to those from healthy donors as they co - expressed higher levels of cd ##38 and h ##la - dr , indicating their recent in vivo activation . our study is the first to directly measure sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - reactive t cell responses providing critical tools for large scale testing , in depth ep ##ito ##pe mapping and characterization of potential cross - reactive cellular immunity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the presence of pre - existing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - reactive t cells in healthy donors is of high interest but larger scale prospective co ##hort studies are needed to assess whether their presence is a co ##rre ##late
background the current pan ##de ##mic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused a great loss in lives and economy . detecting viral rna ##s on nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and throat sw ##ab ##s is the standard approach for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnosis with variable success . currently , there are only a few studies describing the ser ##ological diagnostic methods that involve the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - specific i ##gm and i ##gg . here , we aimed to develop a more quantitative and sensitive ser ##ological test for co ##vid - 19 diagnosis , monitoring and clinical investigation , based on the detection of antigen - specific i ##ga as well as i ##gm and i ##gg in blood in response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods in this investigation , we report the development of a set of valid ##ated diagnostic kits for detecting serum i ##ga , i ##gm , and i ##gg specific to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) and receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike protein by che ##mi - lu ##mine ##sc ##ence im ##mun ##o - analysis . the kits were tested with a co ##hort of 216 sera from 87 laboratory - confirmed co ##vid - 19 patients , and 48 ##3 sera from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 negative or healthy individuals as negative controls . a standard receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy . using the kits , serum levels of i ##ga , i ##gm , and i ##gg were analyzed , in response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and co ##vid - 19 pathogen ##esis . findings the diagnostic kits based on the rb ##d antigen out ##per ##formed those based on the np . rb ##d - specific i ##ga , i ##gm , and i ##gg detection kits showed sen ##sit ##iv ##ities of 98 . 6 % , 96 . 8 % , and 96 . 8 % , and specific ##ities of 98 . 1 % , 92 . 3 % , and 99 . 8 % , respectively . in addition , using pu ##rified rb ##d - specific im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins from a serum pool of co ##vid - 19 patients as standards , the serum concentrations of rb ##d - specific i ##ga , i ##gm , and i ##gg proteins were determined . the concentrations varied widely among different patients . median concentration of i ##ga and i ##gm reached peaks at 16 - 20 days after illness onset at 8 . 84 μ ##g / ml and 7 . 25 μ ##g / ml , respectively , while median concentration of i ##gg peaked during
testing for active sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is a fundamental tool in public health measures taken to control the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . due to the overwhelming use of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r tests worldwide , availability of test kits has become a major bottle ##neck . here we demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of two simple pool ##ing strategies that can increase testing capacity about 5 - fold to 7 . 5 - fold , in populations with a low infection rate . we have implemented the method in a routine clinical diagnosis setting , and already tested 2 , 168 individuals for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using 311 rna extraction and rt - pc ##r kits .  
on january 26 2020 , the first corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) case was reported in arizona of an individual with travel history ( 3rd case in the us ) . here , we report on early sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sentinel surveillance in te ##mp ##e , arizona . gen ##omic characterization identified an isolate encoding a 27 amino acid in - frame del ##eti ##on in accessory protein or ##f ##7 ##a , the or ##th ##olo ##g of sar ##s - co ##v immune antagonist or ##f ##7 ##a / x ##4 .  
to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the limited availability of rna extraction re ##age ##nts , we developed a protocol for direct rt - q ##pc ##r to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . inc ##uba ##tion of specimens at 65 ##oc for 10 minutes along with the use of ta ##q ##path ##™ 1 - step rt - q ##pc ##r master mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna than many other commercial and laboratory - developed methods . in 132 specimens submitted for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing , the sensitivity , specific ##ity and accuracy of our opt ##imi ##zed approach were 95 % , 99 % and 98 . 5 % , respectively , with reference to results obtained by a standard approach involving rna extraction . also , the rt - q ##pc ##r ct values obtained by the two methods were highly correlated .  
background : the o ##ise department in france has been heavily affected by co ##vid - 19 in early 2020 . methods : between 30 march and 4 april 2020 , we conducted a retrospective closed co ##hort study among pupils , their parents and siblings , as well as teachers and non - teaching staff of a high - school located in o ##ise . participants completed a question ##naire that covered history of fever and / or respiratory symptoms since 13 january 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies . the infection attack rate ( ia ##r ) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection based on antibody detection . blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 march 2020 in the o ##ise department were also tested for presence of anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies . findings : of the 66 ##1 participants ( median age : 37 years ) , 171 participants had anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies . the overall ia ##r was 25 . 9 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) = 22 . 6 - 29 . 4 ) , and the infection fatal ##ity rate was 0 % ( one - sided 97 . 5 % ci = 0 - 2 . 1 ) . nine of the ten participants hospital ##ised since mid - january were in the infected group , giving a hospital ##isation rate of 5 . 3 % ( 95 % ci = 2 . 4 - 9 . 8 ) . an ##os ##mia and age ##usia had high positive predict ##ive values for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ( 84 . 7 % and 88 . 1 % , respectively ) . smoke ##rs had a lower ia ##r compared to non - smoke ##rs ( 7 . 2 % versus 28 . 0 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . the proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17 . 0 % ( 95 % ci = 11 . 2 - 23 . 4 ) . the proportion of donors with anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the o ##ise department was 3 . 0 % ( 95 % ci = 1 . 1 - 6 . 4 ) . interpretation : the relatively low ia ##r observed in an area where sar ##s - co ##v - 2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time , and that lifting these measures in france will be long and complex .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has caused an unprecedented global public health and economy crisis . the origin and emergence of its causal agent , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in the human population remains mysterious , although bat and pang ##olin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs . striking ##ly , comparing to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - like co ##vs identified in bats and pang ##olin ##s , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 harbor ##s a poly ##bas ##ic fur ##in cleavage site in its spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 uses human ace ##2 as its receptor to in ##fect cells . receptor recognition by the s protein is the major deter ##mina ##nt of host range , tissue tr ##op ##ism , and pathogen ##esis of corona ##virus ##es . in an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amp ##li ##fying animal hosts of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we examined receptor activity of ace ##2 from 14 mammal species and found that ace ##2 from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles pseudo ##type ##d with the wild - type or fur ##in cleavage site def ##icient s protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . ace ##2 of human / r ##hes ##us monkey and rat / mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity , respectively . among the remaining species , ace ##2 from rabbit and pang ##olin strongly bound to the s ##1 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein and efficiently supported the pseudo ##type ##d virus infection . these findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs , zoo ##not ##ic transmission , human - to - animal transmission , and use of animal models .  
abstract ##the ability to detect the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in a widespread epidemic is crucial for screening of carriers and for the success of qu ##aran ##tine efforts . methods based on real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) and sequencing are being used for virus detection and characterization . however , rna viruses are known for their high genetic diversity which poses a challenge for the design of efficient nuclei ##c acid - based ass ##ays . the first sar ##s - co ##v - 2 gen ##omic sequences already showed novel mutations , which may affect the efficiency of available screening tests leading to false - negative diagnosis or in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt therapeutic ##s . here we describe the co ##v ##2 ##id ( http : / / co ##vid . port ##uge ##ne . com / ) , a free database built to facilitate the evaluation of molecular methods for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and treatment of co ##vid - 19 . the database evaluate ##s the available ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide sequences ( pc ##r prime ##rs , rt - q ##pc ##r probe ##s , etc . ) considering the genetic diversity of the virus . updated sequences alignment ##s are used to constantly verify the theoretical efficiency of available testing methods . detailed information on available detection protocols are also available to help laboratories implementing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing .  
the infection of the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have caused more than 150 , 000 deaths , but no vaccine or specific therapeutic antibody is currently available . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 relies on its spike protein , in particular the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) , to bind human cell receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) for viral entry , and thus targeting rb ##d holds the promise for preventing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . in this work , a competitive bio ##pan ##ning strategy of a ph ##age display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against rb ##d . high - affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard pan ##ning process in which rb ##d - his rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein was im ##mo ##bil ##ized as a bait . at the next two rounds , im ##mo ##bil ##ized ace ##2 - fc and free rb ##d - his proteins were mixed with the enriched ph ##age antibodies . antibodies binding to rb ##d at ep ##ito ##pes different from ace ##2 - binding site were captured by the im ##mo ##bil ##ized ace ##2 - fc , forming a sandwich complex . only antibodies competed with ace ##2 for recognizing rb ##d at the same or similar ep ##ito ##pes can bind to the free rb ##d - his in the super ##nat ##ant and be subsequently separated by the ni - nt ##a magnetic beads . top 1 lead from the competitive bio ##pan ##ning of a synthetic antibody library , li ##b ab ##1 , was produced as the full - length i ##gg ##1 format . it was proved to competitive ##ly block the binding of rb ##d to ace ##2 protein , and potent ##ly inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pseudo ##virus infection of ace ##2 - over ##ex ##pressing he ##la cells with ic ##50 values of 12 ##n ##m . nevertheless , top 1 lead from the standard bio ##pan ##ning of li ##b ab ##1 , can only bind to rb ##d in vitro but not have the blocking or neutral ##ization activity . our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of rb ##d , and it would speed up the discovery of neutral ##izing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the emerge ##nt global pan ##de ##mic caused by the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has led to increased mortality and negatively impacted day to day activities of human ##kind within a short period of time . as the data is rapidly emerging from earlier outbreak locations around the world , there are efforts to ass ##imi ##late this with the knowledge from prior epidemic ##s and find rapid solutions for this . one of the observations and a recurring theme is the di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate differences in the incidence of infection and the con ##se ##quent mortality between males and females . we , therefore , analyzed retrospective data ##set ##s from the previous epidemic ##s and the ongoing pan ##de ##mic in order to address these differences in clinical outcomes . the data shows that even though the infection rates are similar , the odds ratio of male mortality remains high , indicating a diver ##gence in the cross ##talk between the three pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ( hc ##ov ##s ) - the sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and immune effect ##ors in the two sexes . one pro ##xi ##mate cause is the sex - specific modulation of the x - linked genes that can influence su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection . future studies are needed to confirm these findings , which can form the basis for developing rational strategies for ending the current and preventing future pan ##de ##mics .  
background : several sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline . this study aims to inform sar ##s - co ##v - 2 vaccine development , li ##cens ##ure , decision - making , and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population - level impact . methods : va ##cci ##nation impact was assessed at various e ##ffi ##ca ##cies using an age - structured mathematical model describing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission and disease progression , with application for china . results : a prop ##hyl ##actic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition ( ve ##s ) of ≥ ##70 % is needed to eliminate this infection . a vaccine with ve ##s < 70 % will still have a major impact , and may control the infection if it reduces infectious ##ness or infection duration among those va ##cci ##nated who acquire the infection , or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social - di ##stan ##cing intervention ( < 20 % reduction in contact rate ) , or complement ##ed with herd immunity . va ##cci ##nation is cost - effective . for a vaccine with ve ##s of 50 % , number of va ##cci ##nation ##s needed to ave ##rt one infection is only 2 . 4 , one severe disease case is 25 . 5 , one critical disease case is 33 . 2 , and one death is 65 . 1 . gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prior ##iti ##zing those ≥ ##60 years . probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with ve ##s ≥ ##70 % , regardless of number of virus introductions . yet , an increase in social contact rate among those va ##cci ##nated ( behavior compensation ) can undermine vaccine impact . conclusions : even a partially - e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and at high cost - effectiveness . in addition to the primary end ##point on infection acquisition , developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and / or proxy bio ##mark ##ers , since such secondary end ##points may prove critical in li ##cens ##ure , decision - making , and vaccine impact .  
the emergence of the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has led to a pan ##de ##mic in ##fect ##ing more than two million people worldwide in less than four months , posing a major threat to healthcare systems . this is compound ##ed by the shortage of available tests causing numerous healthcare workers to un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly self - isolate . we provide a road ##ma ##p ins ##tructing how a research institute can be rep ##ur ##posed in the midst of this crisis , in collaboration with partner hospitals and an established diagnostic laboratory , harness ##ing existing expertise in virus handling , robotics , pc ##r , and data science to derive a rapid , high through ##put diagnostic testing pipeline for detecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in patients with suspected co ##vid - 19 . the pipeline is used to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from combined nose - throat sw ##ab ##s and end ##ot ##rac ##hea ##l secret ##ions / bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid . notably , it relies on a series of in - house buffer ##s for virus ina ##ct ##ivation and the extraction of viral rna , thereby reducing the dependency on commercial suppliers at times of global shortage . we use a commercial rt - pc ##r ass ##ay , from b ##gi , and results are reported with a be ##sp ##oke online web application that integrate ##s with the healthcare digital system . this strategy facilitates the remote reporting of thousands of samples a day with a turn ##around time of under 24 hours , universally applicable to laboratories worldwide .  
the pan ##de ##mic from the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) led to > 170 , 000 deaths , including > 14 , 500 in new york city ( nyc ) alone . this pan ##de ##mic highlighted a pressing clinical and public health need for rapid , scala ##ble diagnostic ##s that can detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , inter ##rogate strain evolution , and map host response in patients . to address these challenges , we designed a fast ( 30 minute ) color ##ime ##tric test to identify sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and simultaneously developed a large - scale shotgun meta ##tra ##ns ##cript ##omic prof ##iling platform for nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . both technologies were used to profile 338 clinical specimens tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and 86 nyc subway samples , creating a broad molecular picture of the co ##vid - 19 epidemic in nyc . our results nominate a novel , nyc - enriched sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sub ##cl ##ade , reveal specific host responses in ace pathways , and find medication risks associated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and ace inhibitors . our findings have immediate applications to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnostic ##s , public health monitoring , and therapeutic development .  
the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) at the end of 2019 from the chinese province of hub ##ei and its subsequent pan ##de ##mic spread highlight the importance of understanding the full molecular details of corona ##virus infection and pathogen ##esis . here , we compared a variety of replication features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v and anal ##yse ##d the cy ##top ##ath ##ology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used ve ##ro e ##6 cell line . compared to sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 generated higher levels of intra ##cellular viral rna , but striking ##ly about 50 - fold less infectious viral pro ##geny was recovered from the culture medium . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence microscopy of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected cells established extensive cross - react ##ivity of anti ##ser ##a previously raised against a variety of non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins , membrane and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v . electron microscopy revealed that the ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural changes induced by the two sar ##s viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection . furthermore , we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of corona ##virus replication ( re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , ali ##sp ##ori ##vir and ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ) is very similar , but that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre - treatment of cells with peg ##yla ##ted inter ##fer ##on alpha . an important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon pass ##aging in ve ##ro e ##6 cells - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene . these mutations change or del ##ete a put ##ative fur ##in - like cleavage site in the region connecting the s ##1 and s ##2 domains and result in a very prominent ph ##eno ##typic change in plaque ass ##ays .  
objectives : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 whole - genome analysis has identified three large clade ##s spreading worldwide , designated g , v and s . this study aims to analyze the diffusion of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in spain / europe . methods : maximum likelihood phylogenetic and bay ##esian ph ##yl ##od ##yna ##mic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . results : phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in spain revealed that most of them are distributed in g and s clade ##s ( 13 sequences in each ) with the remaining two sequences branching in the v clade . eleven of the spanish viruses of the s clade and six of the g clade grouped in two different mono ##phy ##let ##ic clusters ( s - spain and g - spain , respectively ) , with the s - spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from europe and the americas . the most recent common ancestor ( mr ##ca ) of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic was estimated in the city of wu ##han , china , around november 24 , 2019 , with a 95 % highest posterior density ( hp ##d ) interval from october 30 - december 17 , 2019 . the origin of s - spain and g - spain clusters were estimated in spain around february 14 and 18 , 2020 , respectively , with a possible ancestry of s - spain in shanghai . conclusions : multiple sar ##s - co ##v - 2 introductions have been detected in spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters , with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries . these results highlight the extraordinary potential of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination .  
we di ##sse ##ct the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in human lung hosts from the initial phase of receptor binding to viral replication machinery using a systems biological approach . two independent lung protein interact ##ome were contracted to rev ##el the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hi ##jack ##ing machinery in the pathogen ##esis virus . most of the functional hub ##s interact ##ome proteins were associated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . also , 52 % of the proteins related to cardiovascular disease , and they involved in viral infection , which causes vulnerability and severity in the risk individuals . we also showed five inter ##con ##ne ##cting cascade ##s between hub ##s of both networks that explore the preparation of the optimal environment in the host for viral replication initiated at the phase of receptor attachment . interesting ##ly , we propose that seven potential mir ##nas targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 enters cells using its spike protein , which is also the main target of neutral ##izing antibodies . therefore , ass ##ays to measure how antibodies and sera affect spike - mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity . because sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty - level - 3 virus , one way to sim ##plify such ass ##ays is to pseudo ##type bio ##sa ##fe ##ty - level - 2 viral particles with spike . such pseudo ##ty ##ping has now been described for single - cycle lent ##iv ##ira ##l , retro ##vira ##l and vs ##v particles , but the re ##age ##nts and protocols are not widely available . here we detail how to effectively pseudo ##type lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike and in ##fect 293 ##t cells engineered to express the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor , ace ##2 . we also make all the key experimental re ##age ##nts available in the bei resources repository of at ##cc and the ni ##h . furthermore , we demonstrate how these pseudo ##type ##d lent ##iv ##ira ##l particles can be used to measure the neutral ##izing activity of human sera or plasma against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in convenient lucifer ##ase - based ass ##ays , thereby providing a valuable complement to elisa - based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutral ##ization .  
a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , also called novel corona ##virus 2019 ( nc ##ov - 19 ) , started to ci ##rc ##ulate among humans around december 2019 , and it is now widespread as a global pan ##de ##mic . the disease caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus is called co ##vid - 19 , which is highly con ##tag ##ious and has an overall mortality rate of 6 . 4 % as of april 15 , 2020 . there is no vaccine or anti ##vira ##l available for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in this study , we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) . using the fr ##et - based en ##zy ##matic ass ##ay , several inhibitors including bo ##ce ##pre ##vir , g ##c - 37 ##6 , cal ##pa ##in inhibitors ii , xii , and mg - 132 were identified to have potent activity with single - digit to sub ##mic ##rom ##olar ic ##50 values in the en ##zy ##matic ass ##ay . the mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies and thermal shift binding ass ##ays . significantly , four compounds ( bo ##ce ##pre ##vir , g ##c - 37 ##6 , cal ##pa ##in inhibitors ii and xii ) inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral replication in cell culture with ec ##50 values ranging from 0 . 49 to 3 . 37 micro ##mo ##lar . notably , bo ##ce ##pre ##vir , cal ##pa ##in inhibitors ii and xii represent novel che ##mot ##ype ##s that are distinct from known mp ##ro inhibitors . overall , the compounds identified here ##in provide promising starting points for the further development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 therapeutic ##s .  
pan ##de ##mics originating from pathogen transmission between animals and humans highlight the broader need to understand how natural hosts have evolved in response to emerging human pathogen ##s and which groups may be susceptible to infection . here , we investigate ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the host protein bound by sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we find that the ace ##2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats , the group in which the pro ##gen ##itors of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized to have evolved , particularly in residues that contact sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we detect positive selection in non - bat mammals in ace ##2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats , without enrichment of selection in residues that contact sar ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . additionally , we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact sar ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spill ##over events . this work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals , particularly bats , and corona ##virus ##es , and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains .  
human severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is most closely related , by average genetic distance , to two corona ##virus ##es isolated from bats , rat ##g ##13 and rm ##yn ##0 ##2 . however , there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and a pang ##olin isolated strain , g ##d ##41 ##0 ##7 ##21 , in the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike protein , a pattern that can be caused by either rec ##om ##bina ##tion or by converge ##nt amino acid evolution driven by natural selection . we perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous diver ##gence , which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid diver ##gence , between human sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and related strains . we show that the synonymous diver ##gence between the bat derived viruses and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is larger than between g ##d ##41 ##0 ##7 ##21 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the rb ##d , providing strong additional support for the rec ##om ##bina ##tion hypothesis . however , the synonymous diver ##gence between pang ##olin strain and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is also relatively high , which is not consistent with a recent rec ##om ##bina ##tion between them , instead it suggests a rec ##om ##bina ##tion into rat ##g ##13 . we also find a 14 - fold increase in the d ##n / ds ratio from the lineage leading to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to the strains of the current pan ##de ##mic , suggesting that the vast majority of non - synonymous mutations currently se ##gre ##gating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness . finally , we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and rat ##g ##13 or rm ##yn ##0 ##2 based on synonymous diver ##gence , is 51 . 71 years ( 95 % c . i . , 28 . 11 - 75 . 31 ) and 37 . 02 years ( 95 % c . i . , 18 . 19 - 55 . 85 ) , respectively .  
the current co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , caused by a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , poses serious threats to public health and social stability , calling for urgent need for vaccines and therapeutic ##s . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is genetically close to sar ##s - co ##v , thus it is important to define the between antigen ##ic cross - react ##ivity and neutral ##ization . in this study , we firstly analyzed 20 con ##vale ##scent serum samples collected from sar ##s - co ##v infected individuals during the 2003 sar ##s outbreak . all patient sera reacted strongly with the s ##1 subunit and receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v , cross - reacted with the s ec ##to ##dom ##ain , s ##1 , rb ##d , and s ##2 proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and neutral ##ized both sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein - driven infections . multiple panels of anti ##ser ##a from mice and rabbits im ##mun ##ized with a full - length s and rb ##d im ##mun ##ogen ##s of sar ##s - co ##v were also characterized , verify ##ing the cross - reactive neutral ##ization against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . interesting ##ly , we found that a palm ci ##vet sar ##s - co ##v - derived rb ##d eli ##cite ##d more potent cross - neutral ##izing responses in im ##mun ##ized animals than the rb ##d from a human sar ##s - co ##v strain , informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging co ##vs .  
currently , the global co ##vid - 19 ( corona ##virus disease - 2019 ) pan ##de ##mic is affecting the health and / or socio ##economic life of almost each people in the world . finding vaccines and therapeutic ##s is urgent but without forgetting to el ##uc ##ida ##te the molecular mechanisms that allow some viruses to become dangerous for humans . here , analysis of all proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 revealed a unique pp ##xy late ( l ) domain motif 25 - pp ##ay - 28 in n - terminal of spike protein . it was demonstrated in enveloped rna viruses that pp ##xy motif recruits ned ##d ##4 e ##3 u ##bi ##qui ##tin liga ##ses and ultimately the es ##cr ##t complex to enhance virus bud ##ding and release that means a high viral load , thus facilitating new infections . note that pp ##xy motif is not present in proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . this suggests that pp ##xy motif by its role in enhancing the viral load could explain why sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is more con ##tag ##ious than sar ##s - co ##v . of course , after the experimental verification ##s showing that pp ##xy motif plays the same role as reported for other enveloped rna viruses , it could become an interesting target for the development of novel host - oriented anti ##vira ##ls therapeutic ##s for preventing s protein to recruit ned ##d ##4 e ##3 liga ##ses partners .  
co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has caused tens of thousands of deaths and is now a severe threat to global health . clinical practice has demonstrated that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ##1 specific antibodies and viral antigen ##s can be used as diagnostic and pro ##gno ##stic markers of co ##vid - 19 . however , the popular point - of - care bio ##mark ##er detection technologies , such as the lateral - flow test strips , provide only yes / no information and have very limited sen ##sit ##iv ##ities . thus , it has a high false - negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of the patient ' s immune response . conventional elisa ( enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ) , on the other hand , can provide quantitative , accurate , and sensitive results , but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long ass ##ay time . in addition , samples need to be sent to centralized labs , which significantly increases the turn - around time . here , we present a micro ##fl ##uid ##ic elisa technology for rapid ( 15 - 20 minutes ) , quantitative , sensitive detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 bio ##mark ##ers using sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific i ##gg and viral antigen - s protein in serum . we also characterized various human ##ized mono ##cl ##onal i ##gg , and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ##1 protein that can serve as the cal ##ib ##ration standard of anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ##1 i ##gg in ser ##ological analyses . furthermore , we demonstrated that our micro ##fl ##uid ##ic elisa platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of mono ##cl ##onal anti - s ##1 antibodies . the micro ##fl ##uid ##ic elisa device is highly portable and requires less than 10 μ ##l of samples for each channel . therefore , our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of co ##vid - 19 patients and vaccine recipients at point - of - care .  
abstract ##the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the acute respiratory disease co ##vid - 19 which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread . meanwhile , increased demand in testing has led to shortage of re ##age ##nts , supplies , and compromised the performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries . both the world health organization ( who ) and the center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) recommend multi - step rt - pc ##r ass ##ays using multiple prime ##r and probe pairs , which might com ##pl ##icate interpretation of the test results especially for border ##line cases . in this study , we describe an alternative rt - pc ##r approach for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna that can be used for the probe - based detection of clinical isolate ##s in the diagnostic ##s as well as in research labs using a low cost sy ##br green method . for the evaluation , we used samples from patients with confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and performed rt - pc ##r ass ##ays along with successive dil ##ution ##s of rna standards to determine the limit of detection . we identified an m - gene binding prime ##r and probe pair highly suitable for quantitative detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna for diagnostic and research purposes .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , has caused an outburst of pneumonia cases in wu ##han , china . we report the production of specific i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies after the infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and its implication for the diagnosis , pathology and the course of the disease as well as the rec ##ur ##rence of positive nuclei ##c acid tests after discharge . methods : test results for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies of 221 confirmed co ##vid - 19 patients were retrospective ##ly examined , and their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on various subgroup ##s . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies were determined with the che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence method . findings : the concentration ( s / co ) of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies peaked on day 19 - 21 after sy ##mpt ##om onset , with a median of 17 . 38 ( iq ##r 4 . 39 - 36 . 4 ) for i ##gm and 5 . 59 ( iq ##r 0 . 73 - 13 . 65 ) for i ##gg . detection rates reached highest on day 16 - 18 and day 19 - 21 for i ##gm and i ##gg , which were 73 . 6 % and 98 . 6 % , respectively , with significantly higher concentration of i ##gg in critically ill patients than in those with mild to moderate disease ( p = 0 . 02 ##7 ) . the concentration of the antibodies on day 16 - 21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease ( spear ##man r < 0 . 20 , p > 0 . 05 ) . nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s revealed positive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna in up to 52 . 7 % of recovered patients after discharge , whose i ##gg proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative rna results ( p = 0 . 00 ##9 ) . i ##gg and i ##gm were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7 - day interval , and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21 . 2 % ( iq ##r , 11 . 2 % ， 34 . 48 % ) for i ##gg and 23 . 05 % ( iq ##r , - 27 . 96 % ， 46 . 13 % ) for i ##gm , without statistical significance between the patients with re - detect ##able positive rna results and those with negative rna results after discharge . however , those with positive results experienced a count decrease in l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte subset
background : the novel corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , spreads rapidly across the world . the exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in over ##crow ##ding of emergency departments ( ed ) . detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is based on an rt - pc ##r of nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab material . however , rt - pc ##r testing is time - consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials . therefore , we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual ′ s risk of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection at the ed . methods : in this multi ##cent ##er retrospective study , routine laboratory parameters ( c - reactive protein , lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase , fe ##rri ##tin , absolute ne ##ut ##rop ##hil and l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts ) , demographic data and the chest x - ray / ct result from 96 ##7 patients entering the ed with respiratory symptoms were gathered . using these parameters , an easy - to - use point - based algorithm , called the corona - score , was developed to disc ##rim ##inate between patients that tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by rt - pc ##r and those testing negative . computational sampling was used to opt ##imi ##ze the corona - score . validation of the model was performed using data from 59 ##2 patients . results : the corona - score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0 . 91 in the validation population . patients testing negative for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 showed a median corona - score of 3 versus 11 ( scale 0 - 14 ) in patients testing positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( p < 0 . 001 ) . using cut - off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specific ##ity of 96 % and 95 % , respectively . conclusion : the corona - score effectively predict ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r outcome based on routine parameters . this algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection status of patients presenting at the ed with respiratory symptoms .  
background : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the cause of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , is associated with respiratory - related mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . ass ##ays to detect virus - specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response . methodology : quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies by lucifer ##ase im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay systems ( lips ) to the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike proteins were analyzed in 100 cross - sectional or longitudinal samples from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - infected patients . a subset of samples was tested with and without heat ina ##ct ##ivation . results : fifteen or more days after sy ##mpt ##om onset , antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein showed 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specific ##ity , while antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91 % sensitivity and 100 % specific ##ity . neither antibody levels nor the rate of ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity were significantly reduced by heat ina ##ct ##ivation of samples . analysis of daily samples from six patients with co ##vid - 19 showed anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike antibodies appearing between day 8 to day 14 after initial symptoms . im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 compared to im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##ete ##nt patients . conclusions : antibody to the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection . analyzing heat - inactivated samples by lips is a safe and sensitive method for detecting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies .  
importance : healthcare workers are presumed to be at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection due to occupational exposure to infected patients . however , no ep ##ide ##mi ##ological study has examined the prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in a co ##hort of healthcare workers during the early phase of community transmission . objective : to determine the baseline prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in a co ##hort of previously und ##ia ##gno ##sed healthcare workers and a comparison group of non - healthcare workers . design : prospective co ##hort study setting : a large u . s . university and two affiliated university hospitals participants : 54 ##6 health care workers and 283 non - health care workers with no known prior sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection exposure : healthcare worker status and role main outcome ( s ) and measure ( s ) : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection status as determined by presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna in oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . results : at baseline , 41 ( 5 . 0 % ) of participants tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , of whom 14 ( 34 . 2 % ) reported symptoms . the prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection was higher among healthcare workers ( 7 . 3 % ) than in non - healthcare workers ( 0 . 4 % ) , representing a 7 . 0 % greater absolute risk ( 95 % confidence interval for risk difference 4 . 7 % , 9 . 3 % ) . the majority of infected healthcare workers ( 62 . 5 % ) worked as nurses . positive tests increased across the two weeks of co ##hort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties . conclusions and relevance : in a prospective co ##hort conducted in the early phases of community transmission , healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection than non - healthcare workers , at ##test ##ing to the occupational hazards of caring for patients in this crisis . baseline data reported here will enable us to monitor the spread of infection and examine risk factors for transmission among healthcare workers . these results will inform optimal strategies for protecting the healthcare workforce , their families , and their patients .  
huang et al . ( 2019 ) used their ep ##ira ##nk algorithm , which emphasizes forward - and - backward commuter flow between homes and workplace ##s , to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in taiwan : the 2009 - h ##1 ##n ##1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000 - 2008 type 71 enter ##ov ##irus ( ev ) . as this article was being prepared , the spreading mechanism of the novel corona ##virus disease now designated as co ##vid - 19 had yet to be identified , but according to the american centers for disease control , its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other corona ##virus ##es such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v - 1 ) or middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . to consider potential co ##vid - 19 spatial patterns , we applied ep ##ira ##nk to the 2003 sar ##s outbreak in north taiwan for comparison with h ##1 ##n ##1 and ev . sar ##s was found to be less con ##tag ##ious than h ##1 ##n ##1 or ev , but with a significantly higher fatal ##ity rate . the characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns , as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward com ##mut ##ing movement . our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate ep ##ira ##nk spatial patterns for the 2003 sar ##s outbreak for comparison with ep ##ira ##nk - determined distributions for the h ##1 ##n ##1 and ev outbreak ##s . our results indicate that the daytime parameter ( i . e . , forward movement effect ) range was slightly higher ( 0 . 5 - 0 . 55 ) for the sar ##s outbreak than for either the influenza ( 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 ) or ev ( 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 ) outbreak ##s , suggesting that the forward - and - backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of sar ##s . while co ##vid - 19 might resemble either sar ##s or h ##1 ##n ##1 in terms of spatial spreading , its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in - between , with backward movement being dominant ( similar to h ##1 ##n ##1 ) or with forward and backward movement being equally important ( similar to sar ##s ) . building on huang et al . ( 2019 ) paper , we present an estimated risk distribution pattern for the taipei metropolitan area for a daytime parameter of 0 . 55 .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rapidly spread around the world during 2020 , but the precise time in which the virus began to spread locally is currently unknown for most countries . here , we estimate the probable onset date of the community spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from the cumulative number of deaths reported during the early stage of the epidemic in western europe and the americas . our results support that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 probably started to spread locally in all western countries analyzed between the middle of january and early february 2020 , thus long before community transmission was officially recognized and control measures were implemented .  
background : to clarify the characteristic and the duration of positive nuclei ##c acid in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , including as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic children . methods : a total of 32 children confirmed with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection between january 24 and february 12 , 2020 from four provinces in western china were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and qu ##aran ##tine 14 days later . results : eleven children ( 34 % ) were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , among whom six children had normal computed tom ##ographic ( ct ) scan images . age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of ct scan in children infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the concentrations of white blood cells and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s were higher in children with as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or ct abnormalities . patients who presented with ct abnormalities had lower d - dime ##r or lower total bi ##li ##ru ##bin than those who had normal ct scan but clinical symptoms . all children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ( pic ##u ) . the mean duration of positive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid was 15 . 4 ( sd = 7 . 2 ) days and similar for both as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic children and children with symptoms or ct abnormalities . we found a significant negative correlation between the l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte count and the duration of positive nuclei ##c acid test . conclusions : children with as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection should be qu ##aran ##tine ##d for the same duration as sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the clinical significance and mechanism behind the negative correlation between the number of l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and the duration of positive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 needs further study .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the cause of human corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , emerged in wu ##han , china in december 2019 . the virus rapidly spread globally , resulting in a public - health crisis including more than one million cases and tens of thousands of deaths . here , we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available re ##age ##nts and ass ##ays for the molecular detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in infected formal ##in fixed para ##ffin embedded ( ff ##pe ) cell pe ##llet ##s . we identified a suitable rabbit poly ##cl ##onal anti - sar ##s - co ##v spike protein antibody and a mouse mono ##cl ##onal anti - sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) antibody for cross detection of the respective sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry ( i ##hc ) and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) . next , we established rna ##scope in situ hybrid ##ization ( is ##h ) to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . furthermore , we established a multiple ##x flu ##orescence is ##h ( m ##fish ) to detect positive - sense sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna and negative - sense sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna ( a replica ##tive intermediate indicating viral replication ) . finally , we developed a dual stain ##ing ass ##ay using i ##hc and is ##h to detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antigen and rna in the same ff ##pe section . these re ##age ##nts and ass ##ays will accelerate co ##vid - 19 pathogen ##esis studies in humans and in co ##vid - 19 animal models .  
abstracts ##ars - co ##v - 2 is a novel corona ##virus that has rapidly spread across the globe . in the netherlands , the first case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been notified on the 27th of february . here , we describe the first three weeks of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak in the netherlands , which started with several different introductory events from italy , austria , germany and france followed by local amp ##li ##fication in , and later also , outside the south of the netherlands . the timely generation of whole genome sequences combined with ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations facilitated early decision making in an attempt to control local transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the netherlands .  
corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a viral pan ##de ##mic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . co ##vid - 19 is predominantly defined by respiratory symptoms , but cardiac complications including ar ##rh ##yt ##hmi ##as , heart failure , and viral my ##oca ##rdi ##tis are also prevalent . although the systemic is ##che ##mic and inflammatory responses caused by co ##vid - 19 can detrimental ##ly affect cardiac function , the direct impact of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection on human card ##iom ##yo ##cytes is not well - understood . we used human induced pl ##uri ##pot ##ent stem cell - derived card ##iom ##yo ##cytes ( hips ##c - cm ##s ) as a model system to examine the mechanisms of card ##iom ##yo ##cy ##te - specific infection by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . microscopy and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can enter and replicate within hips ##c - cm ##s , local ##izing at per ##in ##uc ##lea ##r locations within the cy ##top ##las ##m . viral cy ##top ##athic effect induced hips ##c - cm ap ##op ##tosis and ce ##ssa ##tion of beating after 72 hours of infection . these studies show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can in ##fect hips ##c - cm ##s in vitro , establishing a model for el ##uc ##ida ##ting the mechanisms of infection and potentially a cardiac - specific anti ##vira ##l drug screening platform .  
the global population is at present suffering from a pan ##de ##mic of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by the novel corona ##virus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence ( ai ) to predict blue ##print ##s for designing universal vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of t - cell ep ##ito ##pes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population . to help achieve these aims , we profile ##d the entire sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome across the most frequent 100 h ##la - a , h ##la - b and h ##la - dr all ##eles in the human population , using host - infected cell surface antigen presentation and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity predict ##ors from the nec immune profile ##r suite of tools , and generated comprehensive ep ##ito ##pe maps . we then used these ep ##ito ##pe maps as input for a monte carlo simulation designed to identify statistical ##ly significant ep ##ito ##pe hot ##sp ##ot regions in the virus that are most likely to be im ##mun ##ogenic across a broad spectrum of h ##la types . we then removed ep ##ito ##pe hot ##sp ##ots that shared significant homo ##logy with proteins in the human pro ##te ##ome to reduce the chance of inducing off - target auto ##im ##mun ##e responses . we also analyzed the antigen presentation and im ##mun ##ogenic landscape of all the non ##sy ##non ##ym ##ous mutations across 340 ##0 different sequences of the virus , to identify a trend whereby sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host - infected cells , and consequently detected by the host immune system . a sequence conservation analysis then removed ep ##ito ##pe hot ##sp ##ots that occurred in less - conserved regions of the viral pro ##te ##ome . finally , we used a database of the h ##la gen ##otype ##s of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a digital twin type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hot ##sp ##ots would work in a diverse human population , and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of ep ##ito ##pes hot ##sp ##ots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population . by combining the antigen presentation to the infected - host cell surface and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity predictions of the nec immune profile ##r with a robust monte carlo and digital twin simulation , we have managed to profile the entire sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##te ##ome and identify a subset of ep ##ito ##pe hot ##sp ##ots that could be harness ##ed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population . 
entry of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , et ##iol ##ogical agent of co ##vid - 19 , in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ace ##2 receptor and a ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 . although complex between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein and ace ##2 has been structurally resolved , the molecular details of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 complex are still elusive . t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 is responsible for pri ##ming of the viral spike protein that en ##tails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites , ar ##g ##6 ##85 / ser ##6 ##86 and ar ##g ##8 ##15 / ser ##8 ##16 . the present study aims to investigate the conform ##ation ##al details of complex between t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein , in order to disc ##ern the finer details of the pri ##ming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets . briefly , full length structural model of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites . the docking simulations showed that t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 interact ##s with the two different loops of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein , each containing different cleavage sites . key functional residues of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ( his ##29 ##6 , ser ##44 ##1 and ser ##46 ##0 ) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein . compared to the n - terminal cleavage site ( ar ##g ##6 ##85 / ser ##6 ##86 ) , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 region that interact with c - terminal cleavage site ( ar ##g ##8 ##15 / ser ##8 ##16 ) of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more drug ##ga ##ble . in summary , the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing .  
the outbreak of the 2019 - nc ##ov corona ##virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome which can be fatal , especially in elderly population , has been declared a pan ##de ##mic ##by the world health organization . many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and anti ##vira ##l drugs for treatment of this viral disease . the viral co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is one of the main targets for ph ##arm ##aco ##logical intervention . its receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) interact ##s with the human ace ##2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genome ##s into the host cell . in this work , we report on ##the differences in the binding of the rb ##d of the previous corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v and of the newer 2019 - nc ##ov corona ##virus to the human ace ##2 receptor using atom ##istic molecular dynamics techniques . our results show major mutations in the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d with respect to the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d occurring at the interface of rb ##d - ace ##2 complex . these mutations make the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d protein backbone much more flexible , hydro ##phobic interactions are reduced and additional polar / charged residues appear at the interface . we observe that higher flexibility of the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d with respect to the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d and ace ##2 and to about 20 % more contacts between them in comparison with sar ##s - co ##v . taken together , the 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ace ##2 receptor . the mutations not only stabilize the binding interface , they also lead to overall more stable 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d protein structure , even far from the binding interface . our results on the molecular differences in the binding between the two viruses can provide important inputs for development of appropriate anti ##vira ##l treatments of the new viruses , addressing the necessity of ongoing pan ##de ##mics .  
virus entry is a multi ##ste ##p process . it initiate ##s when the virus attache ##s to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cy ##tos ##ol . genetically unrelated viruses can sub ##vert analogous sub ##cellular mechanisms and use similar trafficking pathways for successful entry . anti ##vira ##l strategies targeting early steps of infection are therefore appealing , particularly when the probability for successful interference through a common step is highest . we describe here potent inhibitor ##y effects on content release and infection by chi ##meric vs ##v containing the envelope proteins of e ##bo ##v ( vs ##v - e ##bo ##v ) or sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( vs ##v - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) eli ##cite ##d by api ##lim ##od and va ##cu ##olin - 1 , small molecule inhibitors of the main end ##osomal ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol - 3 - phosphate / ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol 5 - kinase , pi ##k ##fy ##ve . we also describe potent inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strain 2019 - nc ##ov / usa - wa ##1 / 2020 by api ##lim ##od . these results define new tools for studying the intra ##cellular trafficking of pathogen ##s eli ##cite ##d by inhibition of pi ##k ##fy ##ve kinase and suggest the potential for targeting this kinase in developing a small - molecule anti ##vira ##l against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##bot ##h gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms and fe ##cal shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna have been frequently observed in co ##vid - 19 patients . however , whether sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replicate in the human int ##est ##ine and its clinical relevance to potential fe ##cal - oral transmission remain unclear . here , we demonstrate productive infection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in ace ##2 + mature enter ##ocytes in human small int ##estinal enter ##oids . in addition to t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , another mu ##cos ##a - specific ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se , t ##mp ##rs ##s ##4 , also enhanced sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike fu ##so ##genic activity and mediated viral entry into host cells . however , newly synthesized viruses released into the int ##estinal lu ##men were rapidly inactivated by human colon ##ic fluids and no infectious virus was recovered from the stool specimens of co ##vid - 19 patients . our results highlight the int ##est ##ine as a potential site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication , which may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression .  
abstract ##the current corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic is caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus and is still spreading rapidly worldwide . full - genome - sequence computational analysis of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adapt ##ability mechanisms more accurately , as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prop ##hyl ##actic strategy . in this study , we used population genetics analysis to in ##fer the mutation rate and plausible rec ##om ##bina ##tion events that may have contributed to the evolution of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . furthermore , we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection . the gen ##omic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co - localized with regions in which rec ##om ##bina ##tion from non - human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past . our results suggest that the pang ##olin corona ##virus genome may have contributed to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome by rec ##om ##bina ##tion with the bat corona ##virus genome . however , we find evidence for additional rec ##om ##bina ##tion events that involve corona ##virus genome ##s from other hosts , i . e . , hedge ##hog and sparrow . even though rec ##om ##bina ##tion events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed , due to the high similarity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s , we in ##fer that rec ##om ##bina ##tions may have recently occurred within human hosts using a link ##age di ##se ##quil ##ib ##rium analysis . in addition , we employed an approximate bay ##esian computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 populations that have infected european , asian and northern american co ##hort ##s , and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed poly ##morphism patterns in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s .  
abstract ##we describe fifteen major mutation events from 2 , 05 ##8 high - quality sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s deposited up to march 31st , 2020 . these events define five major clade ##s ( g , i , s , d and v ) of globally - circulating viral populations , representing 85 . 7 % of all sequence ##d cases , which we can identify using a 10 nu ##cle ##otide genetic class ##ifier or bar ##code . we applied this bar ##code to 4 , 000 additional genome ##s deposited between march 31st and april 15th and classified successfully 95 . 6 % of the clade ##s demonstrating the utility of this approach . an analysis of amino acid variation in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or ##fs provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host - entry and genome replication . the systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s of circulating virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic strategies to manage and contain the virus and , also , with available e ##ffi ##ca ##cious anti ##vira ##ls and vaccines , aid in the monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent . the bar ##code will add the necessary genetic resolution to facilitate tracking and monitoring of infection clusters to distinguish imported and indigenous cases and thereby aid public health measures seeking to interrupt transmission chains without the requirement for real - time complete genome ##s sequencing .  
abstract ##to identify potential therapeutic stop - gaps for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , we evaluated a library of 1 , 670 approved and reference compounds in an un ##bia ##sed , cellular image - based screen for their ability to suppress the broad impacts of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus on ph ##eno ##mic profiles of human renal co ##rti ##cal ep ##ith ##elial cells using deep learning . in our ass ##ay , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir is the only anti ##vira ##l tested with strong efficacy , neither ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e nor hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e have any beneficial effect in this human cell model , and a small number of compounds not currently being pursued clinical ##ly for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have efficacy . we observed weak but beneficial class effects of β - block ##ers , mt ##or / pi ##3 ##k inhibitors and vitamin d analogue ##s and a mild amp ##li ##fication of the viral ph ##eno ##type with β - ago ##nist ##s .  
it is of paramount importance to evaluate the prevalence of both as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection and their antibody response profile . here , we performed a pilot study to assess the levels of anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies in samples taken from 49 ##1 pre - epidemic individuals , 51 patients from hop ##ital bi ##cha ##t ( paris ) , 209 pau ##ci - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals in the french o ##ise region and 200 contemporary o ##ise blood donors . two in - house elisa ass ##ays , that recognize the full - length nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ( n ) or trim ##eric spike ( s ) ec ##to ##dom ##ain were implemented . we also developed two novel ass ##ays : the s - flow ass ##ay , which is based on the recognition of s at the cell surface by flow - cy ##tom ##et ##ry , and the lips ass ##ay that recognizes diverse antigen ##s ( including s ##1 or n c - terminal domain ) by im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation . overall , the results obtained with the four ass ##ays were similar , with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use . high antibody ti ##ters were associated with neutral ##isation activity , assessed using infectious sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or lent ##iv ##ira ##l - s pseudo ##type ##s . in hospitalized patients , ser ##oco ##n ##version and neutral ##isation occurred on 5 - 14 days post sy ##mpt ##om onset , confirming previous studies . ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity was detected in 29 % of pau ##ci - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals within 15 days post - symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of co ##vid cases . altogether , our ass ##ays allow for a broad evaluation of sar ##s - co ##v ##2 ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce and antibody prof ##iling in different population subset ##s .  
abstract ##a global cross - discipline effort is ongoing to character ##ize the evolution of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus and generate reliable ep ##ide ##mi ##ological models of its diffusion . to this end , ph ##yl ##ogen ##omic approaches leverage acc ##um ##ulating gen ##omic mutations as bar ##codes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases . yet , such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage , whereas a complex sub ##line ##age architecture is often observed within single hosts . furthermore , most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling , as witnessed in most countries currently affected by the epidemic ##s . we here introduce a new framework for the characterization of viral ( sub ) lineage evolution and transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which considers both cl ##onal and intra - host minor variants and exploits the achievements of cancer evolution research to account for mutation accumulation and uncertainty in the data . the application of our approach to 18 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 samples for which raw sequencing data are available reveals a high - resolution ph ##yl ##ogen ##omic model , which confirms and improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co - occurrence of minor variants , uncover ##ing likely infection paths among hosts harbor ##ing the same viral lineage . our findings confirm a significant increase of gen ##omic diversity of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in time , which is reflected in minor variants , and show that standard methods may struggle when handling data ##set ##s with important sampling limitations . importantly , our framework allows to pin ##point minor variants that might be positively selected across distinct lineage ##s and regions of the viral genome under pu ##ri ##fying selection , thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines . in particular , minor variant g . 290 ##39 ##a > u , detected in multiple viral lineage ##s and valid ##ated on an independent data ##set , shows that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can lose its main nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes , raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the c - terminus of this protein . to conclude , we advocate the use of our framework in combination with data - driven ep ##ide ##mi ##ological models , to deliver a high - precision platform for pathogen detection , surveillance and analysis .  
abstract ##the pan ##de ##mic of a newly emerging corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe pneumonia disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , is threatening global health . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies suggested that bats are the natural reservoir hosts for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , however , the host range of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the identity of intermediate hosts facilitating the transmission to humans remains unknown . corona ##virus – receptor interaction is a key genetic deter ##mina ##nt of the host range , cross - species transmission , and tissue tr ##op ##ism . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 uses ace ##2 as the receptor to enter the cells in a species - dependent manner , and it has been shown that human , palm ci ##vet , pig and bat ace ##2 can support virus entry , but mouse ace ##2 cannot . in this study , we aimed to character ##ize ace ##2 from a diversity of species for its ability to support viral entry . we found that ace ##2 is expressed in a wide range of host species , with high conservation especially in mammals . by analyzing critical amino acid residues in ace ##2 for virus entry , based on the well - characterized sar ##s - co ##v spike protein interaction with ace ##2 ( human , bat , palm ci ##vet , pig and fe ##rret ace ##2 ) , we found approximately eighty ace ##2 proteins from mammals could potentially function as the receptor to media ##te sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry . functional ass ##ays showed that 44 of these mammalian ace ##2 or ##th ##olo ##gs , including domestic animals , pet animals , livestock animals and even animals in the zoo or aqua ##ria , could bind viral spike protein and support sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry . in summary , our study demonstrated that ace ##2 from a diversity of animal species could be utilized by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to media ##te viral entry , indicating it has a broad host range and highlighted that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized , emphasizing the necessity to monitor the susceptible hosts , especially their potential of cross - species , which could prevent the future outbreak ##s .  
abstract ##al ##th ##ough infection by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 , is spreading rapidly worldwide , no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating co ##vid - 19 . we previously found that na ##fa ##most ##at me ##sy ##late , an existing drug used for di ##sse ##minated intra ##vas ##cular coa ##gul ##ation ( di ##c ) , effectively blocked mer ##s - co ##v s protein - initiated cell fusion by targeting t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , and inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v infection of human lung ep ##ith ##eli ##um - derived cal ##u - 3 cells . here we established a quantitative fusion ass ##ay dependent on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein , ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 , and found that na ##fa ##most ##at me ##sy ##late potent ##ly inhibit ##ed the fusion while cam ##osta ##t me ##sy ##late was about 10 - fold less active . furthermore , na ##fa ##most ##at me ##sy ##late blocked sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection of cal ##u - 3 cells with an ec ##50 around 10 nm , which is below its average blood concentration after intra ##ven ##ous administration through continuous in ##fusion . these findings , together with accumulated clinical data regarding its safety , make na ##fa ##most ##at a likely candidate drug to treat co ##vid - 19 .

abstract ##the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic is the most significant public health issue in recent history . its causal agent , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , has evolved rapidly since its first emergence in december 2019 . mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment , and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission , disease manifestation , and the efficacy of treatment and va ##cci ##nation . using the complete sequences of 1 , 93 ##2 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s , we examined the gen ##omic , geographic and temporal distributions of aged , new , and frequent mutations of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains , which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents . mutations in the form of single nu ##cle ##otide variations ( s ##n ##vs ) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters . link ##age di ##se ##quil ##ib ##rium , ha ##pl ##otype structure , evolutionary process , global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutation ##al history . additionally , we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatal ##ity , and this correlation had strengthened with time , suggesting an important role of s ##n ##vs on disease outcomes . this study suggests that s ##n ##vs may become an important consideration in virus detection , clinical treatment , drug design , and vaccine development to avoid target shifting , and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pan ##de ##mic . significance statement ##mut ##ation is the driving force of evolution for viruses like sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the causal agent of co ##vid - 19 . in this study , we discovered that the genome of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form . these mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2 . 5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths . we found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can character ##ize the six main clusters of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 strains . in addition , we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatal ##ity of co ##vid - 19 patients . understanding mutations in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and va ##cci ##nation .

abstract ##the urgent need for massive ##ly scaled clinical or surveillance testing for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has necessitated a rec ##ons ##ider ##ation of the methods by which respiratory samples are collected , transported , processed and tested . conventional testing for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab , storage of the sw ##ab during transport in universal transport medium ( ut ##m ) , extraction of rna , and quantitative reverse transcription pc ##r ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) . as testing has scaled across the world , supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire work ##flow . here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the ut ##m storage and rna extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing . using paired mid - tu ##rbin ##ate sw ##ab ##s self - collected by 11 individuals with previously established sar ##s - co ##v - 2 po ##sit ##ivity , we performed a comparison of conventional ( sw ##ab → ut ##m → rna extraction → rt - q ##pc ##r ) vs . simplified ( direct el ##ution from dry sw ##ab → rt - q ##pc ##r ) protocols . our results suggest that dry sw ##ab ##s el ##uted directly into a simple buffer ##ed solution ( te ) can support molecular detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 via end ##point rt - q ##pc ##r without substantially com ##promising sensitivity . although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary , these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified work ##flow that could support massive ##ly scaled testing for co ##vid - 19 control .  
abstract ##the final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel corona ##virus in the human population . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society . measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus - infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available , i . e . real - time reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) . many commercial kits have recently become available , but their performance has not yet been independently assessed . the aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected rt - pc ##r kits from seven different manufacturers ( alton ##a diagnostic ##s , b ##gi , ce ##rte ##st bio ##tec , k ##h medical , prime ##rdes ##ign , r - bio ##pha ##rm ag , and see ##gen ##e ) . we used serial dil ##ution ##s of viral rna to establish pc ##r efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection ( lo ##d ##9 ##5 % ) . furthermore , we ran a panel of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - positive clinical samples ( n = 16 ) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity . finally , we used clinical samples positive for non - corona ##virus respiratory viral infections ( n = 6 ) and a panel of rna from related human corona ##virus ##es to evaluate ass ##ay specific ##ity . pc ##r efficiency was ≥ ##9 ##6 % for all ass ##ays and the estimated lo ##d ##9 ##5 % varied within a 6 - fold range . using clinical samples , we observed some variations in detection rate between kits . importantly , none of the ass ##ays showed cross - react ##ivity with other respiratory ( corona ) viruses , except as expected for the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 e - gene . we conclude that all rt - pc ##r kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostic ##s of co ##vid - 19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories .  
many countries are currently in a lock ##down state due to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . one key aspect to transition safely out of lock ##down is to continuously test the population for infected subjects . currently , detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse - transcription pc ##r ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) and requires dedicated professionals and equipment . here , we developed a protocol based on reverse transcribed loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) for detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , directly from crude nose and throat sw ##ab ##s . we applied this protocol to over 180 suspected patients , and determined its specific ##ity and sensitivity by comparison to their rt - q ##pc ##r results . in addition , we further succeeded to apply the protocol on self - sampled saliva from confirmed cases . since the proposed protocol provides results on - the - spot , and can detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from saliva , it can allow simple and continuous surveillance of the community .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has caused more than 200 , 000 reported co ##vid - 19 cases in spain resulting in more than 20 , 800 deaths as of april 21 , 2020 . fae ##cal shed ##ding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna from co ##vid - 19 patients has extensively been reported . therefore , we investigated the occurrence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna in six wastewater treatments plants ( w ##wt ##ps ) serving the major municipalities within the region of mu ##rc ##ia ( spain ) , the area with the lowest co ##vid - 19 prevalence within iberian peninsula . firstly , an aluminum hydro ##xide ads ##or ##ption - precipitation concentration method was tested using a por ##cine corona ##virus ( por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea virus , pe ##d ##v ) and meng ##ov ##irus ( mg ##v ) . the procedure resulted in average recover ##ies of 10 . 90 and 10 . 85 % in in ##fl ##uen ##t water and 3 . 29 and 6 . 19 in e ##ff ##lu ##ent water samples for pe ##d ##v and mg ##v , respectively . then , the method was used to monitor the occurrence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from march 12 to april 14 , 2020 in in ##fl ##uen ##t , secondary and tertiary e ##ff ##lu ##ent water samples . by using the real - time rt - pc ##r ( rt - q ##pc ##r ) diagnostic panel valid ##ated by us cdc that targets three regions of the virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) gene , we estimated quan ##ti ##fication of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna ti ##ters in un ##tre ##ated wastewater waters of 5 . 38 log gen ##omic copies / l on average . two secondary water samples resulted positive ( 2 out of 18 ) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative ( 0 out 12 ) . this environmental surveillance data were compared to declared co ##vid - 19 cases at municipality level , revealing that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was circulating among the population even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewater ##s have been sampled . the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of co ##vid - 19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population . at this point , this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool , designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its corona ##virus lock ##down .  
abstracts ##ars co ##v - 2 has particularly been efficient in ensuring that entire countries are brought to a stands ##till . with rep ##er ##cus ##sions ranging from rampant mortality , fear , paranoia and economic recession the virus has brought together countries in order to look at possible therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures . with prop ##hyl ##actic interventions possibly months away from particularly being effective , a sl ##ew of measures and possibilities concerning design of vaccines are being worked upon . we attempt a structure based approach utilizing a combination of ep ##ito ##pe prediction servers to develop a multi - ep ##ito ##pe based subunit vaccine that involves the two major domains of the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s co ##v - 2 ( s ##1 and s ##2 ) coupled with a substantially effective chi ##meric ad ##ju ##vant acting as a tri ##ago ##nist to substantially create stable vaccine construct ##s through md simulations . the designed construct ##s are evaluated based on their docking with toll like receptor ( t ##lr ) 4 . our findings provide ep ##ito ##pe - based peptide fragment which can be potential candidates for development of vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ##di ##ffer ##ent treatments are currently used for clinical management of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , but little is known about their efficacy yet . here we present ongoing results to compare currently available drugs for a variety of diseases to find out if they counter ##act sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - induced cy ##top ##athic effect in vitro . our goal is to prior ##iti ##ze anti ##vira ##l activity to provide a solid evidence - driven rational ##e for forthcoming clinical trials . since the most effective anti ##vira ##l approaches are usually based on combined the ##ra ##pies that tackle the viral life cycle at different stages , we are also testing combinations of drugs that may be critical to reduce the emergence of resistant viruses . we will provide results as soon as they become available , so data should be interpreted with caution , clearly understanding the limitations of the in vitro model , that may not always reflect what could happen in vivo . thus , our goal is to test the most active anti ##vira ##ls identified in adequate animal models infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , to add more information about possible in vivo efficacy . in turn , successful anti ##vira ##ls could be tested in clinical trials as treatments for infected patients , but also as pre - exposure prop ##hyl ##ax ##is to avoid novel infections until an effective and safe vaccine is developed .

abstract ##the ongoing corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic is a serious threat to global public health , and impose ##s severe burden ##s on the entire human society . the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) can cause severe respiratory illness and death . currently , there are no specific anti ##vira ##l drugs that can treat co ##vid - 19 . several vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are being actively developed by research groups around the world . the surface s ( spike ) protein and the highly expressed internal n ( nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 are widely considered as promising candidates for vaccines . in order to guide the design of an effective vaccine , we need experimental data on these potential ep ##ito ##pe candidates . in this study , we mapped the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ( id ) sites of s protein using sera samples collected from recently discharged co ##vid - 19 patients . the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s protein - specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered co ##vid - 19 patients were strongly correlated with the neutral ##ising antibody ti ##tres . we used ep ##ito ##pe mapping to determine the landscape of id sites of s protein , which identified nine linear ##ized b cell id sites . four out of the nine id sites were found in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) . further analysis showed that these id sites are potential high - affinity sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibody binding sites . peptide ##s containing two out of the nine sites were tested as vaccine candidates against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in a mouse model . we detected ep ##ito ##pe - specific antibodies and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - neutral ##ising activity in the im ##mun ##ised mice . this study for the first time provides human ser ##ological data for the design of vaccines against co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract ##the current sar ##s co ##vid - 19 epidemic spread appears to be influenced by ethnic ##al , geographical and sex - related factors that may involve genetic su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to diseases . similar to sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 exploits ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as a receptor to invade cells , notably type ii al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells . importantly , ace ##2 gene is highly poly ##morphic . here we have used in si ##lic ##o tools to analyze the possible impact of ace ##2 single - nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) on the interaction with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . we found that s ##19 ##p ( common in african people ) and k ##26 ##r ( common in european people ) were , among the most diffuse ##d s ##np ##s worldwide , the only two s ##np ##s that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ace ##2 with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike . fired ##ock simulations demonstrated that while s ##19 ##p may decrease , k ##26 ##r might increase the ace ##2 affinity for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 spike . this finding suggests that the s ##19 ##p may genetically protect , and k ##26 ##r may pre ##dis ##pose to more severe sar ##s - co ##v - 2 disease .  
abstract ##the infection corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is caused by a virus classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . at cellular level , virus infection initiate ##s with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 engages ace ##2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se 2 ( t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 ) for s protein pri ##ming . t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogen ##esis in the infected host . understanding how t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to influenza and corona ##virus infections . here , we systematically analyzed coding - region variants in t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 and the e ##q ##tl variants , which may affect the gene expression , to compare the gen ##omic characteristics of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 among different populations . our findings suggest that the lung - specific e ##q ##tl variants may con ##fer different su ##sc ##ept ##ibility or response to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions . in particular , we found that the e ##q ##tl variant rs ##35 ##0 ##7 ##40 ##65 is associated with high expression of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 but with a low expression of the inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - α / β - ind ##ucible gene , mx ##1 , sp ##lic ##ing iso ##form . thus , these subjects could account for a more su ##sc ##ept ##ibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular anti ##vira ##l response .  
summary ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) emerge as zoo ##nos ##es and cause severe disease in humans , demonstrated by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( co ##vid - 19 ) pan ##de ##mic . rna rec ##om ##bina ##tion is required during normal co ##v replication for sub ##gen ##omic mrna ( sg ##m ##rna ) synthesis and generates defective viral genome ##s ( d ##v ##gs ) of unknown function . however , the deter ##mina ##nts and patterns of co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##tion are unknown . here , we show that diver ##gent β - co ##vs sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , mer ##s - co ##v , and mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) perform extensive rna rec ##om ##bina ##tion in culture , generating similar patterns of rec ##om ##bina ##tion junctions and diverse populations of d ##v ##gs and sg ##m ##rna ##s . we demonstrate that the co ##v proof ##rea ##ding non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein ( ns ##p ##14 ) 3 ’ - to - 5 ’ ex ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se ( ns ##p ##14 - ex ##on ) is required for normal co ##v rec ##om ##bina ##tion and that its genetic ina ##ct ##ivation causes significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of rec ##om ##bina ##tion in both infected cells and released vi ##rion ##s . thus , ns ##p ##14 - ex ##on is a key deter ##mina ##nt of both high fidelity co ##v replication and rec ##om ##bina ##tion , and thereby represents a highly - conserved and vulnerable target for virus inhibition and at ##ten ##uation .  
abstracts ##ever ##e acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is the ca ##usa ##tive agent of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . the rapid , sensitive and specific diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by fast and una ##mb ##ig ##uous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding the current outbreak . since the current testing capacity by conventional pc ##r based methods is insufficient because of shortages of supplies such as rna extraction kits and pc ##r re ##age ##nts , alternative and / or complementary testing ass ##ays should be developed . here , we exploit the potential of targeted mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry based pro ##te ##omic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnostic testing capacity . we have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring ( pr ##m ) on an orbit ##ra ##p eclipse mass spec ##trom ##eter for target try ##ptic peptide ##s of several sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins from a sample of virus infected ve ##ro cells . for nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid - at ##tom ##ole range ( 0 . 9 × 10 ##−1 ##2 g ) , which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10 , 000 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 particles , under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macro ##mo ##le ##cular virus particles . whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection in patient material such as sw ##ab ##s or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research . if yes , mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample through ##put .  
background : the co ##vid - 19 disease , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , is a rapidly emerging pan ##de ##mic which has enforced extreme containment measures worldwide . in the absence of a vaccine or efficient treatment , cost - effective ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveillance strategies are urgently needed . methods : here , we have used rt - q ##pc ##r for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection in a series of longitudinal metropolitan wastewater ##s samples collected during the earliest stages of the epidemic in the region of valencia , spain . results : we were able to consistently detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna in samples taken when communicated cases in that region were only inc ##ip ##ient . we also find that the wastewater viral rna context increased rapidly and anticipated the subsequent ascent in the number of declared cases . interpretation : our results strongly suggest that the virus was undergoing community transmission earlier than previously believed , and show that wastewater analysis is a sensitive and cost - effective strategy for co ##vid - 19 ep ##ide ##mi ##ological surveillance . routine implementation of this surveillance tool would significantly improve our prepared ##ness against new or re - occurring viral outbreak ##s .

summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concert ##ed and global approaches to better understand the virus in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches to stop the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic and to better prepare against potential future emergence of novel pan ##de ##mic viruses . although sar ##s - co ##v - 2 primarily targets cells of the lung ep ##ith ##eli ##um causing respiratory infection and path ##ologies , there is growing evidence that the int ##estinal ep ##ith ##eli ##um is also infected . however , the importance of the enter ##ic phase of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for virus - induced path ##ologies , spreading and pro ##gno ##sis remains unknown . here , using both colon - derived cell lines and primary non - transformed colon organ ##oids , we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 life ##cycle in human int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells . our results demonstrate that human int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells fully support sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , replication and production of infectious de - novo virus particles . importantly , we identified int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells as the best culture model to prop ##aga ##te sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we found that viral infection eli ##cite ##d an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where , interesting ##ly , type iii inter ##fer ##on mediated response was significantly more efficient at controlling sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication and spread compared to type i inter ##fer ##on . taken together , our data demonstrate that human int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial cells are a productive site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication and suggest that the enter ##ic phase of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may participate in the path ##ologies observed in co ##vid - 19 patients by contributing in increasing patient vi ##rem ##ia and by fuel ##ing an ex ##ace ##rba ##ted cy ##tok ##ine response .  
abstract ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es belong to a group of enveloped , positive - single stranded rna viruses that are known to cause severe respiratory distress in animals and humans . the current sar ##s corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s co ##v - 2 ) pan ##de ##mic has caused more than 2 , 000 , 000 infections globally and nearly 200 , 000 deaths . corona ##virus ##es enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and / or via fusion of the viral envelope with end ##osomal membranes after end ##oc ##yt ##osis of the virus into end ##oso ##mes . previous results with sar ##s and mer ##s co ##v have shown that the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is a major deter ##mina ##nt of virus in ##fect ##ivity and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . here ##in , we show that expression of sar ##s co ##v - 2 s ( s - n ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein after transient trans ##fect ##ion of african green monkey kidney ( ve ##ro ) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the sar ##s s ( s - o ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . s - n expression was detected intra ##cellular ##ly and on trans ##fect ##ed ve ##ro cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multi ##nu ##cle ##ated cells ( sync ##yt ##ia ) by 48 hours post trans ##fect ##ion . these results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive sync ##yt ##ial formation in lung tissues of co ##vid - 19 patients . this differential s - n versus s - o - mediated cell fusion suggests that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is able to spread from cell - to - cell much more efficiently than sar ##s effectively avoiding extra ##cellular spaces and neutral ##izing antibodies . a systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit s - n and s - o cell fusion revealed that the fda approved hiv - pro ##tea ##se inhibitor , ne ##lf ##ina ##vir me ##sy ##late ( vi ##race ##pt ) drastically inhibit ##ed s - n and s - o - mediated cell fusion in a dose - dependent manner . complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micro ##mo ##lar concentration . computational modeling and in si ##lic ##o docking experiments suggested the possibility that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir may bind inside the s trim ##er structure , pro ##xi ##mal to the s ##2 amino terminus directly inhibit ##ing s - n and s - o - mediated membrane fusion . also , it is possible that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir me ##sy ##late acts on cellular processes to inhibit s pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing . these results warrant further investigations of the potential of ne ##lf ##ina ##vir me ##sy ##late as an anti ##vira ##l drug ,

multiple laboratory developed tests and commercially available ass ##ays have emerged to meet diagnostic needs related to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . to date , there is limited comparison data for these different testing platforms . we compared the analytical performance of a laboratory developed test ( ld ##t ) developed in our clinical laboratory based on cdc prime ##r sets and four commercially available , fda emergency use authorized ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( ce ##ph ##ei ##d , dia ##sor ##in , ho ##logic panther , and roche co ##bas ) on a total of 169 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s . the ld ##t and ce ##ph ##ei ##d xp ##ert xp ##ress sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ass ##ays were the most sensitive ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with 100 % agreement across specimens . the ho ##logic panther fusion , dia ##sor ##in simple ##xa , and roche co ##bas 680 ##0 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of our cdc - based ld ##t ass ##ay . all ass ##ays were 100 % specific , using our cdc - based ld ##t as the gold standard . our results provide initial test performance characteristics for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a public health emergency .  
background : the pan ##de ##mic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has tremendous consequences for our societies . knowledge of the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatal ##ity rate ( if ##r ) . these measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions . blood donors comprise approximately 4 . 7 % of the similarly aged population of denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country . the objective of this study was to perform real - time ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections and the population based if ##r . methods : all danish blood donors aged 17 - 69 years giving blood april 6 to 17 were tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin m and g antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test . antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the if ##r was calculated . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce was adjusted for ass ##ay sensitivity and specific ##ity taking the uncertain ##ties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) . results : the first 9 , 49 ##6 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of 1 . 7 % ( ci : 0 . 9 - 2 . 3 ) was calculated . the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce differed across areas . using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined if ##r in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100 , 000 ( ci : 59 - 154 ) infections . conclusions : the if ##r was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce data . the if ##r , including only individuals with no como ##rb ##idi ##ty , is likely several fold lower than the current estimate . this may have implications for risk mit ##iga ##tion . we have initiated real - time nationwide anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic .  
abstract background nova ##fer ##on , a novel protein drug approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in china , exhibits potent anti ##vira ##l activities . we aimed to determine the anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 effects of nova ##fer ##on in vitro , and conducted a random ##ized , open - label , parallel group study to explore the anti ##vira ##l effects of nova ##fer ##on for co ##vid - 19 . methods in laboratory , the inhibition of nova ##fer ##on on viral replication in cells infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 entry into healthy cells was determined . anti ##vira ##l effects of nova ##fer ##on were evaluated in co ##vid - 19 patients with treatment of nova ##fer ##on , nova ##fer ##on plus lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r , or lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r . the primary end ##point was the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance rates on day 6 of treatment , and the secondary end ##point was the time to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance in co ##vid - 19 patients results nova ##fer ##on inhibit ##ed the viral replication in infected cells ( ec ##50 = 1 . 02 ng / ml ) , and protected healthy cells from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ( ec ##50 = 0 . 1 ng / ml ) . results from the 89 enrolled co ##vid - 19 patients showed that both nova ##fer ##on and nova ##fer ##on plus lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r groups had significantly higher sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance rates on day 6 than the lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r group ( 50 . 0 % vs . 24 . 1 % , p = 0 . 04 ##00 , and 60 . 0 % vs . 24 . 1 % , p = 0 . 00 ##53 ) . median time to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance were 6 days , 6 days , and 9 days for three groups respectively , suggesting a 3 - day ##red ##uc ##tion of time to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 clearance in both nova ##fer ##on and nova ##fer ##on plus lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r groups compared with lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r group . conclusions nova ##fer ##on exhibited anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 effects in vitro and in co ##vid - 19 patients . these data justified the further evaluation of nova ##fer ##on . key words : co ##vid - 19 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , nova ##fer ##on , anti ##vira ##l drug , lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r 
the current emergence of corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov or co ##vid - 19 ) puts the world in threat . 2019 - nc ##ov remains the outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v 2002 - 2003 . the structural research on the receptor recognition by sar ##s - co ##v has identified the key interactions between sar ##s - co ##v spike protein and its host receptor , also known as ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . it controls both the cross - species and human - to - human transmissions of sar ##s - co ##v . in this article , we have considered the infection dynamics of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in the acute stage . our aim is to propose and anal ##yse a mathematical model for investigating the effect of ct ##l responses over the viral mutation to control the viral infection when a post - infection vaccine is administered at regular intervals . dynamics of the system with and without impulse ##s have been anal ##yse ##d using qu ##ali ##tative theory . main findings are supported through numerical simulations .  
the alarm ##ing spread of the pan ##de ##mic corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus is requiring several measures to reduce the risk of con ##tag ##ion . every successful strategy in controlling sar ##s - co ##v ##2 infection depends on the timely viral diagnosis which should include as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers . consequently , strategies to increase the through ##put for clinical laboratories to conduct large - scale diagnostic testing are urgently needed . here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus could be convenient ##ly applied to poole ##d samples obtained from different subjects . we suggest that a two - step sequential pool ##ing procedure could identify positive subjects , ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time . simulation data are used to assess the efficiency , in terms of number of required tests , both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations when ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical data are used to create an informed version of the pool ##ing . different scenarios are examined in the simulations to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for the virus frequency . our results allow to custom ##ize the pool ##ing strategy according to the specific characteristics of the co ##hort to be tested .  
we analyze confirmed cases and new hospital ##izations in wisconsin in the weeks surrounding the april 7 , 2020 election , and find no evidence of a surge in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission .  
increased attention to analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( co ##v - 19 ) positive test frequency data is essential for achievement of better knowledge of the natural history of the virus in human populations , improved accuracy of co ##v - 19 ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data , and development of public response policies that are better crafted to address the current co ##v - 19 - induced global crisis . a statistical analysis of currently available positive test frequency data reveals a surprisingly uniform relationship between the number of co ##v - 19 test performed and the number of positive tests obtained . the uniform ##ity is particularly striking for united states co ##v - 19 test data . such observations warrant closer evaluation of other factors , besides virus spread , that may also contribute to the nature of the corona ##virus pan ##de ##mic . these include indigenous co ##v - 19 and the quality of co ##v - 19 testing .  
abstract ##co ##vid - 19 , caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , is an influenza - like disease with a respiratory route of transmission , yet clinical evidence suggests that the int ##est ##ine may present another viral target organ . indeed , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is highly expressed on differentiated enter ##ocytes . in human small int ##estinal organ ##oids , enter ##ocytes were readily infected by sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as demonstrated by con ##fo ##cal - and electron - microscopy . consequently , significant ti ##ters of infectious viral particles were measured . mrna expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program . we conclude that int ##estinal ep ##ith ##eli ##um supports sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication . one sentence summary ##sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection of enter ##ocytes in human small int ##estinal organ ##oids 
abstract ##ear ##ly detection of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is key to managing the current global pan ##de ##mic , as evidence shows the virus is most con ##tag ##ious on or before sy ##mpt ##om onset ##1 , 2 . here , we introduce a low - cost , high - through ##put method for diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , dubbed pathogen - oriented low - cost assembly & re - sequencing ( polar ) , that enhance ##s sensitivity by aiming to amp ##li ##fy the entire sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome rather than targeting particular viral lo ##ci , as in typical rt - pc ##r ass ##ays . to achieve this goal , we combine a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 enrichment method developed by the art ##ic network ( https : / / art ##ic . network / ) with short - read dna sequencing and de novo genome assembly . we are able to re ##lia ##bly ( > 95 % accuracy ) detect sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalent ##s per mill ##ili ##ter , better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the us food and drug administration . at higher concentrations , we are able to re ##lia ##bly assemble the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome in the sample , often with no gaps and perfect accuracy . such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes / no diagnostic , and can help identify vaccine and drug targets . using polar , a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8 - hour experiment , at a cost of ~ $ 30 / patient , enabling a 24 - hour turn ##around with sequencing and data analysis time included . further testing and ref ##ine ##ment will likely enable greater enhancement ##s in the sensitivity of the above approach .  
abstracts ##ever ##e respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection presents an immense global health problem . spike ( s ) protein of corona ##virus is the primary deter ##mina ##nt of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain . while tissue tr ##op ##ism , host range , and pathogen ##esis of corona ##virus are primarily controlled by the interaction of s protein with the cell receptor , it is possible that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activation of s protein by host cell pro ##tea ##ses also plays a decisive role . the host - cell pro ##tea ##ses have shown to be involved in the pro ##te ##ol ##ysis of s protein and cl ##ea ##ving it into two functional subunit ##s , s ##1 and s ##2 , during the mat ##uration process . in the present study , the interaction of s protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with different host pro ##tea ##ses like fur ##in , cat ##he ##ps ##in b , and pl ##as ##min has been analyzed . incorporation of the fur ##in cleavage site ( r - r - a - r ) in the s protein in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been studied by mu ##tat ##ing the individual amino acid . our results suggest the poly ##tro ##pic nature of the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . our analysis indicated that a single amino acid substitution in the poly ##bas ##ic cleavage site of s protein per ##tur ##b the binding of cellular pro ##tea ##ses . this mutation study might help to generate an at ##ten ##uated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . besides , targeting of host pro ##tea ##ses by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and to develop its anti ##vira ##l .  
background : ser ##ological tests are crucial tools for assessments of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 exposure , infection and potential immunity . their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate ass ##ay performance data . method : we conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow ass ##ays ( l ##fa ##s ) and two elisa ##s to detect anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 antibodies . the specimen set comprised 130 plasma or serum samples from 80 sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r - positive individuals ; 108 pre - co ##vid - 19 negative controls ; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . samples were blinded and l ##fa results were interpreted by two independent readers , using a standardized intensity scoring system . results : among specimens from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rt - pc ##r - positive individuals , the percent ser ##op ##osi ##tive increased with time interval , peaking at 81 . 8 - 100 . 0 % in samples taken > 20 days after sy ##mpt ##om onset . test specific ##ity ranged from 84 . 3 - 100 . 0 % in pre - co ##vid - 19 specimens . specific ##ity was higher when weak l ##fa bands were considered negative , but this decreased sensitivity . i ##gm detection was more variable than i ##gg , and detection was highest when i ##gm and i ##gg results were combined . agreement between elisa ##s and l ##fa ##s ranged from 75 . 8 - 94 . 8 % . no consistent cross - react ##ivity was observed . conclusion : our evaluation showed het ##ero ##gen ##eous ass ##ay performance . reader training is key to reliable l ##fa performance , and can be tailored for survey goals . informed use of ser ##ology will require evaluation ##s covering the full spectrum of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mild infection to severe disease , and later con ##vale ##sc ##ence . well - designed studies to el ##uc ##ida ##te the mechanisms and ser ##ological co ##rre ##lates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies .  
background : there is substantial disagreement about the level of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection in a population . the disagreement results , in part , from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic people with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detected at a single point . review questions : 1 . amongst people who become infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection ? 2 . amongst people with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection who are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic when diagnosed , what proportion will develop symptoms later ? 3 . what proportion of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic throughout infection , or pre - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic ? methods : rapid living systematic review ( protocol https : / / os ##f . io / 9 ##ew ##ys / ) . we searched pub ##med , em ##base , bio ##r ##xi ##v and med ##r ##xi ##v using a living evidence database of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 literature on 25 . 03 . 2020 . we included studies of people with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diagnosed by reverse transcript ##ase pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) that documented follow - up and sy ##mpt ##om status at the beginning and end of follow - up and modelling studies . study selection , data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second , with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer . we used a common - effect model to synthesis ##e proportions from comparable studies . results : we screened 89 studies and included 11 . we estimated an upper bound for the proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections of 29 % ( 95 % confidence interval 23 to 37 % ) in eight studies . selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies . one statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections at 18 % ( 95 % credibility interval 16 to 20 % ) . estimates of the proportions of pre - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individual in four studies were too het ##ero ##gen ##eous to combine . in modelling studies , 40 - 60 % of all sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections are the result of transmission from pre - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals , with a smaller contribution from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals . conclusions : an intermediate contribution of pre - sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections to overall sar ##s - co ##v -
world health organization ( who ) declared co ##vid - 19 as a pan ##de ##mic disease on march 11 , 2020 . comparison of genome sequences from diverse locations allows us to identify the genetic diversity among viruses which would help in as ##cer ##tain ##ing viral vi ##ru ##lence , disease pathogen ##ici ##ty , origin and spread of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 between countries . the aim of this study is to as ##cer ##tain the genetic diversity among indian sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s . initial examination of the phylogenetic data of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s ( n = 312 ##3 ) from different continents deposited at gi ##sai ##d ( global initiative on sharing all influenza data ) revealed multiple origin for indian isolate ##s . an in - depth analysis of 44 ##9 viral genome ##s derived from samples representing countries from usa , europe , china , east asia , south asia , oceania , middle east regions and india revealed that most indian samples are divided into two clusters ( a and b ) with cluster a showing more similarity to samples from oceania and kuwait and the cluster b grouping with countries from europe , middle east and south asia . diversity analysis of viral clade ##s , which are characterized by specific non - synonymous mutations in viral proteins , discovered that the cluster a indian samples belong to i clade ( v ##37 ##8 ##i in or ##f ##1 ##ab ) , which is an oceania clade with samples having iran connections and the cluster b indian samples belong to g clade ( d ##6 ##14 ##g in spike protein ) , which is an european clade . thus our study identifies that the indian sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses belong to i and g clade ##s with potential origin to be countries mainly from oceania , europe , middle east and south asia regions , which strongly implying the spread of virus through most travelled countries . the study also emphasizes the importance of pathogen gen ##omics through phylogenetic analysis to discover viral genetic diversity and understand the viral transmission dynamics with eventual grasp on viral vi ##ru ##lence and disease pathogen ##esis .  
several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community ( wastewater - based ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , wb ##e ) . during the co ##vid - 19 public health emergency , many reports have described the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna in stool ##s from co ##vid - 19 patients , and a few studies reported the occurrence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in wastewater ##s worldwide . italy is among the world ' s worst - affected countries in the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic , but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in italian wastewater ##s . to this aim , twelve in ##fl ##uen ##t sewage samples , collected between february and april 2020 from wastewater treatment plants in milan and rome , were tested adapting , for concentration , the standard who procedure for pol ##io ##virus surveillance . molecular analysis was undertaken with three nest ##ed protocols , including a newly designed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 specific prime ##r set . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna detection occurred in volumes of 250 ml of wastewater ##s collected in both areas at high ( milan ) and low ( rome ) epidemic circulation , according to clinical data . overall , 6 out of 12 samples were positive . one of the positive results was obtained in a milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified italian case of auto ##cht ##hon ##ous sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the study shows that wb ##e has the potential to be applied to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population .  
abstract ##the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##ron ##oa ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of co ##vid - 19 illness , has caused over 2 million infections worldwide in four months . in sar ##s corona ##virus ##es , the non - structural protein 16 ( ns ##p ##16 ) methyl ##ates the 5 ’ - end of viral ##ly encoded mrna ##s to mimic cellular mrna ##s , thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction . we report here the high - resolution structure of a ter ##nary complex of full - length ns ##p ##16 and ns ##p ##10 of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the presence of co ##gna ##te rna substrate and a methyl donor , s - aden ##os ##yl met ##hi ##oni ##ne . the ns ##p ##16 / ns ##p ##10 het ##ero ##dim ##er was captured in the act of 2 ’ - o methyl ##ation of the rib ##ose sugar of the first nu ##cle ##otide of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mrna . we reveal large conform ##ation ##al changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ter ##nary state . this structure provides new me ##chan ##istic insights into the 2 ’ - o methyl ##ation of the viral mrna cap . we also discovered a distant ##ly located ligand - binding site unique to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that may serve as an alternative target site for anti ##vira ##l development .  
this study explores the diver ##gence pattern of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using whole genome sequences of the isolate ##s from various co ##vid - 19 affected countries . the ph ##yl ##ogen ##omic analysis indicates the presence of at least four distinct groups of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s . the emerge ##nt groups have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in specific proteins . also , this study reveals the differential levels of diver ##gence patterns for the protein coding regions . moreover , we have predicted the impact of structural changes on a couple of important viral proteins via structural modelling techniques . this study further advocates for more viral genetic studies with associated clinical outcomes and hosts response for better understanding of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pathogen ##esis enabling better mit ##iga ##tion of this pan ##de ##mic situation .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic has resulted in widespread mor ##bid ##ity and mortality globally , but with widely variable outcomes . the development of severe disease and mortality is higher in older individuals , males and those with other co - mor ##bid ##ities , and may vary across ethnic groups . however , so far , no host genetic factor has been clearly associated with su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and development of severe disease . to understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ace ##2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor ) during rna virus infection we performed a g ##was for ace ##2 expression in hc ##v - infected liver tissue from 195 individuals . we discovered that poly ##morphism ##s in the host if ##nl region which control expression of if ##nl ##3 and if ##nl ##4 mod ##ulate ace ##2 expression . ace ##2 expression was regulated additionally by age , with a subsidiary effect of co - mor ##bid ##ity . the if ##nl locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well - known inter ##fer ##on - stimulated genes which anti - correlated with ace ##2 transcript levels . the same anti - correlation was found in the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract , a site of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication where inflammation driven inter ##fer ##on - stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ace ##2 expression . the inter ##fer ##on dependent regulation of ace ##2 was identified in a mu ##rine model of sar ##s - co ##v - 1 suggesting conserved regulation of ace ##2 across species . poly ##morphism ##s in the if ##nl region , as well as age , may impact not only on classical anti ##vira ##l responses but also on ace ##2 with potential consequences for clinical outcomes in distinct ethnic groups and with implications for therapeutic interventions .  
the human conduct ##ive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to con ##stra ##in invading respiratory pathogen ##s . the di ##spar ##ate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetic ##s of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses . here , we employed the human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cell ( ha ##ec ) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract , 33 ##° ##c and 37 ##° ##c , respectively , on the viral replication kinetic ##s and host innate immune response dynamics during sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v infections . striking ##ly , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , in contrast to sar ##s - co ##v , replicate ##d more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract , and displayed higher sensitivity to type i and type iii if ##ns than sar ##s - co ##v . time - resolved transcript ##ome analysis highlighted a temperature - dependent induction of if ##n - mediated anti ##vira ##l response , whose amplitude inverse ##ly correlated with the replication kinetic e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies of both sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract . altogether , these data reflect clinical features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v and subsequently , their associated human - to - human transmission e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies . they provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics . this knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) emerged in 2019 as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the novel pan ##de ##mic viral disease co ##vid - 19 . with no approved the ##ra ##pies , this pan ##de ##mic illustrates the urgent need for safe , broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l counter ##me ##as ##ures against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and future emerging co ##vs . we report that re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( rd ##v ) , a mono ##ph ##os ##ph ##ora ##mi ##date pro ##dr ##ug of an aden ##osi ##ne analog , potent ##ly inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication in human lung cells and primary human air ##way ep ##ith ##elial cultures ( ec ##50 = 0 . 01 μ ##m ) . weaker activity was observed in ve ##ro e ##6 cells ( ec ##50 = 1 . 65 μ ##m ) due to their low capacity to meta ##bol ##ize rd ##v . to rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy , we engineered a chi ##meric sar ##s - co ##v encoding the viral target of rd ##v , the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase , of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in mice infected with chi ##meric virus , therapeutic rd ##v administration diminished lung viral load and improved pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals . these data provide substantial evidence that rd ##v is potent ##ly active against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in vitro and in vivo , supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of co ##vid - 19 .  
the magnitude of the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic under ##sco ##res the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine . here we analyzed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequence diversity across 5 , 700 sequences sampled since december 2019 . the spike protein , which is the target im ##mun ##ogen of most vaccine candidates , showed 93 sites with shared poly ##morphism ##s ; only one of these mutations was found in more than 1 % of currently circulating sequences . the minimal diversity found among sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences can be explained by drift and bottle ##neck events as the virus spread away from its original epic ##enter in wu ##han , china . importantly , there is little evidence that the virus has adapted to its human host since december 2019 . our findings suggest that a single vaccine should be e ##ffi ##ca ##cious against current global strains .  
the corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , has become a serious infectious disease affecting human health worldwide and rapidly declared a pan ##de ##mic by who . early , because the urgent need of reliable and rapid sar ##s - co ##v - 2 detection strategies and once the first sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequence was available , several reference laboratories developed rt - q ##pc ##r methods which have been deposited in the who website . only weeks later , after additional sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s were sequence ##d by several unrelated laboratories , the kit gps ##tm co ##vid - 19 dt ##ec - rt - q ##pc ##r test developed by scientific team from genetic pc ##r solutions ##tm ( gps ##tm , ali ##can ##te , spain ) was one of the first commercially available worldwide . the parameters specific ##ity ( inc ##lus ##ivity / ex ##cl ##us ##ivity ) , quantitative phase analysis ( 10 - 106 copies ) , reliability ( repeat ##ability / rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility ) and sensitivity ( detection / quan ##ti ##fication limits ) of this q ##pc ##r kit were valid ##ated with the strict acceptance criteria recommended by the une / en iso 1702 ##5 : 2005 and iso / iec 151 ##8 ##9 : 2012 . diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories , the instituto de sal ##ud carlos iii ( is ##ci ##ii ) , ( madrid , spain ) and the public health england ( ph ##e ; colin ##dale , london , uk ) . the present study approached the in si ##lic ##o specific ##ity of the protocols currently recommended by who ( 16 , 18 , 23 - 27 ) , a recently published rt - q ##pc ##r method , and the gps ##tm co ##vid - 19 dt ##ec - rt - q ##pc ##r test . the analysis suggested the later rt - q ##pc ##r design as the more exclusive by far .  
background : little is known about the natural history of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection or its contribution to infection transmission . methods : we conducted a prospective study at a qu ##aran ##tine centre for co ##vid - 19 in ho chi minh city , vietnam . we enrolled qu ##aran ##tine ##d people with rt - pc ##r - confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , collecting clinical data , travel and contact history , and saliva at en ##rol ##ment and daily nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al throat sw ##ab ##s ( nt ##s ) for rt - pc ##r testing . we compared the natural history and transmission potential of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals . results : between march 10th and april 4th , 2020 , 14 , 000 qu ##aran ##tine ##d people were tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; 49 were positive . of these , 30 participated in the study : 13 ( 43 % ) never had symptoms and 17 ( 57 % ) were sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic . 17 ( 57 % ) participants acquired their infection outside vietnam . compared with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic people were less likely to have detect ##able sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in nt ##s samples collected at en ##rol ##ment ( 8 / 13 ( 62 % ) vs . 17 / 17 ( 100 % ) p = 0 . 02 ) . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna was detected in 20 / 27 ( 74 % ) available saliva ; 7 / 11 ( 64 % ) in the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and 13 / 16 ( 81 % ) in the sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic group ( p = 0 . 56 ) . analysis of the probability of rt - pc ##r po ##sit ##ivity showed as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic participants had faster viral clearance than sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic participants ( p < 0 . 001 for difference over first 19 days ) . this difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow - up . two of the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts . conclusions : as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or nt ##s . nt ##s viral loads fall faster in as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals , but they appear able to transmit the virus to others .  
the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 is the cellular receptor used by sar ##s corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to enter the cell . both corona ##virus use the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of their viral spike protein to interact with ace ##2 . the structural basis of these interactions are already known , forming a dime ##r of ace ##2 with a trim ##er of the spike protein , opening the door to target them to prevent the infection . here we present pep ##i - co ##v ##19 database , a repository of peptide ##s designed to target the interaction between the rd ##b of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and ace ##2 as well as the dime ##rization of ace ##2 mono ##mers . the peptide ##s were modelled using our method pip ##red that uses native elements of the interaction between the targeted protein and co ##gna ##te partner that are subsequently included in the designed peptide ##s . these peptide ##s rec ##ap ##it ##ulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conform ##ations that preserve the key interactions on the interface . pep ##i - co ##vid ##19 database provides an easy and convenient access to this wealth of information to the scientific community with the view of maxim ##izing its potential impact in the development of novel therapeutic agents .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 corona ##virus is driving a global pan ##de ##mic , but its biological mechanisms are less well understood . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is an rna virus whose multiple gen ##omic and sub - gen ##omic rna ( sg ##rna ) transcript ##s hi ##jack the host cell ' s machinery , located across distinct cy ##to ##top ##ic locations . sub ##cellular local ##ization of its viral rna could play important roles in viral replication and host anti ##vira ##l immune response . here we perform computational modeling of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viral rna local ##ization across eight sub ##cellular neighborhoods . we compare hundreds of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s to the human transcript ##ome and other corona ##virus ##es and perform systematic sub - sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals . using state - of - the - art machine learning models , we predict that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna genome and all sg ##rna ##s are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nu ##cle ##ol ##us . the 5 ' and 3 ' viral un ##tra ##ns ##lated regions possess the strongest and most distinct local ##ization signals . we discuss the mitochondrial local ##ization signal in relation to the formation of double - membrane ve ##sic ##les , a critical stage in the corona ##virus life cycle . our computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , a positive - sense rna virus in the family corona ##vir ##idae , has caused the current worldwide pan ##de ##mic , known as corona ##virus disease 2019 or co ##vid - 19 . the definition of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 open reading frames is a key step in del ##ine ##ating targets for va ##cci ##nation and treatment for co ##vid - 19 . here , we report an int ##eg ##rative analysis of three independent direct rna sequencing data ##set ##s of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transcript ##ome . we find strong evidence for variant open reading frames ( or ##fs ) encoded by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rna . a variant transcript for the matrix protein ( m ) lacking its n - terminal trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain , initiated by a tt ##g start cod ##on , is produced by a strong transcription ##al regulatory sequence ( tr ##s ) - mediated junction within the m or ##f and represents up to 19 % of all m or ##fs . sporadic non - canonical junctions in the spike ( s ) or ##f lead to n - terminal tr ##un ##cation ##s that remove the n - terminal and receptor - binding domains from up to 25 % of s or ##fs . surprisingly , nearly all or ##fs from or ##f ##1 ##a identified in these transcript ##ome sequences were variant . these or ##fs contain the first 200 - 800 amino acids of or ##f ##1 ##a and may represent a mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of or ##f ##1 ##a non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins . we show there is strong transcript ##ome and junction ##al support for variant or ##f ##1 ##a or ##fs in independent direct rna sequencing and short - read rna sequencing data ##set ##s , and further show that up to 1 / 3 of these or ##fs are expected to have c - terminal fusion ##s with downstream genes . finally , we show that currently una ##nn ##ota ##ted or ##fs are abundant in the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transcript ##ome . together , these analyses help to el ##uc ##ida ##te the diverse coding potential of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
background : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 most likely evolved from a bat beta - corona ##virus and started in ##fect ##ing humans in december 2019 . since then it has rapidly infected people around the world , with more than 3 million confirmed cases by the end of april 2020 . early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostic ##s and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development . the analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures . however , with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations , significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely . the current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostic ##s , the ##ra ##pies and vaccines . methods : we used the current sequencing archives ( nc ##bi and gi ##sai ##d ) to investigate 5 , 34 ##9 whole genome ##s , looking for evidence of strain divers ##ification and selective pressure . results : we used 3 , 95 ##8 s ##np ##s to build a phylogenetic tree of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clade ##s and six sub - clade ##s , uneven ##ly distributed across the world . we also noted that converge ##nt evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome , showing selection pressures , including on the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ace ##2 receptor . we also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostic ##s from detecting some of the sub - clade ##s . conclusions : the worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimation ##s .  
nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sampling protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) diagnosis guidelines only recommend synthetic fiber sw ##ab ##s . we show that simple and cheap cotton tipped plastic sw ##ab ##s do not inhibit pc ##r and have equivalent performance to rayon sw ##ab ##s . cotton tipped plastic sw ##ab ##s are massive ##ly produced worldwide and would prevent sw ##ab ##s supplies shortage during current high sar ##s - co ##v - 2 testing demands , particularly on developing countries .  
the global pan ##de ##mic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or 2019 - nc ##ov ) has prompted multiple clinical trials to jumps ##tar ##t search for anti - sar ##s - co ##v - 2 the ##ra ##pies from existing drugs , including those with reported in vitro e ##ffi ##ca ##cies as well as those ones that are not known to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , such a ri ##ton ##avi ##r / lo ##pina ##vir and fa ##vil ##avi ##r . here we report that after screening 19 anti ##vira ##l drugs that are either in clinical trials or with proposed activity against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir was the most effective . ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e only effectively protected virus - induced cy ##top ##athic effect at around 30 micro ##mo ##lar with a therapeutic index of 1 . 5 . our findings also show that ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir , led ##ip ##as ##vir , lit ##ona ##vir , lo ##pina ##vir , fa ##vil ##avi ##r , so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir do not have direct anti ##vira ##l effect .

abstract ##with an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoo ##not ##ic strains , new strategies are required to prepare for the next emerge ##nt corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . previously , groups had targeted conserved corona ##virus proteins as a strategy to generate live - at ##ten ##uated vaccine strains against current and future co ##vs . with this in mind , we explored whether manipulation of co ##v ns ##p ##16 , a conserved 2 ’ o methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( mt ##ase ) , could provide a broad at ##ten ##uation platform against future emerge ##nt strains . using the sar ##s - co ##v mouse model , a ns ##p ##16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge , efficacy in the aging host , and potential for rev ##ers ##ion to pathogen ##esis . despite some success , concerns for vi ##ru ##lence in the aged and potential for rev ##ers ##ion makes targeting ns ##p ##16 alone an un ##ten ##able approach . however , combining a 2 ’ o mt ##ase mutation with a previously described co ##v fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous virus challenge , efficacy in aged mice , and no evidence for rev ##ers ##ion . together , the results indicate that targeting the co ##v 2 ’ o mt ##ase in parallel with other conserved at ##ten ##uating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live - at ##ten ##uated corona ##virus vaccines . significance ##eme ##rgen ##t corona ##virus ##es remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreak ##s . however , failure of many previous co ##v vaccine formulation ##s has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune - compromised . this study illustrates that despite success in young models , the ns ##p ##16 mutant carries too much risk for pathogen ##esis and rev ##ers ##ion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand - alone vaccine strategy . importantly , the ns ##p ##16 mutation can be paired with other at ##ten ##uating approaches to provide robust protection from het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge and in vulnerable populations . coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogen ##esis , the study highlights the potential for ns ##p ##16 at ##ten ##uation as a major component of future live - at ##ten ##uated corona ##virus vaccines .

abstract ##tra ##ditional ##ly , the emergence of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) has been attributed to a gain in receptor binding in a new host . our previous work with sar ##s - like viruses argued that bats already harbor co ##vs with the ability to in ##fect humans without adaptation . these results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoo ##not ##ic co ##v . in this work , we describe overcoming host restriction of two mer ##s - like bat co ##vs using ex ##ogen ##ous pro ##tea ##se treatment . we found that the spike protein of pdf ##21 ##80 - co ##v , a mer ##s - like virus found in a uganda ##n bat , could media ##te infection of ve ##ro and human cells in the presence of ex ##ogen ##ous try ##ps ##in . we subsequently show that the bat virus spike can media ##te infection of human gut cells , but is unable to in ##fect human lung cells . using receptor - blocking antibodies , we show that infection with the pdf ##21 ##80 spike does not require mer ##s - co ##v receptor d ##pp ##4 and antibodies developed against the mer ##s spike receptor - binding domain and s ##2 portion are ineffective in neutral ##izing the pdf ##21 ##80 chi ##mer ##a . finally , we found that addition of ex ##ogen ##ous try ##ps ##in also rescues replication of hk ##u ##5 - co ##v , a second mer ##s - like group 2 ##c co ##v . together , these results indicate that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the spike , not receptor binding , is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2 ##c co ##vs . coupled with receptor binding , pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate emergence potential of co ##vs and offer a means to recover previously un ##re ##co ##vera ##ble zoo ##not ##ic co ##v strains . importance ##over ##all , our studies demonstrate that pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es . moving forward , the results argue that both receptor binding and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es . in addition , the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously un ##cu ##lt ##iva ##ble zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus strains and argue that other tissues , including the digest ##ive tract , could be a site for future corona ##virus emergence events in humans .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has plagued the middle east since it was first reported in 2012 . recently , at the end of december 2019 , a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from wu ##han city , hub ##ei province , china , linked to a wet seafood market with a new corona ##virus identified as the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent currently named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . most cases are in mainland china with international spread to 25 countries . the novelty of the virus , the rapid national and international spread , and the lack of therapeutic and prevent ##ative strategies have led the who international health regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as public health emergency of international concern ( ph ##ei ##c ) on january 30 , 2020 . as it relates to countries with the ongoing mer ##s - co ##v community cases and hospital acquired infections , there will be a huge challenge for hc ##ws to deal with both corona ##virus ##es , especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing . this challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with co ##vid - 19 since both corona ##virus ##es have similar presentation . those patients should now be tested for both mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 simultaneously , and with the continuing wide international spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the travel history to china in the last 14 days will be of less significance 
the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( now named as sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 ) caused an outbreak of sar ##s ‐ like illness in the late of december 2019 . at present , the origin , susceptible population , and infection sources already have been clear . 1 , 2 however , the transmission routes , a key step to the epidemic control , have not yet been fully as ##cer ##tained . here , we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 epidemic recently . sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 , similar to sar ##s and mer ##s , is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high in ##fect ##ivity . it is commonly recognized that drop ##let transmission is the main route . spread by aero ##sol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but une ##sta ##bl ##ished now . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological experts , as well as the who , consider more evidence is needed to confirm . 3 besides , there are other routes except respiratory transmission . the previous study indicated that different human corona ##virus ##es , such as sar ##s ‐ co ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v , can maintain infectious for a different time on ina ##ni ##mate surfaces . 4 meanwhile , it was reported that sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 was also founded on the surface of the door handles , cell phones , and other items in the residential sites of confirmed cases . 5 therefore , individuals will be probably infected if they touch the nose , mouth , or eyes after contact ##ing the contaminated items .  
the present outbreak of a corona ##virus - associated acute respiratory disease called corona ##virus disease 19 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is the third documented spill ##over of an animal corona ##virus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic . the corona ##vir ##idae study group ( cs ##g ) of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family corona ##vir ##idae , has assessed the placement of the human pathogen , tentatively named 2019 - nc ##ov , within the corona ##vir ##idae . based on ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , taxonomy and established practice , the cs ##g recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##vs ) of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus , and designate ##s it as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in order to facilitate communication , the cs ##g proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolate ##s : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / host / location / isolate / date . while the full spectrum of clinical manifestation ##s associated with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections in humans remains to be determined , the independent zoo ##not ##ic transmission of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogen ##ic viruses of immediate significance . this will improve our understanding of virus – host interactions in an ever - changing environment and enhance our prepared ##ness for future outbreak ##s .  
on 31 december 2019 the wu ##han health commission reported a cluster of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of wu ##han , china . the first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid - december 2019 . clinical isolate ##s were found to contain a novel corona ##virus with similarity to bat corona ##virus ##es . as of 28 january 2020 , there are in excess of 4 , 500 laboratory - confirmed cases , with > 100 known deaths . as with the sar ##s - co ##v , infections in children appear to be rare . travel - related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland china including germany , france , thailand , japan , south korea , vietnam , canada , and the united states , as well as hong kong and taiwan . domestically in china , the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one pro ##vine ##nce . while zoo ##not ##ic transmission appears to be the original source of infections , the most alarm ##ing development is that human - to - human transmission is now pre ##vel ##ant . of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic . there are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved , including how efficient is human - to - human transmission ? what is the animal reservoir ? is there an intermediate animal reservoir ? do the vaccines generated to the sar ##s - co ##v or mer ##s - co ##v or their proteins offer protection against 2019 - nc ##ov ? we offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines . we also present data on the use of in si ##lic ##o docking in gaining insight into 2019 - nc ##ov spike - receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development . diagnostic pc ##r protocols can be found at https : / / www . who . int / health - topics / corona ##virus / laboratory - diagnostic ##s - for - novel - corona ##virus .  
a possible threat in the op ##ht ##hal ##mology clinic while the 2019 - nc ##ov transmission route is still unknown , countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with corona ##virus ##es namely sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . these viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secret ##ions . in the op ##ht ##hal ##mology practice , healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections . firstly , op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logists are extremely re ##lian ##t on physical examination during patient consultation . of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logist during the slit lamp microscope examination . it has been shown that droplets from a cough or s ##nee ##ze can be propelled for up to 6 ? m [ 8 ] , a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logist . secondly , during the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic , clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection . in a case series by lo ##on et al . , it was shown that viral rna of the sar ##s - co ##v can be detected by reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) from the tears of infected individuals [ 9 ] . while an ##ec ##dot ##al in nature , such accounts highlight the possible in ##fect ##ivity of tears , a fluid which op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis . if true , this represents a crucial need for further development of di ##sin ##fect ##ion and personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) protocols for the op ##ht ##hal ##mology clinic . s ##n - 147 ##6 - 54 ##54 
corona ##virus ##es have been implicated in nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s with environmental contamination as a route of transmission . similarly , nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has been reported . however , the mode of transmission and extent of environmental contamination are unknown .  
abstract the outbreak of the novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) quickly spread all over china and to more than 20 other countries . although the virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) nuclei ##c acid rt - pc ##r test has become the standard method for diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , these real - time pc ##r test kits have many limitations . in addition , high false negative rates were reported . there is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients . we have developed a rapid and simple point - of - care lateral flow im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y which can detect i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies simultaneously against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages . with this test kit , we carried out clinical studies to valid ##ate its clinical efficacy uses . the clinical detection sensitivity and specific ##ity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 39 ##7 pc ##r confirmed co ##vid - 19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites . the overall testing sensitivity was 88 . 66 % and specific ##ity was 90 . 63 % . in addition , we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of ve ##nous and fingers ##tick blood samples . the results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingers ##tick blood , serum and plasma of ve ##nous blood . the i ##gm - i ##gg combined ass ##ay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single i ##gm or i ##gg test . it can be used for the rapid screening of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 carriers , sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , in hospitals , clinics , and test laboratories . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
abstract to investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in china , a total of 70 genome ##s of virus strains from china and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 december 2019 and 3 february 2020 were analyzed . to explore the potential intermediate animal host of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , we re - analyzed vi ##rom ##e data ##set ##s from pang ##olin ##s and representative sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es isolate ##s from bats , with particular attention paid to the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein gene . we performed phylogenetic , split network , transmission network , likelihood - mapping , and comparative analyses of the genome ##s . based on bay ##esian time - scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip - dating method , we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor ( t ##m ##rca ) and evolutionary rate of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , which ranged from 22 ? 24 november 2019 and 1 . 19 ? 1 . 31 ? 10 - 3 substitution ##s per site per year , respectively . our results also revealed that the beta ##co ##v / bat / yunnan / rat ##g ##13 / 2013 virus was more similar to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus than the corona ##virus obtained from the two pang ##olin samples ( sr ##r ##10 ##16 ##8 ##37 ##7 and sr ##r ##10 ##16 ##8 ##37 ##8 ) . we also identified a unique peptide ( pr ##ra ) insertion in the human sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , which may be involved in the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular pro ##tea ##ses , and thus could impact host range and trans ##mis ##sibility . interesting ##ly , the corona ##virus carried by pang ##olin ##s did not have the rr ##ar motif . therefore , we concluded that the human sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus , which is responsible for the recent outbreak of co ##vid - 19 , did not come directly from pang ##olin ##s . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
abstract recently , a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in wu ##han , china . genetically , it is closely related to the sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . the situation is getting worse and worse , therefore , there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we characterized spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to obtain im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes . next , we chose 13 major his ##to ##com ##pati ##bility complex - ( m ##hc ) i and 3 m ##hc - ii ep ##ito ##pes , having antigen ##ic properties . these ep ##ito ##pes are usually linked to specific link ##ers to build vaccine components and molecular ##ly dock on toll - like receptor ( t ##lr ) - 5 to get binding affinity . therefore , in order to provide a fast im ##mun ##ogenic profile of these ep ##ito ##pes we performed im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics analysis so that rapid development of vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
abstract when an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown et ##iology occurred in wu ##han city , hub ##ei province , china in december of 2019 , the mystery ##1 was the nature of the ca ##usa ##tive agent . because many of the patients had visited a fish and wild animal market , the possibility of a rec ##ur ##rence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) needed to be investigated ##2 . finally , could this outbreak of pneumonia be caused by a novel corona ##virus that was different from those causing sar ##s or middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) 3 ? this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) occurred in wu ##han and it has rapidly spread to almost all parts of the world . for corona ##virus ##es , rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) is an important pro ##tea ##se that cat ##aly ##ze the replication of rna from rna template and is an attractive therapeutic target . in this study , we screened these chemical structures from traditional chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti - viral activity in sar ##s - co ##v and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target rd ##rp of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . we found that the ##af ##lav ##in has a lower id ##ock score in the catalytic pocket of rd ##rp in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( - 9 . 11 kc ##al / mo ##l ) , sar ##s - co ##v ( - 8 . 03 kc ##al / mo ##l ) and mer ##s - co ##v ( - 8 . 26 kc ##al / mo ##l ) from id ##ock . to confirm the result , we discovered that the ##af ##lav ##in has a lower binding energy of - 8 . 8 kc ##al / mo ##l when it docks in the catalytic pocket of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp by using the blind docking server . regarding contact modes , hydro ##phobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between the ##af ##lav ##in and rd ##rp . moreover , one π - cat ##ion interaction was formed between the ##af ##lav ##in and ar ##g ##55 ##3 from the blind docking server . our results suggest that the ##af ##lav ##in could be potential sar ##s - co ##v - 2 rd ##rp inhibitor for further study . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
starting around december 2019 , an epidemic of pneumonia , which was named co ##vid - 19 by world health organization ( who ) , broke out in wu ##han , china , and is spreading throughout the world . a new corona ##virus , named sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by the corona ##virus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ( ict ##v ) was soon found to be the cause . at present , the sensitivity of clinical nuclei ##c acid detection is limited , and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation . in this study , we retrieved 95 full - length gen ##omic sequences of sara ##s - co ##v - 2 strains from the nc ##bi and gi ##sai ##d databases , established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses , and analyzed sequence variations along the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome . the homo ##logy among all viral strains was generally high , among them 99 . 99 % ( 99 . 91 % - 100 % ) at the nu ##cle ##otide level , 99 . 99 % ( 99 . 79 % - 100 % ) at the amino acid level . although overall variation in or ##f regions is low , 13 variation sites in 1a , 1b , s , 3a , m , 8 , and n regions were identified , among which positions nt ##28 ##14 ##4 in or ##f 8 and nt ##8 ##7 ##8 ##2 in or ##f 1a showed mutation rate of 30 . 53 % ( 29 / 95 ) and 29 . 47 % ( 28 / 95 ) respectively . these findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing prime ##rs and probe ##s . establishment of the reference sequence for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis , clinical monitoring and intervention of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in the future . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved .  
abstract : the recently emerged 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) and associated co ##vid - 19 disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no approved therapeutic ##s or effective treatment is currently available to effectively combat the outbreak . this urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutic ##s for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . along these efforts , the structure of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) has been rapidly resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global efforts to develop novel drug candidates . recently , our group has developed a novel deep learning platform ? deep docking ( dd ) which provides fast prediction of docking scores of glide ( or any other docking program ) and , hence , enables structure - based virtual screening of billions of pu ##rch ##asa ##ble molecules in a short time . in the current study we applied dd to all 1 . 3 billion compounds from zinc ##15 library to identify top 1 , 000 potential ligand ##s for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 mp ##ro protein . the compounds are made publicly available for further characterization and development by scientific community .  
up to 09 : 40 february 17 , 2020 , there have been 70 , 640 confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( aka 2019 - nc ##ov ) cases in china . sichuan provincial people ’ s hospital acts as an organ transplant center in west of china , approximately 200 solid organ transplant ##s performed each year and can perform heart , lung , liver , kidney , small bow ##el , stem cell transplant ##ation , so it is necessary to establish a hospital - specific protocol to deal with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection for the donor and recipient .  
the pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , also called 2019 - nc ##ov ) recently break out in wu ##han , china , and was named as co ##vid - 19 . with the spread of the disease , similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of china . we aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in guangzhou , china .  
since 2012 and to date , outbreak / new cases of middle east respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) were always reported in saudi arabia . al - jo ##uf region is considered as one of the most vulnerable areas to the disease outbreak . this research aimed to assess ( to the best of our knowledge ) , for the first time , the current level of awareness towards mer ##s - co ##v among the al - jo ##uf region population through a well - designed multi ##sta ##ge question ##naire .  
based on the announcement of the world health organization ( who ) in 2018 , the wu ##han pneumonia caused by an unknown et ##iology should be recognized as the first disease x . later , the pathogen was identified to be a novel corona ##virus denoted 2019 - nc ##ov , which has 79 . 5 % and 96 % whole genome sequence identify to sar ##s - co ##v and bat sar ##s - related corona ##virus ( sar ##sr - co ##v - rat ##g ##13 ) , respectively , suggesting its potential bat origin . with high human - to - human transmission rate ( r ##0 ) , 2019 - nc ##ov has quickly spread in china and other countries , resulting in 34 , 95 ##3 confirmed cases and 72 ##5 deaths as of 8 february 2020 , thus calling for urgent development of therapeutic ##s and prop ##hyl ##actic ##s . here we suggest renaming 2019 - nc ##ov as “ trans ##missible acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( tar ##s - co ##v ) ” and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutral ##izing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the he ##pta ##d repeat 1 ( hr ##1 ) domain in spike protein of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
the emergence of 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is of global concern and might have emerged from rna rec ##om ##bina ##tion among existing corona ##virus ##es . co ##v spike ( s ) protein which is crucial for receptor binding , membrane fusion via conform ##ation ##al changes , internal ##ization of the virus , host tissue tr ##op ##ism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development , remain largely un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized . therefore , the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation , structural and antigen ##ic diver ##gence of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein which may be helpful for the management of 2019 - nc ##ov infection . the sequences of spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were used for the comparison . the sequence variations were determined using em ##bos ##s needle pair ##wise sequence alignment tools . the variation in g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites was predicted by net ##ng ##ly ##c 1 . 0 and valid ##ated by n - g ##ly ##de server . antigen ##ici ##ty was predicted by net ##ct ##l 1 . 2 and valid ##ated by ie ##db analysis resource server . the structural diver ##gence was determined by using super ##pose version 1 . 0 based on cry ##o - em structure of the sar ##s corona ##virus spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . our data suggests that 2019 - nc ##ov is newly spilled corona ##virus into humans in china is closely related to sar ##s - co ##v , which has only 12 . 8 % of difference with sar ##s - co ##v in s protein and has 83 . 9 % similarity in minimal receptor - binding domain with sar ##s - co ##v . addition of a novel g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites were observed in 2019 - nc ##ov . in addition , antigen ##ic analysis proposes that great antigen ##ic differences exist between both the viral strains , but some of the ep ##ito ##pes were found to be similar between both the s proteins . in spite of the variation in s protein amino acid composition , we found no significant difference in their structures . collectively , for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019 - nc ##ov is closely related to predecessor sar ##s - co ##v and provide the evidence that 2019 - nc ##ov uses various novel g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion sites as sar ##s - co ##v and may have a potential to become pan ##de ##mic owing its antigen ##ic disc ##re ##pan ##cy . further , demonstration of novel cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ep ##ito ##pes may imp ##art opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
early batch ##es of a kit developed by the us government to dia ##gno ##se the novel corona ##virus infection have been plagued by problems that initially limited their use and cast doubt on their accuracy . the problems were first reported by the washington post , and c & en learned soon after that the kits contained faulty re ##age ##nts that led to inc ##on ##clusive read ##outs . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has started an investigation into what exactly went wrong with the tests . the cdc designed and manufactured the test kit , which detect ##s the rna genome of the virus , called severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the us food and drug administration has approved its use in public health departments nationwide . as of march 5 , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has killed 10 people in the us and infected nearly 100 . several hundred people have been tested , but the cdc has now stopped reporting testing numbers in favor of [ truncated ] 
international teams worked at speed to make tests for the virus available in record time . the medical community is rally ##ing to develop a set of rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic tests for the new human corona ##virus that appeared in china — now dubbed sudden acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) .  
how did researchers react so quickly to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic ? nature medicine has asked some key experts .  
a new corona ##virus , referred to as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , is responsible for the recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease . this outbreak first detected in wu ##han , china in december 2019 , has spread to other regions of china and to 25 other countries as of january , 2020 . it has been known since the 2003 sar ##s epidemic that the receptor critical for sar ##s - co ##v entry into host cells is the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the s ##1 domain of the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v attache ##s the virus to its cellular receptor ace ##2 on the host cells . we thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , ace ##2 and the rational ##e for soluble ace ##2 as a potential therapy .  
for the third time in less than 20 years there is global concern about a novel corona ##virus causing significant respiratory mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) were reported by china to the world health organization ( who ) in 2003 ; one - third of these were among healthcare workers ( who , 2003 ) . by the end of the outbreak in 2004 , more than half ( 37 ##8 ; 57 % ) of the 66 ##7 sar ##s cases treated in asian and canadian outbreak hospitals were healthcare workers or medical students ( sep ##kow ##itz and e ##isen ##berg , 2005 ) . at the time of and for many years after the sar ##s outbreak , there was much con ##ster ##nation among the medical and infectious disease communities about the organism ' s mode ( s ) of transmission . aero ##sol ##s ( both fine particles and larger droplets ) had to be at least partially responsible for the relative ease with which sar ##s was transmitted from person to person . as more detailed ep ##i - demi ##olo ##gic data were published , this proved to be the case - risk factors for nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of sar ##s included exposure during aero ##sol - generating medical procedures , failure to isolate infectious patients , and the lack or uneven use of personal protective equipment ( scales et al . , 2003 ; fowler et al . , 2004 ; of ##ner - ago ##sti ##ni et al . , 2006 ; chen et al . , 2009 ) . in may 2014 , when the first cases of middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) were reported in the usa 2 years after initial outbreak ##s in saudi arabia , dr ra ##cha ##el jones and i published a commentary on the center for infectious disease research and practice website ( bros ##sea ##u and jones , 2014 ) . we argued that mer ##s was likely an aero ##sol - trans ##missible disease , because it resulted in symptoms similar to sar ##s ( cough , dia ##rr ##hea , and vomiting ) and patients would likely undergo aero ##sol - generating procedures , such as int ##ub - at ##ion and bro ##nch ##os ##co ##py . as with sar ##s , early data suggested aero ##sol transmission of mer ##s among hospital patients located at some distance from each other . as with sar ##s , the mer ##s corona ##virus remains viable as an aero ##sol and on surfaces for long periods of time at low relative humidity . we argued that healthcare workers should be provided with fit - tested n ##9 ##5 filtering face ##piece res ##pi ##rator ##s ( ff ##rs ) , at a minimum , when caring for mer ##s patients . for exposure ##s to high concentrations of infectious particles , such as from patients
the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the pathogen of 2019 novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , has posed a serious threat to global public health . the who has declared the outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection an international public health emergency . lung lesions have been considered as the major damage caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . however , liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases . similarly , previous studies have shown that liver damage was common in the patients infected by the other two highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus - severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and associated with the severity of diseases . in this review , the characteristics and mechanism of liver injury caused by sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , as well as sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection were summarized , which may provide help for further studies on the liver injury of co ##vid - 19 .  
just weeks after a novel corona ##virus emerged in wu ##han , china , the outbreak continued to expand in gravity and scope . this week , the cumulative death toll surpassed 1000 , compared with the more than 800 killed by another corona ##virus in the 2002 – 03 outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . authorities assigned official names to the virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and the resulting disease , co ##vid - 19 . li wen ##lian ##g , a 34 - year - old doctor who sounded an early alarm in wu ##han about the disease only to be summoned by local police for doing so , succumbed to the virus last week .  
the seeming precision of the global tall ##ies of cases and deaths caused by the novel corona ##virus now spreading from wu ##han , china bel ##ies an alarm ##ing fact . . . . ( a study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses christ ##ened the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 , or sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the same day ) . but many news stories have reported shortages of diagnostic ##s in hub ##ei .  
background as the number of patients increases , there is a growing understanding of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which has caused an outbreak in china . up to now , clinical features and treatment of patients infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 have been reported in detail . however , the relationship between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and coa ##gul ##ation has been scarcely addressed . our aim is to investigate the blood coa ##gul ##ation function of patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . methods in our study , 94 patients with confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection were admitted in ren ##min hospital of wu ##han university . we prospective ##ly collect blood coa ##gul ##ation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period . results anti ##th ##rom ##bin values in patients were lower than that in the control group ( p < 0 . 001 ) . the values of d - dime ##r , fi ##bri ##n / fi ##bri ##no ##gen degradation products ( f ##dp ) , and fi ##bri ##no ##gen ( fi ##b ) in all sar ##s - co ##v - 2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls . moreover , d - dime ##r and f ##dp values in patients with severe sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection were higher than those in patients with mild ##er forms . compared with healthy controls , pro ##th ##rom ##bin time activity ( pt - act ) was lower in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients . th ##rom ##bin time in critical sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients was also shorter than that in controls . conclusions the coa ##gul ##ation function in patients with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is significantly der ##ange ##d compared with healthy people , but monitoring d - dime ##r and f ##dp values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases .  
it : two corona ##virus ##es , hc ##ov - 229 ##e and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans , were described in the xx c . pan ##de ##mic corona ##virus ##es were first discovered as late as in the xx ##i c . : sar ##s - hc ##ov in 2002 – causing severe respiratory tract infections ( sar ##s ) in china ; mer ##s - hc ##ov in 2012 – circulating mostly on the arabian peninsula . the sar ##s epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in mor ##bid ##ity of > 800 ##0 and > 770 deaths , while the mer ##s epidemic is still ongoing ( > 2000 ill , > 700 deaths ) although its intensity decreased . both viruses are zoo ##not ##ic and require at least two “ host jumps ” for the transmission of the infection to humans : for hc ##ov - sar ##s – from bat to palm ci ##vet and then to human ; for hc ##ov - mer ##s – from bats to camel ##s and subsequently to humans . primary mode of transmission is drop ##let in close contact ( < 1 m ) , but both viruses remain active in aero ##sol ( up to 24 h ) , so infection can be also spread by air ( ventilation ) . the ability for human - to - human transmission is higher for hc ##ov - sar ##s than for hc ##ov - mer ##s ( 8 generations vs . 4 , respectively ) . moreover , there are differences in genome structure and pathogen ##ic mechanisms : different receptor , cell entry mechanism , different way of host response modulation ( e . g . inhibition of if ##n ##β cascade ) , etc . probably , these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans . infection caused by hc ##ov - mer ##s might manifest itself as ar ##ds , a mild - manner ##ed and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic disease . hc ##ov - sar ##s infections seem to be associated with severe disease only . in this paper , a comparison of the structure of these viruses , the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the inter ##sp ##ec ##ies barrier and to multi ##ply in the human body , including modulation of if ##n ##β cascade , as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused , were presented .

the ability of corona ##virus ##es to in ##fect humans is invariably associated with their binding strengths to human receptor proteins . both sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , initially named 2019 - nc ##ov , and sar ##s - co ##v were reported to utilize ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as an entry receptor in human cells . to better understand the inter ##play between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and ace ##2 , we performed computational alan ##ine scanning mu ##tage ##nes ##is on the “ hot ##sp ##ot ” residues at protein - protein interfaces using relative free energy calculations . our data suggest that the mutations in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 lead to a greater binding affinity relative to sar ##s - co ##v . in addition , our free energy calculations provide insight into the infectious ability of viruses on a physical basis , and also provide useful information for the design of anti ##vira ##l drugs .  
the rapid outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in china followed by its spread around the world poses a serious global concern for public health with almost 900 ##00 people infected and thousands of fatalities . to conquer viral infections , the inhibition of pro ##tea ##ses essential for pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of viral poly ##pro ##tein ##s is a conventional therapeutic strategy . to this date , no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat sar ##s - co ##v - 2 despite its close relation to the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003 . thus , there remains an urgent need for the development of specific anti ##vira ##l therapeutic ##s to conquer sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in order to find novel inhibitors , we computational ##ly screened a compound library of over 68 ##7 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main pro ##tea ##se of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . a screening of such a vast chemical space for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors has not been reported before . after shape screening , two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic ##ally relevant molecular des ##cript ##ors to narrow down the initial hits . next , molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to valid ##ate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensive ##ly quan ##tify ligand binding energies . after evaluation of off - target binding , we report a list of 11 drug - like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target pro ##tea ##se in contrast to the co ##cr ##yst ##all ##ized pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic lead compound that suffers from poor ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic properties . furthermore , we identified one potent bind ##er with comparable properties from the natural compound library .  
a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was identified from respiratory illness patients in wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china , which has recently emerged as a serious threat to the world public health . howe ##r , no approved drugs have been found to effectively inhibit the virus . since it has been reported that the hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors can be used as anti - sar ##s drugs by te ##gart ##ing sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro , we choose six approved anti - hiv - 1 drugs to investigate their binding interactions between 3 ##cl ##pro , and to evaluate their potential to become clinical drugs for the new corona ##virus pneumonia ( co ##vid ##19 ) caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . the molecular docking results indicate that , the 3 ##cl ##pro of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has a higher binding affinity for all the studied inhibitors than its sar ##s homo ##logue . two docking complexes ( ind ##ina ##vir and dar ##una ##vir ) with high docking scores were fu ##ther subjected to mm - pbs ##a binding free energy calculations to detail the molecular interactions between these two protein ##ase inhibitors and the 3 ##cl ##pro . our results show that dar ##una ##vir has the best binding affinity with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro among all inhibitors , indicating it has the potential to become an anti - co ##vid - 19 clinical drug . the likely reason behind the increased binding affinity of hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitors toward sar ##s - co ##v ##2 3 ##cl ##pro than that of sar ##s - co ##v were investigated by md simulations . our study provides insight into the possible role of structural flexibility during interactions between 3 ##cl ##pro and inhibitors , and sheds light on the structure - based design of anti - co ##vid - 19 drugs targeting the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 3 ##cl ##pro .  
a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) first detected in wu ##han , china , has spread rapidly since december 2019 , causing more than 100 , 000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities ( as of 10 march 2020 ) . the outbreak has been declared a pan ##de ##mic by the who on mar 11 , 2020 . here , we explore how seasonal variation in trans ##mis ##sibility could mod ##ulate a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic . data from routine diagnostic ##s show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic corona ##virus ##es ( 229 ##e , hk ##u ##1 , nl ##6 ##3 , o ##c ##43 ) and we parameter ##ise our model for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using these data . the model allows for many sub ##pop ##ulation ##s of different size with variable parameters . simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020 / 2021 . variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions . while the uncertainty in parameters is large , the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained . seasonal forcing on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission . the likely aggregate ##d effect of seasonal variation , infection control measures , and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pan ##de ##mic wave with lower prevalence at any given time , thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus emerged in december 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide , particularly to china , japan , and south korea . scientists are endeavor ##ing to find anti ##vira ##ls specific to the virus . several drugs such as ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , ar ##bid ##ol , re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , and fa ##vi ##pi ##ra ##vir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) in china ; some promising results have been achieved thus far . this article sum ##mar ##izes agents with potential efficacy against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a significant emerging infectious disease . humans infected with the et ##iol ##ogical agent , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , primarily present with p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis but may also develop he ##pati ##c , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal , and renal pathology . we in ##oc ##ulated common mar ##mos ##ets ( call ##ith ##rix ja ##cc ##hus ) with the objective of developing a small non ##hum ##an primate model of sar ##s . two groups of c . ja ##cc ##hus were in ##oc ##ulated intra ##tra ##che ##ally with cell culture super ##nat ##ant containing sar ##s - co ##v . in a time course pathogen ##esis study , animals were evaluated at 2 , 4 , and 7 days after infection for morphological changes and evidence of viral replication . all animals developed a multi ##fo ##cal mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cell inter ##sti ##tial p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis , accompanied by multi ##nu ##cle ##ated sync ##yt ##ial cells , ed ##ema , and bro ##nch ##iol ##itis in most animals . viral antigen localized primarily to infected al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges and type - 1 p ##ne ##um ##ocytes by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry . viral rna was detected in all animals from pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at nec ##rop ##sy . viral rna was also detected in tr ##ache ##ob ##ron ##chia ##l l ##ym ##ph node and my ##oca ##rdi ##um , together with inflammatory changes , in some animals . he ##pati ##c inflammation was observed in most animals , predominantly as a multi ##fo ##cal l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##ytic hepatitis accompanied by nec ##rosis of individual he ##pa ##to ##cytes . these findings identify the common mar ##mos ##et as a promising non ##hum ##an primate to study sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) first appeared in guangdong province , china , in november 2002 . although virus isolation and ser ##ology were useful early in the sar ##s outbreak for dia ##gno ##sing new cases , these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a bs ##l - 3 laboratory and ser ##oco ##n ##version is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection . the first qu ##ali ##tative reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction tests for sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalent ##s . these ass ##ays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real - time ass ##ays that helped el ##uc ##ida ##te the natural history of sar ##s , particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract . the unique natural history of sar ##s - co ##v infection di ##cta ##tes the testing of both respiratory and non ##res ##pi ##rator ##y specimens , the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient , and sending out positive ##s to be confirmed by a reference laboratory . commercially available reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction tests for sar ##s have recently appeared ; however , meaningful evaluation ##s of these ass ##ays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined . these and other issues related to diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v infection are discussed in this review .  
objective : in order to investigate the clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological rules of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , rates and levels sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) i ##gg antibodies of the patients and community populations from several areas were detected . methods : indirect im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent ass ##ay ( if ##a ) and double - antigen sandwich enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) were used to detect the sar ##s corona ##virus - specific i ##gg antibodies in sera of 1700 , including 145 ##3 general populations from hong ##kong , marco , guangzhou and peking and 257 sar ##s patients from guangzhou and peking . the dynamics of the serum antibodies of sar ##s patients were observed from 3 to 360 days after onset of symptoms . results : 90 % of 257 patient serum specimens after 20 days of disease onset showed positive sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg either using elisa or if ##a . 257 sar ##s patients , antibodies ti ##ters increased steadily in early 4 to 6 months after onset of sar ##s . the ti ##ters of most cases came to the peak in the 6th month . then antibodies ti ##ters declined rapidly in some cases . however , all specimens still were positive for sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg in the 48th month . conclusions : this study suggest that few ina ##ppa ##rent infectious patients exist during sar ##s epidemic . serum i ##gg antibodies has diagnostic value for sar ##s in the late course of disease and the antibodies present more than 48 months .  
development of anti - severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) agents is pivotal to prevent the re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of the life - threatening disease , sar ##s . in this study , more than 200 extracts from chinese medicinal herbs were evaluated for anti - sar ##s - co ##v activities using a cell - based ass ##ay that measured sar ##s - co ##v - induced cy ##top ##ath ##ogenic effect ( cp ##e ) in vitro on ve ##ro e ##6 cells . six herbal extracts , one each from gen ##tian ##ae ra ##di ##x ( 龍 [UNK] long dan ; the dried r ##hi ##zo ##me of gen ##tian ##a sc ##ab ##ra ) , di ##os ##core ##ae r ##hi ##zo ##ma ( 山 [UNK] shan yao ; the tube ##r of di ##os ##core ##a bat ##ata ##s ) , cass ##iae se ##men ( [UNK] 明 子 ju ##e ming z ##i ; the dried seed of cass ##ia tor ##a ) and lo ##rant ##hi ram ##us ( [UNK] [UNK] 生 sang ji sheng ; the dried stem , with leaf of taxi ##llus chin ##ensis ) ( designated as gs ##h , db ##m , ct ##h and tc ##h , respectively ) , and two from r ##hi ##zo ##ma ci ##bot ##ii ( [UNK] [UNK] go ##u ji ; the dried r ##hi ##zo ##me of ci ##bot ##ium bar ##ome ##tz ) ( designated as cbe and cb ##m ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v at concentrations between 25 and 200 μ ##g / ml . the concentrations of the six extracts needed to inhibit 50 % of ve ##ro e ##6 cell proliferation ( cc ( 50 ) ) and 50 % of viral replication ( ec ( 50 ) ) were determined . the resulting selective index values ( si = cc ( 50 ) / ec ( 50 ) ) of the most effective extracts cbe , gs ##h , db ##m , ct ##h and tc ##h were > 59 . 4 , > 57 . 5 , > 62 . 1 , > 59 . 4 , and > 92 . 9 , respectively . among these extracts , cb ##m and db ##m also showed significant inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se activity with ic ( 50 ) values of 39 μ ##g / ml and 44 μ ##g / ml , respectively . our findings suggest that these six herbal extracts may have potential as candidates for future development of anti - sar ##s therapeutic ##s . abbreviation ##s sar ##s , severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v , corona ##virus cp ##e , cy ##top ##ath ##ogenic effect tc ##m , traditional chinese medicine 
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance , has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people , resulting in almost 600 deaths . the high case fatal ##ity rate , growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of this novel pathogen have created an urgent need for effective public health counter ##me ##as ##ures , including safe and effective treatment strategies . despite the relatively few numbers of cases to date , research and development of mer ##s - co ##v therapeutic candidates is advancing quickly . this review surveys the landscape of these efforts and assess ##es their potential for use in affected populations .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , has caused rec ##urrent outbreak ##s worldwide . it is associated with severe mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , and is not treat ##able with the currently available anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies . we present a case of a 43 year - old male healthcare provider , who admitted with productive cough , d ##ys ##p ##nea , my ##al ##gia , pl ##eur ##itic chest pain and fever . computed tom ##ography ( ct ) showed bilateral ground glass op ##ac ##ities and consolidation . sp ##ut ##um polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) for mer ##s - corona ##virus was positive .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified in 2012 during the first middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) outbreak ##s . mer ##s - co ##v causes an acute lower - respiratory infection in humans , with a fatal ##ity rate of ~ 35 . 5 % . currently , there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against mer ##s in the world . the mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein plays the most important role in the viral life cycle ( virus internal ##ization ) . the s protein is an im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant antigen and the main target for neutral ##izing antibodies . in the present study , the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ities of five different forms of the mer ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein were compared : the full - length s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , the full - length s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein with the trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain of the g g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of vs ##v ( s - g ) , the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , the membrane - fused rb ##d ( the rb ##d fused with the trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain of the vs ##v g g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( rb ##d - g ) ) , and the rb ##d fused with fc of human i ##gg ##1 ( rb ##d - fc ) . rec ##om ##bina ##nt vectors based on human aden ##ov ##irus ##es type 5 ( ra ##d ##5 ) were used as delivery vehicles . va ##cci ##nation with all of the developed ra ##d ##5 vectors eli ##cite ##d a balanced th ##1 / th ##2 response in mice . the most robust humor ##al immune response was induced after the animal had been va ##cci ##nated with the membrane - fused rb ##d ( ra ##d ##5 - rb ##d - g ) . only im ##mun ##ization with membrane forms of the g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( ra ##d ##5 - s , ra ##d ##5 - s - g , and ra ##d ##5 - rb ##d - g ) eli ##cite ##d neutral ##izing antibodies among all va ##cci ##nated animals . the most significant cellular immune response was induced after va ##cci ##nation of the animals with the full - length s ( ra ##d ##5 - s ) . these investigations suggest that the full - length s and the membrane form of the rb ##d ( rb ##d - g ) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein .  
purpose : the large number of deaths in a short period of time due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) infection led to the un ##para ##lle ##led collaborative efforts world wide to determine and character ##ize the new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the canadian group with international collaboration . as per the world health organization ( who ) , the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of sar ##s makes this area a priority for future research . to prevent deaths in the future , early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance . methods : this review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostic ##s and therapeutic ##s of viral infection . results : the three major diagnostic methods available for sar ##s includes viral rna detection by reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , virus induced antibodies by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) or by enzyme linked im ##mun ##oso ##rba ##nt ass ##ay ( elisa ) of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) . the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of sar ##s - co ##v is the major induce ##r of neutral ##izing antibodies . the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s ##1 region of the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein contains multiple conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes that induce ##s highly potent neutral ##izing antibodies . the genetically engineered at ##ten ##uated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein has been shown to eli ##cit protective immunity in va ##cci ##nated animals . conclusion : np is the preferred target for routine detection of sar ##s - co ##v infection by elisa which is an economical method compared to other methods . the rb ##d of the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutral ##izing deter ##mina ##nt of sar ##s - co ##v . the progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the availability of clinical ##ly relevant animal model .  
we have previously reported that a subunit protein vaccine based on the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein and a rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##o - associated virus ( ra ##av ) - based rb ##d ( rb ##d - ra ##av ) vaccine could induce highly potent neutral ##izing ab responses in im ##mun ##ized animals . in this study , systemic , mu ##cos ##al , and cellular immune responses and long - term protective immunity induced by rb ##d - ra ##av were further characterized in a bal ##b / c mouse model , with comparison of the i . m . and intra ##nas ##al ( i . n . ) routes of administration . our results demonstrated that : 1 ) the i . n . va ##cci ##nation induced a systemic humor ##al immune response of comparable strength and shorter duration than the i . m . va ##cci ##nation , but the local humor ##al immune response was much stronger ; 2 ) the i . n . va ##cci ##nation eli ##cite ##d stronger systemic and local specific cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t cell responses than the i . m . va ##cci ##nation , as evidenced by higher prevalence of il - 2 and / or if ##n - γ - producing cd ##3 ( + ) / cd ##8 ( + ) t cells in both lungs and sp ##leen ; 3 ) the i . n . va ##cci ##nation induced similar protection as the i . m . va ##cci ##nation against sar ##s - co ##v challenge in mice ; 4 ) higher ti ##ters of mu ##cos ##al i ##ga and serum - neutral ##izing ab were associated with lower viral load and less pulmonary path ##ological damage , while no ab - mediated disease enhancement effect was observed ; and 5 ) the va ##cci ##nation could provide long - term protection against sar ##s - co ##v infection . taken together , our findings suggest that rb ##d - ra ##av can be further developed into a vaccine candidate for prevention of sar ##s and that i . n . va ##cci ##nation may be the preferred route of administration due to its ability to induce sar ##s - co ##v - specific systemic and mu ##cos ##al immune responses and its better safety profile .  
two critical steps when investigating an animal model of a virus infection are consistently successfully in ##fect ##ing animals and accurately determining viral ti ##ters in tissue throughout the course of infection . here we discuss in detail how to in ##fect mice with sar ##s - co ##v and then quan ##tify the ti ##ter of virus in the lung .  
background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused the first epidemic of the 21st century and continues to threaten the global community . objective : to assess the incidence of coin ##fect ##ion in patients confirmed to have sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection , and thus , to determine the risk of ruling out sar ##s by ruling in another diagnosis . methods : the present report is a retrospective study evaluating the incidence and impact of laboratory - confirmed sar ##s - co ##v and other pulmonary pathogen ##s in 117 patients . these patients were evaluated in a toronto , ontario , community hospital identified as the epic ##ent ##re for the second sar ##s outbreak . results : coin ##fect ##ion with other pulmonary pathogen ##s occur ##ed in patients with sar ##s . seventy - three per cent of the patient population evaluated had laboratory - confirmed sar ##s - co ##v infection . ser ##ology showing acute or recent ch ##lam ##yd ##op ##hila pneumonia ##e or my ##co ##pl ##as ##ma pneumonia ##e infection revealed an incidence of 30 % and 9 % , respectively , in those with sar ##s . these rates are similar to previously published studies on coin ##fect ##ion in pneumonia . all nuclei ##c acid diagnostic ass ##ays were negative for c pneumonia ##e and m pneumonia ##e in respiratory samples from patients with sar ##s having ser ##ological evidence for these at ##yp ##ical pathogen ##s . conclusions : diagnostic ass ##ays for well - recognized pulmonary pathogen ##s have limitations , and ruling out sar ##s - co ##v by ruling in another pulmonary pathogen carries significant risk . despite positive ser ##ology for at ##yp ##ical pathogen ##s , in a setting where clinical suspicion for sar ##s is high , specific tests for sar ##s should be performed to confirm or exclude a diagnosis .  
effective vaccines should con ##fer long - term protection against future outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by a novel zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) with unknown animal reservoirs . we conducted a co ##hort study examining multiple parameters of immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v infection , aiming to identify the immune co ##rre ##lates of protection . we used a matrix of overlapping peptide ##s spanning whole sar ##s - co ##v pro ##te ##ome to determine t cell responses from 128 sar ##s con ##vale ##scent samples by ex vivo if ##n - γ eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ays . approximately 50 % of con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients were positive for t cell responses , and 90 % possessed strongly neutral ##izing abs . fifty - five novel t cell ep ##ito ##pes were identified , with spike protein dominating total t cell responses . cd ##8 ( + ) t cell responses were more frequent and of a greater magnitude than cd ##4 ( + ) t cell responses ( p < 0 . 001 ) . poly ##ch ##romatic cy ##tom ##et ##ry analysis indicated that the virus - specific t cells from the severe group tended to be a central memory ph ##eno ##type ( cd ##27 ( + ) / cd ##45 ##ro ( + ) ) with a significantly higher frequency of poly ##fu ##nction ##al cd ##4 ( + ) t cells producing if ##n - γ , tn ##f - α , and il - 2 , and cd ##8 ( + ) t cells producing if ##n - γ , tn ##f - α , and cd ##10 ##7 ##a ( de ##gra ##nu ##lation ) , as compared with the mild - moderate group . strong t cell responses correlated significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) with higher neutral ##izing ab . the serum cy ##tok ##ine profile during acute infection indicated a significant elevation of innate immune responses . increased th ##2 cy ##tok ##ines were observed in patients with fatal infection . our study provides a road ##ma ##p for the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v and types of immune responses that may be responsible for the virus clearance , and should serve as a bench ##mark for sar ##s - co ##v vaccine design and evaluation .  
the 2003 pan ##de ##mic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) profile ##d the ability of modern diagnostic micro ##biology and molecular biology to identify , isolate and character ##ize , within weeks , a previously unknown viral infectious pathogen . the cu ##lp ##rit , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was detected in patient specimens by traditional cell culture using an unusual cell line for respiratory viruses , ve ##ro e ##6 , and by reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) targeting the polymer ##ase 1 b region of the genome . in addition , ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays were rapidly developed , and the genome of this large virus was sequence ##d within one month of its spread to north america . at the present time , diagnostic ##s have progressed to the point that rt - pc ##r has a sensitivity approaching 80 % within the first few days of onset of illness , while ser ##ology has a sensitivity close to 100 % on con ##vale ##scent sera taken > 21 days after illness onset . viral culture remains a method confined to bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level iii laboratories . the specific ##ity of rt - pc ##r and ser ##ology remains to be con ##clusive ##ly defined , but in most studies to date seems to be > 90 % . ser ##olo ##gic cross - react ##ivity with human corona ##virus ##es causing the common cold may be a problem with some ser ##olo ##gic ass ##ays . the early development of sar ##s - co ##v diagnostic ##s is now being replaced by ref ##ine ##ment and optimization of these ass ##ays . although at the present time we do not have a test that will definitive ##ly rule in or rule out sar ##s at the time of initial presentation of a patient with a respiratory infection , modifications of existing ass ##ays will hopefully result in our ability to make this diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy in the future .  
pseudo ##par ##tic ##le virus neutral ##ization ( pp ##nt ) and a conventional micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ( mn ) ass ##ays are specific for detecting antibodies to mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) when used in ser ##o - ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies in animals . genetically diverse mer ##s - co ##v appear antigen ##ically similar in mn tests . we confirm that mer ##s - co ##v has been circulating in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in saudi arabia in 1993 . preliminary data suggests that feral australian dr ##ome ##dar ##ies may be free of mer ##s - co ##v but larger confirm ##atory studies are needed .  
background : in summer 2003 , a respiratory outbreak was investigated in british columbia , during which nuclei ##c acid tests and ser ##ology unexpectedly indicated react ##ivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . methods : cases at a care facility were ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly characterized and sequential ##ly investigated for conventional agents of respiratory infection , sar ##s - co ##v and other human co ##vs . ser ##ological cross - react ##ivity between sar ##s - co ##v and human co ##v - o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) was investigated by peptide spot ass ##ay . results : ninety - five of 142 residents ( 67 % ) and 53 of 160 staff members ( 33 % ) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection . sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic residents experienced cough ( 66 % ) , fever ( 21 % ) and pneumonia ( 12 % ) . eight residents died , six with pneumonia . no staff members developed pneumonia . findings on reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ays for sar ##s - co ##v at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positive ##s , but this was con ##founded by concurrent identification of antibody to n protein on ser ##ology . subsequent testing by reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction confirmed hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 infection . con ##vale ##scent ser ##ology ruled out sar ##s . notably , sera demonstrated cross - react ##ivity against nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id peptide sequences common to hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and sar ##s - co ##v . conclusions : these findings under ##sco ##re the vi ##ru ##lence of human co ##v - o ##c ##43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross - react ##ivity to antibody against nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting ser ##ological tests for sar ##s - co ##v .  
neutral ##izing antibody responses to the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of enveloped viruses play an important role in immunity . many of these g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s , including the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) protein form trim ##eric units in the membrane of the native vi ##rion . there is substantial experimental and pre - clinical evidence showing that the s protein is a promising lead for vaccines and therapeutic ##s . previously we generated a panel of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) to whole inactivated sar ##s - co ##v which neutral ##ize the virus in vitro . 1 , 2 here , we define their specific ##ity and affinity , map several of their ep ##ito ##pes and lastly character ##ise chi ##meric versions of them . our data show that the neutral ##izing mab ##s bind to the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the sar ##s s protein . three of the chi ##meric mab ##s retain their binding specific ##ity while one conform ##ation ##al mab , f ##26 ##g ##19 , lost its ability to bind the s protein despite high level expression . the affinity for rec ##om ##bina ##nt s is maintained in all of the functional chi ##meric versions of the parental mab ##s . both parental mab f ##26 ##g ##18 and the chi ##meric version neutral ##ize the tor ##2 strain of sar ##s - co ##v with essentially identical ti ##tres ( 2 . 07 and 2 . 47 nm , respectively ) . lastly , a comparison with other neutral ##izing mab ##s to sar ##s - co ##v clearly shows that the dominance of a 33 amino acid residue loop of the sar ##s - co ##v rb ##d is independent of repertoire , species , qu ##ater ##nary structure , and importantly , the technology used to derive the mab ##s . in cases like this , the dominance of a compact rb ##d antigen ##ic domain and the central role of the s protein in pathogen ##esis may inherently create im ##mun ##ose ##le ##ction pressure on viruses to evolve more complex eva ##sion strategies or die out of a host species . the apparent simplicity of the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##ization is in stark contrast to the complexity shown by other enveloped viruses .  
background : an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) began in canada in february 2003 . the initial diagnosis of sar ##s was based on clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological criteria . during the outbreak , molecular and ser ##olo ##gic tests for the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) became available . however , without a “ gold standard , ” it was impossible to determine the useful ##ness of these tests . we describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the sar ##s outbreak in toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if sar ##s returns . methods : we examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in toronto who met the health canada criteria for suspect or probable sar ##s . focusing on tests for sar ##s - co ##v , we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection . results : diagnostic test results for sar ##s - co ##v were available for 110 of the 117 patients . sar ##s - co ##v was detected by means of reverse - transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) in at least one specimen in 59 ( 54 . 1 % ) of 109 patients . ser ##olo ##gic test results of con ##vale ##scent samples were positive in 50 ( 96 . 2 % ) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and con ##vale ##scent phases of the illness . of the 110 patients , 78 ( 70 . 9 % ) had specimens that tested positive by means of rt - pc ##r , ser ##olo ##gic testing or both methods . the proportion of rt - pc ##r test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect sar ##s ( 50 . 8 % , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 38 . 4 % – 63 . 2 % ) and those who met the criteria for probable sar ##s ( 58 . 0 % , 95 % ci 44 . 2 % – 70 . 7 % ) . sar ##s - co ##v was detected in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s in 33 ( 32 . 4 % ) of 102 patients , in stool specimens in 19 ( 63 . 3 % ) of 30 patients , and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 ( 58 . 8 % ) of 17 patients . interpretation : these findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinical ##ly to rule out sar ##s . as tests for sar ##s - co ##v continue to be opt ##imi ##zed , evaluation of the clinical presentation and el ##uc ##ida ##tion of a
the epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has swept through the globe with more than 800 ##0 reported probable cases . in hong kong , the hardest hit areas included our teaching hospital and the am ##oy gardens apartment complex . a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , with a single - stranded plus sense rna genome , was promptly implicated as the ca ##usa ##tive agent and subsequently fulfilled koch ' s post ##ulates . to aid the understanding of sar ##s - co ##v , groups of investigators rapidly sequence ##d viral isolate ##s around the world . we were the third group in the world to release the complete sar ##s - co ##v genome sequence ( isolate cu ##h ##k - w ##1 ) on the world - wide web . with other isolate ##s from patients of distinct ep ##ide ##mi ##ological backgrounds , we additionally sequence ##d four complete ( cu ##h ##k - su ##10 , cu ##h ##k - ag ##01 , cu ##h ##k - ag ##0 ##2 , cu ##h ##k - ag ##0 ##3 ) and two partial sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s . the reviewed data obtained from representative patients from the hospital and community outbreak ##s has documented the evolution of the virus in this epidemic . their sequence variations also revealed a remarkable ep ##ide ##mi ##ological correlation . we demonstrate that sequence variations in the sar ##s - co ##v genome can be applied as a powerful molecular tool in tracing the route of transmission , when used adjunct ##ively with standard ep ##ide ##mi ##ology .  
prior to the global outbreak of sar ##s - co ##v in 2003 , hc ##ov - 229 ##e and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 were the only corona ##virus ##es known to in ##fect humans . following the sar ##s outbreak , 5 additional corona ##virus ##es have been discovered in humans , most recently the novel corona ##virus co ##vid - 19 , believed to have originated in wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china . sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##sco ##v are particularly pathogen ##ic in humans and are associated with high mortality . in this review , the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy , and management of the recently discovered co ##vid - 19 are reviewed , with a focus on best practices and the public health implications .  
according to the world health organization ( who ) , viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health . in the last twenty years , several viral epidemic ##s such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 to 2003 , and h ##1 ##n ##1 influenza in 2009 , have been recorded . most recently , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 . in a timeline that reaches the present day , an epidemic of cases with une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d low respiratory infections detected in wu ##han , the largest metropolitan area in china ' s hub ##ei province , was first reported to the who country office in china , on december 31 , 2019 . published literature can trace the beginning of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals back to the beginning of december 2019 . as they were unable to identify the ca ##usa ##tive agent , these first cases were classified as pneumonia of unknown et ##iology . the chinese center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and local cdc ##s organized an intensive outbreak investigation program . the et ##iology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) family , co ##vid - 19 . on february 11 , 2020 , the who director - general , dr . ted ##ros ad ##han ##om g ##he ##bre ##yes ##us , announced that the disease caused by this new co ##v was a co ##vid - 19 , which is the acronym of corona ##virus disease 2019 . in the past twenty years , two additional corona ##virus epidemic ##s have occurred . sar ##s - co ##v provoked a large - scale epidemic beginning in china and involving two dozen countries with approximately 800 ##0 cases and 800 deaths , and the mer ##s - co ##v that began in saudi arabia and has approximately 2 , 500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases . this new virus seems to be very con ##tag ##ious and has quickly spread globally . in a meeting on january 30 , 2020 , per the international health regulations ( i ##hr , 2005 ) , the outbreak was declared by the who a public health emergency of international concern ( ph ##ei ##c ) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human - to - human transmission . an additional landmark occurred on february 26 , 2020 , as the first case of the disease , not imported from china , was recorded in the united states . initially , the new virus was called 2019 - nc ##ov . subsequently , the task of experts of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ( ict ##v ) termed it the sar ##s - co ##v
2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is a new member of corona ##virus family that can cause serious respiratory diseases after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . at present , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l drug targeting 2019 - nc ##ov . in facing of the increasingly serious epidemic of 2019 novel corona ##virus pneumonia and the urgent needs in drug treatment strategies , this paper reviewed the current research situation and progress in anti ##vira ##l treatment for the newly identified disease .  
2019 - novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is a highly pathogen ##ic human co ##v that first emerged in wu ##han in 2019 . 2019 - nc ##ov has a zoo ##not ##ic origin and poses a major threat to public health . however , little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high vi ##ru ##lence of 2019 - nc ##ov . many animal viruses , including co ##vs , en ##code proteins that interfere with host gene expression , including those involved in anti ##vira ##l immune responses , and these viral proteins are often major vi ##ru ##lence factors . human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) are known respiratory pathogen ##s associated with a range of respiratory infection . in the past 17 years , the onset of 2019 - nc ##ov , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have thrust hc ##ov ##s into spotlight of the research community due to their high pathogen ##ici ##ty in humans . the recent study of hc ##ov ##s - host interactions has contributed extensively to our understanding of infection pathogen ##esis of 2019 - nc ##ov . this review discuss various host ph ##ys ##io ##path ##olo ##gic mechanism , such as ap ##op ##tosis , innate immunity , end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum ( er ) stress response , mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) pathway and nuclear factor kappa b ( n ##f - & kappa ; b ) pathway that may be mod ##ulated by hc ##ov ##s and provides evidence for the intensive investigate of 2019 - nc ##ov infection .  
an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection has spread to children . due to its strong in ##fect ##ivity , people are generally susceptible , including children . the main source of infection is the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection patients , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection may also become the source of infection . bro ##nch ##os ##co ##py is a high - risk operation since during the procedure , with children & prime ' s coughing and an open air ##way , a huge number of droplets and secret ##ions are produced , which will con ##tam ##inate the desktop , equipment and air , and even in ##fect medical staff , other children and care ##gi ##vers in close contact . for this reason , experts were specially organized to write recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric flexible bro ##nch ##os ##co ##py during the epidemic period of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection ( trial version ) , establish indications and prevention and control plans of pediatric bro ##nch ##os ##co ##py during the epidemic period , and provide a basis for medical staff engaged in pediatric bro ##nch ##os ##co ##py .  
introduction in 2012 , mer ##s - co ##v was identified in saudi arabia and resulted in more than 244 ##2 confirmed cases worldwide by may 2019 . mer ##s - co ##v infection in children is less common . a review of mer ##s - co ##v in children from 2012 to april 2016 summarized the clinical manifestation of 31 reported cases . most children were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or had mild respiratory symptoms , and severe infection reported in patients with como ##rb ##id conditions . we aimed to study the clinical characteristics of pediatric mer ##s co ##v infected cases in uae supported by literature review .  
novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) caused an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) from december 2019 in china . 2019 - nc ##ov which was identified is a kind of beta corona ##virus belongs to one of four corona ##virus genera . except 2019 - nc ##ov , two other beta corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are also quite harmful to human beings . 2019 - nc ##ov uses the same cell entry receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , as sar ##s - co ##v . and dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) or cd ##26 is the cell receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . the expression of ace ##2 was found to have obvious positive expression in human corn ##eal and con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l ep ##ith ##eli ##um , and corn ##eal end ##oth ##eli ##um . d ##pp ##4 activity was presented in normal animal con ##jun ##ct ##iva ##l ep ##ith ##eli ##um and fi ##bro ##bla ##sts of the sub ##ja ##cent connect ##ive tissue . it was also presented in the whole corn ##eal ep ##ith ##eli ##um and tear fluid of animal with severe injured corn ##ea ##s . the two receptors , ace ##2 and d ##pp ##4 , involve in many cellular & n ##bs ##p ; signaling & n ##bs ##p ; pathways and path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logical & n ##bs ##p ; processes . their expression in the cells of o ##cular surface may be an access route of corona virus in eye , which provides clues to el ##uc ##ida ##ting the pathogen ##esis of corona virus in the eye ##balls .  
objective to analyze the ct manifestation ##s of the 2019 novel corona ##virus pneumonia ( nc ##p ) combined with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) literature review , and to sum ##mar ##ize the characteristics of ct imaging , so as to improve the ability of rapid and accurate diagnosis . methods ct manifestation ##s of two confirmed cases of nc ##p were reported , meanwhile the literature ##s on sar ##s and mer ##s imaging performance were reviewed and summarized . results the two cases of nc ##p were both in acute stage , the ct imaging showed multiple and scattered ground - glass op ##ac ##ity ( g ##go ) in both lungs , which is similar to the ct performance of sar ##s and mer ##s in acute stage . conclusions the ct features of 2019 novel corona ##virus pneumonia are similar to sar ##s and mer ##s . it has certain characteristics and changes rapidly with the course of the disease . in the acute stage , g ##go and paving stone sign were the main manifestation ##s . in the acute phase , g ##go and crazy paving are the main manifestation ##s . in the progress stage , the inter ##lo ##bular sept ##al thick ##ening and consolidation appeared . during the absorption period , the lesions disappeared or fi ##bro ##sis was left behind , with lung structure distortion and bro ##nch ##iec ##tas ##is . l ##ym ##pha ##den ##opa ##thy and hydro ##thor ##ax were rare .  
pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus infections , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , cause high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality ##1 , 2 . recently , a severe pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) was reported at december 2019 in the city wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china ##3 , 4 , 5 , which was also named as pneumonia - associated respiratory syndrome ( par ##s ) 6 and can cause corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) to seriously end ##anger human health . up to 24th of february 2020 , at least 77 ##7 ##7 ##9 cases have been reported with 266 ##6 fatal cases according to the report from china cdc . however , the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from co ##vid - 19 patients is still unknown . here we show that after the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , cd ##4 + t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogen ##ic t help ##er ( th ) 1 cells and generate gm - cs ##f etc . the cy ##tok ##ines environment induce ##s inflammatory cd ##14 + cd ##16 + mono ##cytes with high expression of il - 6 and accelerate the inflammation . given that large amount of inflammatory cells in ##filtration ##s have been observed in lungs from severe co ##vid - 19 patients ##7 , 8 , these abe ##rran ##t pathogen ##ic th ##1 cells and inflammatory mono ##cytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality . our results demonstrate that excessive non - effective host immune responses by pathogen ##ic t cells and inflammatory mono ##cytes may associate with severe lung pathology . thus , we suggest that mono ##cl ##onal antibodies targeting gm - cs ##f or inter ##le ##uki ##n 6 may be effective in blocking inflammatory storms and , therefore , be a promising treatment of severe co ##vid - 19 patients 
since december 2019 , corona virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , an emerging infection disease occurred in wu ##han , has spread in the mainland china . the epidemic factors on the basis of knowledge of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were discussed in this paper . this puts a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a novel corona virus , the onset of co ##vid - 19 is slow , and the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 remains unclear and may lead to multiple organ damage . these put a lot of pressure on clinical resources and care . source of infection including the patients , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carrier and patients in the inc ##uba ##tion period are con ##tag ##ious . it is difficult to control source of infection . routes of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 transmission are diversified and the main routes of transmission for co ##vid - 19 are drop ##let transmission and close contact transmission . all population have su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . social factors such population movements and aggregation accelerated the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the chinese government & rs ##qu ##o ; s adopted measures are positive and effective , and are accepted by the expert group from the world health organization . however , it will be a long - term hard work in the future to seriously sum ##mar ##ize and think deeply to achieve public health security in china .  
some researchers in china are unhappy with the designated name for the new corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . they worry that the use of ‘ sar ##s - co ##v ’ will confuse the public and imp ##ede efforts to control the pathogen ’ s spread .  
the outbreak of 2019 - novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) that is caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has spread rapidly in china , and has developed to be a public health emergency of international concern . however , no specific anti ##vira ##l treatments or vaccines are available yet . this work aims to share strategies and candidate antigen ##s to develop safe and effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . an outbreak of 2019 - novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) that causes at ##yp ##ical pneumonia ( co ##vid - 19 ) has raged in china since mid - december 2019 and has spread to 26 countries ( february 20 , 2020 ) . the epidemic was identified by the first four cases confirmed on december 29 , 2019 and was traced to the hua ##nan seafood wholesale market , wu ##han city , hub ##ei province , china ##1 . a total of 75 , 46 ##5 cases with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections have been confirmed up to date ( february 20 , 2020 ) , and 2 , 236 people have died in china ##2 . co ##vid - 19 spreads rapidly by human - to - human transmission with a median inc ##uba ##tion period of 3 . 0 days ( range , 0 to 24 . 0 ) , and the time from sy ##mpt ##om onset to developing pneumonia is 4 . 0 days ( range , 2 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) 3 . respiratory droplets and direct contact are conventional transmission routes for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and fe ##cal - to - oral transmission might also have a role ##3 . fever , dry cough , and fatigue are common symptoms at onset of co ##vid - 194 . most patients have l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia and bilateral ground - glass op ##ac ##ity changes on chest ct scans ##4 , 5 . no specific anti ##vira ##l treatments or vaccines are available because it is a new emerging viral disease . development of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - based vaccines is urgently required . the entire virus particle - based preparation of vaccines , including inactivated and at ##ten ##uated virus vaccines is ad ##vis ##able , because it is based on previous studies about the prevention and control of seasonal influenza vaccines ##6 . the first sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( wu ##han - hu - 1 ) was successfully sequence ##d and its gen ##omic sequence submitted to gen ##bank on january 5 , 2020 ( accession no . mn ##90 ##8 ##9 ##47 . 3 ) 7 . subsequently large - scale culture of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was quickly performed , and an inactivated virus vaccine could be prepared through the employment of established physical and chemical
we prepared the three - dimensional model of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( aka 2019 - nc ##ov ) 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) using the crystal structure of the highly similar ( 96 % identity ) or ##th ##olo ##g from the sar ##s - co ##v . all residues involved in the cat ##aly ##sis , substrate binding and dime ##ris ##ation are 100 % conserved . comparison of the poly ##pro ##tein pp ##1 ##ab sequences showed 86 % identity . the 3 ##c - like cleavage sites on the corona ##vira ##l poly ##pro ##tein ##s are highly conserved . based on the near - identical substrate specific ##ities and high sequence identities , we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the sar ##s - co ##v enzyme can be conferred on its sar ##s - co ##v - 2 counterpart . with the 3 ##cl ##pro molecular model , we performed virtual screening for pu ##rch ##asa ##ble drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration . among these , the anti ##vira ##ls led ##ip ##as ##vir or ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir are particularly attractive as therapeutic ##s to combat the new corona ##virus with minimal side effects , commonly fatigue and headache . the drugs ep ##cl ##usa ( ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir / so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir ) and ha ##r ##von ##i ( led ##ip ##as ##vir / so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir ) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitor ##y actions on two viral enzymes .  
the outbreak of novel corona ##virus pneumonia ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused thousands of deaths worldwide , and the number of total infections is still rising . however , the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months . thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately . fortunately , some compounds that can inhibit corona ##virus in vitro have been reported . in this study , the corona ##virus - specific data ##set was used to fine - tune our pre - trained multi - task deep model . next we used the re - trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the results show that aba ##ca ##vir , a powerful nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog reverse transcript ##ase inhibitor used to treat hiv , is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . al ##mit ##rine me ##sy ##late and ro ##fl ##umi ##las ##t which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic ob ##st ##ru ##ctive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitor ##y effect . overall , ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited . we hope these results would be useful in the fight against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the outbreak of co ##vid - 19 caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has rapidly spread worldwide and has caused over 1 , 400 , 000 infections and 80 , 000 deaths . there are currently no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy for its prevention and little knowledge was known about the pathogen ##ici ##ty mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . previous studies showed both virus and host - derived micro ##rna ##s ( mir ##nas ) played crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection . in this study , we use computational approaches to scan the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome for put ##ative mir ##nas and predict the virus mir ##na targets on virus and human genome as well as the host mir ##nas targets on virus genome . furthermore , we explore mir ##nas involved d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation caused by the virus infection . our results implicated that the immune response and cy ##tos ##kel ##eto ##n organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection - mod ##ulated mir ##nas . impressive ##ly , we found hs ##a - mir - 46 ##6 ##1 - 3 ##p was predicted to target the s gene of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and a virus - encoded mir ##na mr ##14 ##7 - 3 ##p could enhance the expression of t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 with the function of strengthening sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in the gut . the study may provide important clues for the me ##chi ##sms of pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
corona ##virus ##es are a class of virus responsible of the recent outbreak of human severe acute respiratory syndrome . the molecular machinery behind the viral entry and thus in ##fect ##ivity is based on the formation of the complex of virus spike protein with the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . the detection of put ##ative all ##ost ##eric sites on the viral spike protein can trace the path to develop all ##ost ##eric drugs to weaken the strength of the spike - ace ##2 interface and , thus , reduce the viral in ##fect ##ivity . in this work we present results of the application of the protein contact network ( pc ##n ) paradigm to the complex sar ##s - co ##v spike - ace ##2 relative to both 2003 sar ##s and the recent 2019 - co ##v . results point to a specific region , present in both structures , that is predicted to act as all ##ost ##eric site mod ##ulating the binding of the spike protein with ace ##2 .  
the co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic triggered by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a worldwide health disaster . main pro ##tea ##se is an attractive drug target among corona ##virus ##es , due to its vital role in processing the poly ##pro ##tein ##s that are translated from the viral rna . there is presently no exact drug or treatment for this diseases caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . in the present study , we report the potential inhibitor ##y activity of some fda approved drugs against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 main pro ##tea ##se by molecular docking study to investigate their binding affinity in pro ##tea ##se active site . docking studies revealed that drug os ##elt ##ami ##vir ( anti - h ##1 ##n ##1 drug ) , ri ##fa ##mp ##in ( anti - tb drug ) , mara ##vir ##oc , et ##ra ##vir ##ine , ind ##ina ##vir , ri ##lp ##iv ##iri ##ne ( anti - hiv drugs ) and at ##ova ##qu ##one , qui ##ni ##dine , halo ##fan ##tri ##ne , am ##od ##ia ##quin ##e , te ##tra ##cy ##lc ##ine , az ##ith ##rom ##y ##cin , hydro ##xy ##cho ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( anti - malaria ##l drugs ) among others binds in the active site of the pro ##tea ##se with similar or higher affinity . however , the in - si ##lic ##o abilities of the drug molecules tested in this study , further needs to be valid ##ated by carrying out in vitro and in vivo studies . moreover , this study spreads the potential use of current drugs to be considered and used to comprise the fast expanding sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
the world has witnessed unprecedented human and economic loss from the co ##vid - 19 disease , caused by the novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . extensive research is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents against the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . here , we use a powerful and efficient computational strategy by combining machine learning ( ml ) based models and high - fidelity ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules ( or ligand ##s ) . our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s - protein at its host receptor region or to the sp ##rot ##ein - human ace ##2 interface complex , thereby potentially limiting and / or disrupt ##ing the host - virus interactions . we first apply our screening strategy to two drug data ##set ##s ( cure ##ffi and drug ##cent ##ral ) to identify hundreds of ligand ##s that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems . candidate ligand ##s were then valid ##ated by all atom docking simulations . the valid ##ated ml models were subsequently used to screen a large bio - molecule data ##set ( with nearly a million entries ) to provide a rank - ordered list of ~ 19 , 000 potentially useful compounds for further validation . overall , this work not only expands our knowledge of small - molecule treatment against co ##vid - 19 , but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high - through ##put computational drug screening by combining quick ml sur ##rogate models with expensive high - fidelity simulations , for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases .  
tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests , prevent ##ive vaccines , and therapeutic medicines for corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . much of this development has been based on the reference genome collected on january 5 , 2020 . based on the gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of 61 ##56 genome samples collected up to april 24 , 2020 , we report that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has had 44 ##59 alarm ##ingly mutations which can be clustered into five sub ##type ##s . we introduce mutation ratio and mutation $ h $ - index to character ##ize the protein conservative ##ness and un ##ve ##il that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 envelope protein , main pro ##tea ##se , and end ##ori ##bon ##uc ##lea ##se protein are relatively conservative , while sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , spike protein , and papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se are relatively non - conservative . in particular , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein has more than half its genes changed in the past few months , signaling devastating impacts on the ongoing development of co ##vid - 19 diagnosis , vaccines , and drugs .  
presently , india bears amongst the highest burden of non - com ##mun ##ica ##ble diseases such as diabetes mel ##lit ##us ( d ##m ) , hyper ##tension ( h ##t ) , and card ##io vascular disease ( cv ##d ) and thus represents a vulnerable target to the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 / co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic . involvement of the ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) in su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection and pathogen ##esis by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is currently an actively pursued research area . an increased su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection in individuals with d ##m , h ##t and cv ##d together with higher levels of circulating ace ##2 in these settings presents a scenario where interaction with soluble ace ##2 may result in di ##sse ##minated virus - receptor complexes that could enhance virus acquisition and pathogen ##esis . thus , understanding the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptor binding domain - ace ##2 interaction , both membrane bound and in the cell free context may contribute to el ##uc ##ida ##ting the role of co - mor ##bid ##ities in increased su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to infection and pathogen ##esis . both az ##ith ##rom ##y ##cin and hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e ( hc ##q ) have shown efficacy in mit ##iga ##ting viral carriage in infected individuals . furthermore , each of these compounds generate active meta ##bol ##ites which in turn may also mod ##ulate virus - receptor interaction and thus influence clinical outcomes . in this study , we model the structural interaction of s ##1 with both full - length and soluble ace ##2 . additionally , therapeutic drugs and their active meta ##bol ##ites were docked with soluble ace ##2 protein . our results show that s ##1 from either of the reported indian sequences can bind both full - length and soluble ace ##2 , albeit with varying affinity that can be attributed to a reported substitution in the rb ##d . furthermore , both az ##yt ##hr ##omy ##cin and hc ##q together with their active meta ##bol ##ites can all ##ost ##eric ##ally affect , to a range of extent ##s , binding of s ##1 to ace ##2 .  
corona ##virus ##es have recently caused world - wide severe outbreak ##s : sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) in 2002 and mer ##s ( middle - east respiratory syndrome ) in 2012 . at the end of 2019 , a new corona ##virus outbreak appeared in wu ##han ( china ) seafood market as first focus of infection , becoming a pan ##de ##mics in 2020 , spreading mainly into europe and asia . although the virus family is well - known , this specific virus presents considerable differences , as higher transmission rates , being a challenge for diagnostic methods , treatments and vaccines . corona ##virus . pro is a c + + application which simulate ##s corona ##virus replication cycle . this software has identified virus type in short times and provided fast ##a files of virus proteins , a list of mrna sequences and secondary structures . furthermore , the software has identified a list of structural , non - structural and accessory proteins in 2019 - nc ##ov virus genome more similar to sar ##s than to mer ##s , as several fusion proteins characteristics of this virus type . these results are useful as a first step in order to develop diagnostic methods , new vaccines or anti ##vira ##l drugs , which could avoid virus replication in any stage : fusion inhibitors , rd ##rp inhibitors and pl ##2 ##pro / 3 ##cl ##pro pro ##tea ##se inhibitors .  
the novel corona ##virus disease , co ##vid - 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus - 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , has resulted in thousands of critically ill patients and poses a serious threat globally . to investigate if sar ##s - co ##v - 2 can affect early human embryo ##s , we anal ##yse ##d sc ##rna - se ##q data ##set ##s of human embryo ##s for the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 receptors ace ##2 and bs ##g ( cd ##14 ##7 ) , the ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 for viral spike protein pri ##ming , and the end ##osomal pro ##tea ##se ct ##sl for spike protein activation via the end ##osomal route . the results reveal that ace ##2 and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 are co - expressed in a proportion of ep ##ib ##las ##t cells , and both bs ##g and ct ##sl are expressed in all the stages of embryo ##nic development . the cells of the blast ##oc ##yst ##s express genes encoding for other corona ##virus receptors such as d ##pp ##4 and an ##pe ##p as well . interesting ##ly , the cells of the ep ##ib ##las ##t also express genes involved in viral end ##oc ##yt ##osis and replication . we further identified 194 genes that are differential ##ly expressed in ace ##2 - and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - positive cells as compared to ace ##2 - and t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - negative cells of the ep ##ib ##las ##t . our results show that developing human embryo ##s express the receptors for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other corona ##virus ##es ; embryo ##s also harbour the necessary machinery for viral internal ##ization and replication . we suggest that couples be advised to avoid con ##ce ##iving during the pan ##de ##mic and that iv ##f procedures be kept to a minimum to prevent any possible hazard to the developing embryo ##s .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has characters ##tics of wide con ##tag ##ion and quick velocity of propagation . this technical report carries out a mini test to extract visual features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 with its first ground truth image in related res ##ea ##ch domains .  
co ##vid - 19 , since emerged in wu ##han , china , has been a major concern due to its high infection rate , leaving more than one million infected people around the world . huge number of studies tried to reveal the structure of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 compared to the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 , in order to suppress this high infection rate . some of these studies showed that the mutations in the sar ##s - co ##v - 1 spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ace ##2 human cell receptor . in this work , we used molecular dynamics simulations and monte carlo sampling to compare the binding af ##fin ##ities of the spike proteins of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to the ace ##2 . we found that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 binds to ace ##2 stronger than sar ##s - co ##v by 7 kc ##al / mo ##l , due to enhanced electro ##static interactions . the major contributions to the electro ##static binding energies are resulting from the salt - bridges formed between r ##42 ##6 and ace ##2 - e ##32 ##9 in case of sar ##s - co ##v and k ##41 ##7 and ace ##2 - d ##30 for sar ##s - co ##v ##2 . in addition , there is no significant contribution from a single mutant to the binding energies . however , these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies . our results also indicate that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus .  
co ##vid - 19 has affected the world tremendous ##ly . it is critical that biological experiments and clinical designs are informed by computational approaches for time - and cost - effective solutions . comparative analyses particularly can play a key role to reveal structural changes in proteins due to mutations , which can lead to behaviour ##al changes , such as the increased binding of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein to human ace ##2 receptors . the aim of this report is to provide an easy to follow tutor ##ial for biologist ##s and others without del ##ving into different bio ##in ##form ##atics tools . more complex analyses such as the use of large - scale computational methods can then be ut ##ilised . starting with a sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome sequence , the report shows visual ##ising dna sequence features , der ##iving amino acid sequences , and align ##ing different genome ##s to anal ##yse mutations and differences . the report provides further insights into how the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein mu ##tated for higher binding affinity to human ace ##2 receptors , compared to the sar ##s - co ##v protein , by integrating existing 3d protein models .  
the pan ##de ##mic prevalence of co ##vid - 19 has become a very serious global health issue . scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the discovery of a drug to combat sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . it has been found that rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) plays a crucial role in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication , and thus could be a potential drug target . here , comprehensive computational approaches including drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting rd ##rp of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . this study revealed that ri ##fa ##bu ##tin , ri ##fa ##pen ##tine , fi ##da ##x ##omic ##in , 7 - methyl - gu ##ano ##sin ##e - 5 ' - trip ##hos ##phate - 5 ' - gu ##ano ##sin ##e and iv ##er ##me ##ct ##in have a potential inhibitor ##y interaction with rd ##rp of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , and could be effective drugs for co ##vid - 19 . in addition , virtual screening of the compounds from zinc database also allowed the prediction of two compounds ( zinc ##0 ##9 ##12 ##8 ##25 ##8 and zinc 09 ##8 ##8 ##33 ##0 ##5 ) with ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore features that interact effectively with rd ##rp of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; indicating their potential ##ity as effective inhibitors of the enzyme . furthermore , ad ##me analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also investigated to check the ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic ##s and drug - likeness properties of the two compounds . comparative structural analysis of protein - inhibitor complexes revealed that positions of the amino acid y ##32 , k ##47 , y ##12 ##2 , y ##12 ##9 , h ##13 ##3 , n ##13 ##8 , d ##14 ##0 , t ##14 ##1 , s ##70 ##9 and n ##7 ##8 ##1 are crucial for drug surface hot ##sp ##ot in the rd ##rp of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on hub ##ei province , china and is a major public health concern . taxonomic ##ally 2019 - nc ##ov is closely related to sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - related bat corona ##virus ##es , and it appears to share a common receptor with sar ##s - co ##v ( ace - 2 ) . here , we perform structural modeling of the 2019 - nc ##ov spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v , despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module . compared to sar ##s - co ##v , we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding ( s ##1 ) and fusion ( s ##2 ) domains , which we predict to be pro ##te ##ol ##ytic ##ally - sensitive . we suggest this loop con ##fers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with mer ##s - co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es , and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019 - nc ##ov may affect virus stability and transmission .  
corona ##virus disease - 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is an infectious disease caused by the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 virus . it was first identified in wu ##han , china , and has since spread causing a global pan ##de ##mic . various studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing candidates . however , such information is spread across many publications and it is very time - consuming to access , integrate , explore , and exploit . we developed cove ##x , the first interactive online platform for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 1 host interact ##ome exploration and drug ( target ) identification . cove ##x integrate ##s 1 ) experimental ##ly valid ##ated virus - human protein interactions , 2 ) human protein - protein interactions and 3 ) drug - target interactions . the web interface allows user - friendly visual exploration of the virus - host interact ##ome and implements systems medicine algorithms for network - based prediction of drugs . thus , cove ##x is an important resource , not only to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v - 1 pathogen ##ici ##ty , but also in clinical research for the identification and prior ##iti ##zation of candidate therapeutic ##s . we apply cove ##x to investigate recent h ##yp ##oth ##eses on a systems biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving the virus life cycle . furthermore , we extract and discuss drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing candidates involved in these mechanisms . cove ##x render ##s co ##vid - 19 drug research systems - medicine - ready by giving the scientific community direct access to network medicine algorithms integrating virus - host - drug interactions . it is available at https : / / ex ##bio . w ##z ##w . tu ##m . de / cove ##x / .  
the emerging global infectious co ##vid - 19 corona ##virus disease by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late december 2019 in china . the virus has gone through various pathways of evolution . for understanding the evolution and transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of virus isolate ##s is of great importance . we present an accurate method for effectively gen ##ot ##yp ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 viruses using complete genome ##s . the method employs the multiple sequence alignment ##s of the genome isolate ##s with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reference genome . the s ##np gen ##otype ##s are then measured by ja ##cca ##rd distances to track the relationship of virus isolate ##s . the gen ##ot ##yp ##ing analysis of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the pre ##dom ##inated mutation type during the current epidemic . our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogen ##ic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations . the gen ##ot ##yp ##ing analysis shows that the genes encoding the s proteins and rna polymer ##ase , rna prima ##se , and nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein , undergo frequent mutations . these mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control .  
abstract two candidate small interfering rna ##s ( sir ##nas ) corresponding to severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike gene were designed and in vitro transcribed to explore the possibility of si ##len ##cing sar ##s - co ##v s gene . the pl ##as ##mi ##d peg ##fp - opt ##s , which contains the cod ##on - opt ##imi ##zed sar ##s - co ##v s gene and expresses spike - e ##gf ##p fusion protein ( s - e ##gf ##p ) as si ##len ##cing target and expressing reporter , was trans ##fect ##ed with sir ##nas into he ##k 293 ##t cells . at various time points of post ##tra ##ns ##fect ##ion , the levels of s - e ##gf ##p expression and amounts of spike mrna transcript were detected by flu ##orescence microscopy , flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry , western b ##lot , and real - time quantitative pc ##r , respectively . the results showed that the cells trans ##fect ##ed with peg ##fp - opt ##s expressed s - e ##gf ##p fusion protein at a higher level compared with those trans ##fect ##ed with peg ##fp - s , which contains wild ##type sar ##s - co ##v spike gene sequence . the green flu ##orescence , mean flu ##orescence intensity , and sar ##s - co ##v s rna transcript ##s were found significantly reduced , and the expression of sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was strongly inhibit ##ed in those cells co - trans ##fect ##ed with either e ##gf ##p - or s - specific sir ##nas . our findings demonstrated that the s - specific sir ##nas used in this study were able to specifically and effectively inhibit sar ##s - co ##v s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein expression in culture ##d cells through blocking the accumulation of s mrna , which may provide an approach for studies on the functions of sar ##s - co ##v s gene and development of novel prop ##hyl ##actic or therapeutic agents for sar ##s - co ##v .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected more than 1900 humans , since 2012 . the syndrome ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death . the virus is believed to be circulating in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s without notable symptoms since the 1980s . therefore , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are considered the only animal source of infection . neither anti ##vira ##l drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area . here , we developed four vaccine candidates against mer ##s - co ##v based on chad ##ox ##1 and mv ##a viral vectors , two candidates per vector . all vaccines contained the full - length spike gene of mer ##s - co ##v ; chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue pl ##as ##min ##ogen act ##iva ##tor gene ( t ##pa ) where mv ##a mer ##s vaccines were produced with t ##pa , but either the m ##h ##5 or f1 ##1 promoter driving expression of the spike gene . all vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime - boost regime ##ns . chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s with t ##pa induced higher neutral ##ising antibodies than chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s without t ##pa . a single dose of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s with t ##pa eli ##cite ##d cellular immune responses as well as neutral ##ising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by mv ##a mer ##s . the humor ##al im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of a single dose of chad ##ox ##1 mer ##s with t ##pa was equivalent to two doses of mv ##a mer ##s ( also with t ##pa ) . mv ##a mer ##s with m ##h ##5 or f1 ##1 promoter induced similar antibody levels ; however , f1 ##1 promoter enhanced the cellular im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of mv ##a mer ##s to significantly higher magnitude ##s . in conclusion , our study showed that mer ##s - co ##v vaccine candidates could be opt ##imi ##zed by ut ##ilis ##ing different viral vectors , various genetic designs of the vectors , or different regime ##ns to increase im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . chad ##ox ##1 and mv ##a vector ##ed vaccines have been safely evaluated in camel ##s and humans and these mer ##s vaccine candidates should now be tested in camel ##s and in clinical trials .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified in 2012 as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of a severe , lethal respiratory disease occurring across several countries in the middle east . to date there have been over 1600 laboratory confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v in 26 countries with a case fatal ##ity rate of 36 % . given the endemic region , it is possible that mer ##s - co ##v could spread during the annual ha ##j ##j pilgrimage , nec ##ess ##itating counter ##me ##as ##ure development . in this report , we describe the clinical and radio ##graphic changes of r ##hes ##us monkeys following infection with 5 ##× ##10 ##6 p ##fu mer ##s - co ##v jordan - n ##3 / 2012 . two groups of nh ##ps were treated with either a human anti - mer ##s mono ##cl ##onal antibody 3 ##b ##11 - n or e ##41 ##0 - n , an anti - hiv antibody . mer ##s - co ##v jordan - n ##3 / 2012 infection resulted in quan ##ti ##fia ##ble changes by computed tom ##ography , but limited other clinical signs of disease . 3 ##b ##11 - n treated subjects developed significantly reduced lung pathology when compared to infected , un ##tre ##ated subjects , indicating that this antibody may be a suitable mer ##s - co ##v treatment .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) envelope ( e ) protein is a vi ##rop ##orin involved in vi ##ru ##lence . e protein ion channel ( ic ) activity is specifically correlated with enhanced pulmonary damage , ed ##ema accumulation and death . il - 1 ##β driven pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mation is associated with those path ##ological signatures , however its link to ic activity remains unknown . in this report , we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v e protein forms protein – lip ##id channels in er ##gic / go ##l ##gi membranes that are per ##me ##able to calcium ions , a highly relevant feature never reported before . calcium ions together with ph mod ##ulated e protein por ##e charge and select ##ivity . interesting ##ly , e protein ic activity boosted the activation of the nl ##rp ##3 in ##fl ##am ##mas ##ome , leading to il - 1 ##β over ##pro ##duction . calcium transport through the e protein ic was the main trigger of this process . these findings striking ##ly link sar ##s - co ##v e protein ic induced ionic disturbances at the cell level to im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ological consequences and disease worse ##ning in the infected organism .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus , and has become pan ##de ##mic within a short period of time . imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis , management and follow - up of patients with sar ##s . the current status of imaging in sar ##s is presented in this review .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has become a global public health emergency . p ##38 mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) and its downstream targets are activated in sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells and activation of p ##38 map ##k enhance ##s the cy ##top ##athic effects of sar ##s - co ##v infection . in addition , weak activation of ak ##t cannot prevent sar ##s - co ##v infection - induced ap ##op ##tosis in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . in the present study , we demonstrated that signal trans ##du ##cer and act ##iva ##tor of transcription ( stat ) 3 , which is con ##sti ##tu ##tively ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated at ty ##ros ##ine ( ty ##r ) - 70 ##5 and slightly ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated at ser ##ine ( ser ) - 72 ##7 in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , was de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated at ty ##r - 70 ##5 on sar ##s - co ##v infection . in addition to ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of p ##38 map ##k in virus - infected cells , other map ##ks , i . e . , extra ##cellular signal - regulated kinase ( er ##k ) 1 / 2 and c - jun n - terminal kinase ( j ##nk ) , were ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated . although inhibitors of er ##k ##1 / 2 and j ##nk ( pd ##9 ##80 ##59 and sp ##60 ##01 ##25 ) had no effect on ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation status of stat ##3 , inhibitors of p ##38 map ##k ( sb ##20 ##35 ##80 and sb ##20 ##21 ##90 ) partially inhibit ##ed de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of stat ##3 at ty ##r - 70 ##5 . ty ##r - 70 ##5 - ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated stat ##3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells , whereas stat ##3 disappeared from the nucleus in virus - infected cells . as stat ##3 acts as an act ##iva ##tor of transcription in the nucleus , these results suggest that stat ##3 lacks its activity on transcription in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells .  
abstract the recent emergence of two highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v , has ignited a strong interest in the identification of viral factors that determine the vi ##ru ##lence and pathogen ##esis of co ##vs . the non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein 1 ( ns ##p ##1 ) of co ##vs has attracted considerable attention in this regard as a potential vi ##ru ##lence factor and a target for co ##v vaccine development because of acc ##um ##ulating evidence that point to its role in the down ##re ##gul ##ation of host innate immune responses to co ##v infection . studies have revealed both functional conservation and me ##chan ##istic diver ##gence among the ns ##p ##1 of different mammalian co ##vs in per ##tur ##bing host gene expression and anti ##vira ##l responses . this review sum ##mar ##izes the current knowledge about the biological functions of co ##v ns ##p ##1 that provides an insight into the novel strategies utilized by this viral protein to mod ##ulate host and viral gene expression during co ##v infection .  
corona ##virus ##es responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) can cause severe adverse pregnancy outcomes , such as mis ##carriage , premature delivery , intra ##uter ##ine growth restriction , and maternal death . 1 , 2 vertical transmission of the virus responsible for 2019 novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , has not yet been detected , whereas per ##ina ##tal transmission has been suspected in one case . 3 consequences of infection with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 for pre ##gnan ##cies are uncertain , with no evidence so far of severe outcomes for mothers and infants ; however , the possibility should be considered . 4 the recent experience with z ##ika virus suggests that when a new pathogen emerges , the health - care community should be prepared for the worst - case scenario . 5 therefore , recommendations for management of pregnant women at risk of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection are urgently needed . to this end , we propose a detailed management algorithm for health - care providers ( appendix ) .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been known to recognize and bind to host receptors , whose conform ##ation ##al changes then facilitate fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane , leading to viral entry into target cells . however , other functions of sar ##s - co ##v s protein such as pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage and its implications to viral infection are incomplete ##ly understood . in this study , we demonstrated that the infection of sar ##s - co ##v and a pseudo ##virus bearing the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v was inhibit ##ed by a pro ##tea ##se inhibitor ben - hc ##l . also , the pro ##tea ##se factor x ##a , a target of ben - hc ##l abundant ##ly expressed in infected cells , was able to cl ##ea ##ve the rec ##om ##bina ##nt and pseudo ##vira ##l s protein into s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s , and the cleavage was inhibit ##ed by ben - hc ##l . furthermore , this cleavage correlated with the in ##fect ##ivity of the pseudo ##virus . taken together , our study suggests a plausible mechanism by which sar ##s - co ##v cl ##ea ##ves its s protein to facilitate viral infection .  
background / purpose an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) occurred in taiwan from april to july 2003 . a nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak of sar ##s occurred at ka ##oh ##si ##ung chang gun ##g memorial hospital ( c ##gm ##h ) in may 2003 . the purpose of our study was to survey the prevalence of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) in a community adjacent to ka ##oh ##si ##ung c ##gm ##h and collect demographic data , including basic information about health status , household , and possible risk factors for sar ##s - co ##v infection . methods we randomly recruited 103 ##0 persons living in three precinct ##s adjacent to ka ##oh ##si ##ung c ##gm ##h . for all subjects , we collected demographic data and measured the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of the sar ##s - co ##v with an enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) and an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) . results the elisa was ser ##op ##osi ##tive for 124 of 103 ##0 participants ( 12 % ) . the more sensitive and specific if ##a confirmed sar ##s in only two cases ( 0 . 19 % ) . both confirmed cases were under 19 years of age and had no known sar ##s - related risk factors . conclusion there was low post - epidemic ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of sar ##s - co ##v in a community adjacent to a hospital which had a nos ##oco ##mia ##l sar ##s outbreak . the sar ##s outbreak in taiwan was primarily limited to hospital settings .  
summary several countries in the middle east and around 22 countries worldwide have reported cases of human infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . the exceptionally high fatal ##ity rate resulting from mer ##s - co ##v infection in conjunction with the pau ##city of knowledge about this emerging virus has led to major public and international concern . within the framework of the national acute respiratory illness surveillance , the ministry of health in the sultanate of oman has announced two confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v to date . the aim of this report is to describe the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological aspects of these two cases and to highlight the importance of public health prepared ##ness and response . the absence of secondary cases among contacts of the reported cases can be seen as evidence of the effectiveness of infection prevention and control precautions as an important pillar of the national prepared ##ness and response plan applied in the health care institutions in oman .  
after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in the world in 2003 , human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) have been reported as pathogen ##s that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections . recently , a new emerged hc ##ov isolated from the respiratory ep ##ith ##eli ##um of une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d pneumonia patients in the wu ##han seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . this virus causes acute lung symptoms , leading to a condition that has been named as & ld ##qu ##o ; corona ##virus disease 2019 & rd ##qu ##o ; ( co ##vid - 19 ) . the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and of sar ##s - co ##v caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security . there are some similarities and differences in the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses . the goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the context of their virus inc ##uba ##tion , origin ##ations , diagnosis and treatment methods , gen ##omic and pro ##te ##omic sequences , and pathogen ##ic mechanisms .  
since december 2019 , china has been experiencing a large outbreak of a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) which can cause respiratory disease and severe pneumonia . we estimated the basic reproduction number r ( 0 ) of 2019 - nc ##ov to be around 2 . 2 ( 90 % high density interval : 1 . 4 – 3 . 8 ) , indicating the potential for sustained human - to - human transmission . transmission characteristics appear to be of similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome - related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and pan ##de ##mic influenza , indicating a risk of global spread .  
abstract this report describes the production of several mab ##s against n ##19 ##5 protein , a major im ##mun ##od ##oma ##in of sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein [ he , q . , chong , k . h . , chang , h . h . , leung , b . , ling , a . e . , wei , t . , chan , s . w . , o ##oi , e . e . , kwan ##g , j . , 2004 . development of a western b ##lot ass ##ay for detection of antibodies against corona ##virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome . cl ##in . dia ##gn . lab . im ##mun ##ol . 11 ( 2 ) 417 – 422 . ] . one representative i ##gg ##1 mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) , s - a ##5 ##d ##5 , was selected and characterized . s - a ##5 ##d ##5 reacted specifically react with both rec ##om ##bina ##nt and native nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein of sar ##s co ##v . the react ##ivity of s - a ##5 ##d ##5 with pu ##rified n ##19 ##5 protein and utilization of the mab as a detector antibody to develop an antigen capture elisa was assessed . as little as 37 . 5 ##pg of pu ##rified n protein and 50 tc ##id ##50 of sar ##s co ##v could be detected by the antigen capture elisa . specific binding of the mab s - a ##5 ##d ##5 to both pu ##rified n ##19 ##5 and sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antigen was effectively inhibit ##ed by human sar ##s positive serum and guinea pig anti - n ##19 ##5 serum . the n protein in n ##19 ##5 - spike rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus - infected sf - 9 cells could also be identified . n protein was detected in 18 if ##a i ##gm - positive serum samples collected from sar ##s confirmed patients , but not in nine samples collected from sar ##s recovery patient . no false positive results were given when 60 samples from healthy individuals were tested , and no cross - reaction occurred when infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) , chicken corona ##virus , was tested . this mono ##cl ##onal antibody - based antigen capture elisa is thus a powerful tool for early diagnosis of sar ##s co ##v infection .  
abstract many survivors of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) developed residual pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis with increased severity seen in older patients . auto ##ps ##ies of patients that died from sar ##s also showed fi ##bro ##sis to varying extent ##s . pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis can be occasionally seen as a consequence to several respiratory viral infections but is much more common after a sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . given the threat of future outbreak ##s of severe corona ##virus disease , including middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , it is important to understand the mechanisms responsible for pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis , so as to support the development of therapeutic counter ##me ##as ##ures and mit ##igate sequel ##ae of infection . in this article , we sum ##mar ##ize pulmonary fi ##bro ##tic changes observed after a sar ##s - co ##v infection , discuss the extent to which other respiratory viruses induce fi ##bro ##sis , describe available animal models to study the development of sar ##s - co ##v induced fi ##bro ##sis and review evidence that pulmonary fi ##bro ##sis is caused by a hyper ##active host response to lung injury mediated by ep ##ider ##mal growth factor receptor ( e ##gf ##r ) signaling . we sum ##mar ##ize work from our group and others indicating that inhibit ##ing e ##gf ##r signaling may prevent an excessive fi ##bro ##tic response to sar ##s - co ##v and other respiratory viral infections and propose directions for future research .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused substantial mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in 2002 – 2003 . del ##eti ##on of the envelope ( e ) protein modest ##ly diminished virus growth in tissue culture but ab ##rogated vi ##ru ##lence in animals . here , we show that im ##mun ##ization with rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e or sar ##s - co ##v - δ [ e , 6 - 9 ##b ] ( deleted in accessory proteins ( 6 , 7 ##a , 7 ##b , 8 ##a , 8 ##b , 9 ##b ) in addition to e ) nearly completely protected bal ##b / c mice from fatal respiratory disease caused by mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v and partly protected ha ##ce ##2 t ##g mice from lethal disease . ha ##ce ##2 t ##g mice , which express the human sar ##s - co ##v receptor , are extremely susceptible to infection . we also show that rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e and rs ##ars - co ##v - δ [ e , 6 - 9 ##b ] induced anti - virus t cell and antibody responses . further , the e - deleted viruses were stable after 16 blind passages through tissue culture cells , with only a single mutation in the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein detected . the passage ##d virus remained av ##ir ##ulent in mice . these results suggest that rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e is an e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccine candidate that might be useful if sar ##s rec ##ur ##red .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has continued spreading since its emergence in 2012 with a mortality rate of 35 . 6 % , and is a potential pan ##de ##mic threat . prop ##hyl ##actic ##s and the ##ra ##pies are urgently needed to address this public health problem . we report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chi ##meric virus - like particles ( v ##lp ) expressing the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v . in this study , a fusion of the canine par ##vo ##virus ( cp ##v ) vp ##2 structural protein gene with the rb ##d of mer ##s - co ##v can self - assemble into chi ##meric , spherical v ##lp ( sv ##lp ) . sv ##lp retained certain par ##vo ##virus characteristics , such as the ability to ag ##gl ##uti ##nate pig er ##yt ##hr ##ocytes , and structural morphology similar to cp ##v vi ##rion ##s . im ##mun ##ization with sv ##lp induced rb ##d - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses in mice . sv ##lp - specific anti ##ser ##a from these animals were able to prevent pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##v entry into susceptible cells , with neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters reaching 1 : 320 . if ##n - γ , il - 4 and il - 2 secret ##ing cells induced by the rb ##d were detected in the sp ##len ##ocytes of va ##cci ##nated mice by eli ##sp ##ot . furthermore , mice in ##oc ##ulated with sv ##lp or an ad ##ju ##vant ##ed sv ##lp vaccine eli ##cite ##d t - help ##er 1 ( th ##1 ) and t - help ##er 2 ( th ##2 ) cell - mediated immunity . our study demonstrates that sv ##lp displaying the rb ##d of mer ##s - co ##v are promising prop ##hyl ##actic candidates against mer ##s - co ##v in a potential outbreak situation .  
summary the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a new type of corona ##virus . here , we have investigated the ability of aden ##ov ##ira ##l delivery of cod ##on - opt ##imi ##sed sar ##s - co ##v strain urban ##i structural antigen ##s spike protein s ##1 fragment , membrane protein , and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein to induce virus - specific broad immunity in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues . we im ##mun ##ised r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues intra ##mus ##cular ##ly with a combination of the three ad ##5 - sar ##s - co ##v vectors or a control vector and gave a booster va ##cci ##nation on day 28 . the va ##cci ##nated animals all had antibody responses against spike protein s ##1 fragment and t - cell responses against the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . all va ##cci ##nated animals showed strong neutral ##ising antibody responses to sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . these results show that an aden ##ov ##ira ##l - based vaccine can induce strong sar ##s - co ##v - specific immune responses in the monkey , and hold promise for development of a protective vaccine against the sar ##s causal agent .  
the recent emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v , a close relative of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v , both of which caused a lethal respiratory infection in humans , reinforce ##s the need for further understanding of corona ##virus pathogen ##esis and the host immune response . these viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade and block host immune responses , facilitating infection and transmission . pathogen ##esis following infection with these viruses is characterized by a marked delay in the induction of type i inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n i ) and , subsequently , by a poor adaptive immune response . the ##ra ##pies that ex ##ped ##ite if ##n i induction as well as interventions that ant ##ago ##ni ##ze im ##mun ##oe ##vas ##ive virus proteins are thus promising candidates for immune modulation .  
abstract since december 2019 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) , has posed a serious threat to global health and is currently causing a major pan ##de ##mic . while patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness , mounting evidence indicates that patients might also report extra - pulmonary manifestation ##s , including those affecting the liver and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract . this involvement may have important implications to the disease management , transmission , and pro ##gno ##sis , especially in patients with pre - existing he ##pati ##c or digest ##ive co - mor ##bid ##ities . in this review , the characteristics and possible explanations of he ##pati ##c and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal involvement caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection are summarized , adding to our knowledge of the spectrum of co ##vid - 19 . in addition , prevent ##ive measures implemented in end ##os ##co ##py departments to prevent further dissemination of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection are proposed .  
abstract objectives middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to cause frequent hospital outbreak ##s in saudi arabia , with emergency departments as the initial site of the spread of this virus . methods the risk of transmission of mer ##s - co ##v infection to healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) was assessed in an outbreak in ri ##yad ##h . all hc ##ws with un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 ##h of exposure . two negative results for mer ##s - co ##v obtained 3d ##ays apart and being free of any suggest ##ive signs and symptoms were used to end the isolation of the hc ##ws and allow their return to duty . results overall 17 out of 87 ##9 hc ##ws with different levels of exposure tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v . of the 15 positive hc ##ws with adequate follow - up , 40 % ( 6 / 15 hc ##ws ) tested positive on the first sampling and 53 % ( 8 / 15 ) tested positive on the second sampling . the time to negative results among the 15 positive hc ##ws ranged between 4 and 47 ##day ##s ( average 14 . 5 days ) and the infected hc ##ws needed on average two samples for clearance . all positive hc ##ws were either as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or had mild disease . conclusions the data obtained in this study support the widespread testing of all close contacts of mer ##s - co ##v cases , regardless of the significance of the contact or presence or absence of symptoms . in addition , urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s - co ##v - positive hc ##ws under investigation to active duty is needed .  
a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans , emerged in the middle east region in 2012 . this virus , named middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v , is phylogenetic ##ally related to bat co ##vs , but other animal species like dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s may potentially act as intermediate hosts by spreading the virus to humans . although human to human transmission has been demonstrated , analysis of human mer ##s clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self - sustaining , especially when infection control was implemented . thus , timely identification of new mer ##s cases followed by their qu ##aran ##tine , combined with measures to limit spread of the virus from the ( intermediate ) host to humans , may be crucial in controlling the outbreak of this emerging co ##v .  
abstract the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , sar ##s - co ##v , en ##codes two large poly ##pro ##tein ##s ( pp ##1 ##a and pp ##1 ##ab ) that are processed by two viral pro ##tea ##ses to yield mature non - structural proteins ( ns ##ps ) . many of these ns ##ps have essential roles in viral replication , but several have no assigned function and possess amino acid sequences that are unique to the co ##v family . one such protein is sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , which is processed from the n - terminus of both pp ##1 ##a and pp ##1 ##ab . the mature sar ##s - co ##v protein is present in cells several hours post - infection and co - local ##izes to the viral replication complex , but its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown . furthermore , ns ##p ##1 sequences are highly diver ##gent across the co ##v family , and it has been suggested that this is due to ns ##p ##1 possessing a function specific to viral interactions with its host cell or acting as a host specific vi ##ru ##lence factor . in order to initiate structural and bio ##physical studies of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , a rec ##om ##bina ##nt expression system and a purification protocol have been developed , yielding mill ##ig ##ram quantities of highly pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 . the pu ##rified protein was characterized using circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm , size exclusion ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy , and multi - angle light scattering .  
abstract background & aims : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently emerged infection from a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . apart from fever and respiratory complications , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with sar ##s but the significance remains und ##eter ##mined . here ##in , we describe the clinical , path ##olo ##gic , and vi ##rol ##og ##ic features of the int ##estinal involvement of this new viral infection . methods : a retrospective analysis of the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed sar ##s admitted for a major outbreak in hong kong in march 2003 was performed . int ##estinal specimens were obtained by colon ##os ##co ##py or post ##mo ##rte ##m examination to detect the presence of corona ##virus by electron microscopy , virus culture , and reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction . results : among these 138 patients with sar ##s , 28 ( 20 . 3 % ) presented with watery dia ##rr ##hea and up to 38 . 4 % of patients had symptoms of dia ##rr ##hea during the course of illness . dia ##rr ##hea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness . the mean number of days with dia ##rr ##hea was 3 . 7 ± 2 . 7 , and most dia ##rr ##hea was self - limiting . int ##estinal bio ##psy specimens obtained by colon ##os ##co ##py or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large int ##est ##ine . corona ##virus was also isolated by culture from these specimens , and sar ##s - co ##v rna can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after sy ##mpt ##om onset . conclusions : dia ##rr ##hea is a common presenting sy ##mpt ##om of sar ##s . the int ##estinal tr ##op ##ism of the sar ##s - co ##v has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission .  
abstract the im ##mun ##ological characteristics of sar ##s - co ##v spike protein were investigated by administering mice with pl ##as ##mi ##ds encoding various s gene fragments . we showed that the secret ##ing forms of s ##1 , s ##2 subunit ##s and the n - terminus of s ##1 subunit ( residues 18 – 495 ) were capable of eli ##cit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v specific antibodies and the region immediate to n - terminus of mature ##d s ##1 protein contained an important im ##mun ##ogenic deter ##mina ##nt for eli ##cit ##ation of sar ##s - co ##v specific antibodies . in addition , mice im ##mun ##ized with pl ##as ##mi ##ds encoding s ##1 fragment developed a th ##1 - mediated antibody iso ##type switching . another interesting finding was that mouse antibodies eli ##cite ##d separately by pl ##as ##mi ##ds encoding s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s cooperative ##ly neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v but neither the s ##1 nor s ##2 specific antibodies did , suggesting the possible role of both s ##1 and s ##2 subunit ##s in host cell docking and entry . these results provide insights into understanding the im ##mun ##ological characteristics of spike protein and the development of subunit vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that host anti ##vira ##l genes induced by type i inter ##fer ##ons might affect the natural course of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . we analyzed single nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism ##s ( s ##np ##s ) of 2 ′ , 5 ′ - ol ##igo ##ade ##ny ##late synth ##eta ##se 1 ( o ##as - 1 ) , my ##x ##ov ##irus resistance - a ( mx ##a ) , and double - stranded rna - dependent protein kinase in 44 vietnamese sar ##s patients with 103 controls . the g - all ##ele of non - synonymous a / g s ##np in ex ##on 3 of o ##as - 1 gene showed association with sar ##s ( p = 0 . 00 ##90 ) . the g - all ##ele in ex ##on 3 of o ##as - 1 and the one in ex ##on 6 were in strong link ##age di ##se ##quil ##ib ##rium and both of them were associated with sar ##s infection . the g ##g gen ##otype and g - all ##ele of g / t s ##np at position − ##8 ##8 in the mx ##a gene promoter were found more frequently in h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c group than in non - h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c group of sar ##s ( p = 0 . 01 ##9 ##5 ) . our findings suggest that poly ##morphism ##s of two if ##n - ind ##ucible genes o ##as - 1 and mx ##a might affect su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to the disease and progression of sar ##s at each level .  
us researchers have found that inhibitors of cat ##he ##ps ##in l enzyme prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) virus from entering target cells .  
abstract focused efforts by several international laboratories have resulted in the sequencing of the genome of the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v , in record time . using cumulative sk ##ew diagrams , i found that mutation ##al patterns in the sar ##s - co ##v genome were striking ##ly different from other corona ##virus ##es in terms of mutation rates , although they were in general agreement with the model of the corona ##virus life ##cycle . these findings might be relevant for the development of sequence - based diagnostic ##s and the design of agents to treat sar ##s .  
a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , which caused a large respiratory outbreak in wu ##han , china in december 2019 , is currently spreading across many countries globally . here , we show that a t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 - expressing ve ##ro ##e ##6 cell line is highly susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection , making it useful for iso ##lating and prop ##aga ##ting sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . our results reveal that , in common with sar ##s - and middle east respiratory syndrome - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is enhanced by t ##mp ##rs ##s ##2 .  
bats are the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) and likely the reservoir of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v . the clinical features of sar ##s - co ##v infection and mer ##s - co ##v infection are similar but mer ##s - co ##v infection progresses to respiratory failure more rapidly . although the estimated pan ##de ##mic potential of mer ##s - co ##v is lower than that of sar ##s - co ##v , the case fatal ##ity rate of mer ##s is higher . the transmission route and the possibility of other inter ##media ##ry animal sources remain uncertain among many sporadic primary cases . clinical trial options for mer ##s - co ##v infection include mono ##therapy and combination therapy .  
the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in the 21st century and the recent outbreak of middle - east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) highlight the importance of corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) as human pathogen ##s , emphasizing the need for development of novel anti ##vira ##l strategies to combat acute respiratory infections caused by co ##vs . recent studies suggest that nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins from corona ##virus ##es and other viruses can be useful anti ##vira ##l drug targets against viral infections . this review aims to provide readers with a con ##cise survey of the structural features of corona ##virus n proteins and how these features provide insights into structure - based development of therapeutic ##s against corona ##virus ##es . we will also present our latest results on mer ##s - co ##v n protein and its potential as an anti ##vira ##l drug target .  
abstract sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes inflammation and damage to the lungs resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome . to evaluate the molecular mechanisms behind this event , we investigated the roles of sar ##s - co ##v proteins in regulation of the pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory factor , cy ##cl ##oo ##xy ##genase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) . individual viral proteins were tested for their abilities to regulate cox - 2 gene expression . results showed that the cox - 2 promoter was activated by the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein in a concentration - dependent manner . western b ##lot analysis indicated that n protein was sufficient to stimulate the production of cox - 2 protein in mammalian cells . cox - 2 promoter mutations suggested that activation of cox - 2 transcription depended on two regulatory elements , a nuclear factor - kappa b ( n ##f - κ ##b ) binding site , and a cc ##aa ##t / enhance ##r binding protein ( c / e ##b ##p ) binding site . electro ##ph ##ore ##tic mobility shift ass ##ay ( ems ##a ) and ch ##rom ##atin im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ( chip ) demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v n protein bound directly to these regulatory sequences . protein mutation analysis revealed that a l ##ys - rich motif of n protein acted as a nuclear local ##ization signal and was essential for the activation of cox - 2 . in addition , a le ##u - rich motif was found to be required for the n protein function . a sequence of 68 residual ##s was identified as a potential dna - binding domain essential for act ##ivating cox - 2 expression . we propose that sar ##s - co ##v n protein causes inflammation of the lungs by act ##ivating cox - 2 gene expression by binding directly to the promoter resulting in inflammation through multiple cox - 2 signaling cascade ##s .  
abstract a fe ##rret model of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of an aden ##ov ##irus vaccine . animals were subjected to het ##ero ##log ##ous prime - boost using vectors from human ser ##otype 5 and chi ##mp ##an ##zee derived aden ##ov ##irus ##es ( human ad ##hu ##5 and chi ##mp ##an ##zee ad ##c ##7 ) expressing spike protein followed by intra ##nas ##al challenge with sar ##s - co ##v . va ##cci ##nation led to a substantial reduction in viral load and prevented the severe pneumonia seen in un ##vac ##cina ##ted animals . the same prime - boost strategy was effective in r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues in eli ##cit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v specific immune responses . these data indicate that a het ##ero ##log ##ous aden ##ov ##irus - based prime - boost vaccine strategy could safely stimulate strong immunity that may be needed for complete protection against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary history of travel or contact is an important clue to emerging infections . common and novel respiratory viruses can occasionally cause epidemic ##s of viral p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis with severe acute respiratory symptoms ( sar ##s ) . in 2003 , world health organisation ( who ) coined the word sar ##s for severe acute respiratory syndrome in patients with a relevant travel / contact history and sar ##s . the who case definition of suspected sar ##s was fever , respiratory symptoms and close contact with sar ##s patients or travel history to an epidemic area . the clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis . since 2003 , many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviation ##s appeared in the city of hong kong . in 2012 , another outbreak of corona ##virus p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis occurred in the middle - east . more case definitions such as mer ##s ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and sar ##i ( severe acute respiratory infections ) were coined for the viral p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis . in medicine , a definition or syndrome representing “ a constellation of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tology seen in association ” should stand the trial of time after it is coined . health organisations should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and pro ##gno ##stic ##ation studies . travel or contact history is pivotal in formula ##ting management protocol during any outbreak when the pathogen is not initially clear .  
abstract the exact residues within severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) s ##1 protein and its receptor , human ace ##2 , involved in their interaction still remain largely und ##eter ##mined . identification of exact amino acid residues that are crucial for the interaction of s ##1 with ace ##2 could provide working h ##yp ##oth ##eses for experimental studies and might be helpful for the development of anti ##vira ##l inhibitor . in this paper , a molecular docking model of sar ##s - co ##v s ##1 protein in complex with human ace ##2 was constructed . the interacting residue pairs within this complex model and their contact types were also identified . our model , supported by significant bio ##chemical evidence , suggested receptor - binding residues were concentrated in two segments of s ##1 protein . in contrast , the inter ##fa ##cial residues in ace ##2 , though close to each other in tertiary structure , were found to be widely scattered in the primary sequence . in particular , the s ##1 residue ar ##g ##45 ##3 and ace ##2 residue l ##ys ##34 ##1 might be the key residues in the complex formation .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which has overwhelmed more than 30 countries claiming nearly 840 ##0 cases with over 800 fatalities . thanks to the unprecedented international collaboration , the whole - genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##vs were successfully dec ##ip ##hered shortly after the identification of the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen for outbreak of sar ##s in southern china , in 2003 . hit ##her ##to , the sar ##s - co ##v , as a viral paradigm of emerging infectious entities , has been extensively studied that has ranged from ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , molecular vi ##rol ##ogy / im ##mun ##ology to structural gen ##omics . also , several lines of breakthrough ##s have been record - broken ##ly obtained , that included the finding of ace ##2 , a functional receptor for the sar ##s - co ##v , solution of the 3 ##cl ##pro structure , a first crystal structure of sar ##s - related macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s , revealing of bats as natural reservoirs for sar ##s - like viruses and the possible involvement of ci ##vet cats in the sar ##s emergence . this review intends to outline the major progress in the journey of sar ##s - related exploration , by emphasizing those inaugurated studies with milestone - like significance contributed by chinese research groups .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) proteins belong to a large group of proteins that is difficult to express in traditional expression systems . the ability to express and pu ##ri ##fy sar ##s - co ##v proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents . the work reported here demonstrates : ( 1 ) fusion of sumo ( small u ##bi ##qui ##tin - related mod ##ifier ) , a 100 amino acid poly ##pe ##pt ##ide , to the n - term ##ini of sar ##s - co ##v proteins dramatically enhance ##s expression in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli cells and ( 2 ) 6 ##× his - tagged sumo - fusion ##s facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale . we have exploited the natural cha ##per ##oning properties of sumo to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional method ##ologies . a unique feature of the system is the sumo tag , which enhance ##s expression , facilitates purification , and can be efficiently cl ##ea ##ved by a sumo - specific pro ##tea ##se to generate native protein with a desired n - terminus . we have pu ##rified various sar ##s - co ##v proteins under either native or den ##at ##uring conditions . these pu ##rified proteins have been used to generate highly specific poly ##cl ##onal antibodies . our study suggests that the sumo - fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and purification of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a newly identified member of family corona ##vir ##idae . corona ##virus envelope spike protein s is a class i viral fusion protein which is characterized by the existence of two he ##pta ##d repeat regions ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) ( forming a complex called fusion core ) . here we report that by using in vitro bio - engineering techniques , sar ##s - co ##v hr ##1 and hr ##2 bind to each other and form a typical 6 - helix bundle . the hr ##2 , either as a synthetic peptide or as a gs ##t - fusion poly ##pe ##pt ##ide , is a potent inhibitor of virus entry . the results do show that sar ##s - co ##v follows the general fusion mechanism of class i viruses and this lays the ground for identification of virus fusion / entry inhibitors for this devastating emerging virus .  
abstract objective the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 resulted in 34 ##6 probable sar ##s cases and 37 deaths in taiwan . this descriptive study , which was conducted from may to june 2003 , intended to identify staff stress and coping strategies among a sar ##s team of nursing staff during the outbreak . method twenty - six female nurses of the sar ##s team completed a question ##naire about their experiences serving in the sar ##s team . results sar ##s had both positive and negative psychological impacts on the nurses . while worrying about in ##fect ##ing their families and colleagues , nurses were able to cope with the situation through various means . additional findings include the need for more psychiatric staff to provide flexible and continuous service , the importance of meetings to improve team ##work and reduce conflict between doctors and nurses and the useful discovery that video cell phones provided needed re ##ass ##urance from afar to the worried families of the nurses . conclusion this study reinforce ##s the importance and benefits of psychiatric services for sar ##s team members in reducing their secondary trauma ##ti ##zation . it is hoped that the results will enhance our knowledge on the needs of front ##line health care workers and support the planning of better psychiatric services in future epidemic ##s .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute respiratory tract infectious disease that is associated with a new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . our recent study indicated that sar ##s - co ##v infection induce ##s activation of the p ##38 mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ( map ##k ) signaling pathway and the p ##38 map ##k inhibitor partially inhibit ##ed its cy ##top ##athic effect in ve ##ro e ##6 cells . the results of the present study indicated that before cell death , ak ##t , which is an inhibitor of ap ##op ##tosis , was also activated in response to viral replication . ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of a ser ##ine residue on ak ##t was detected at least 8 h post ##in ##fect ##ion ( hp ##i ) , which declined after 18 hp ##i . thus , the ph ##os ##pha ##ti ##dy ##lino ##sit ##ol 3 - kinase ( pi ##3 ##k ) / ak ##t pathway is activated in virus - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . however , a th ##re ##oni ##ne residue was not ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated . a downstream target of ak ##t , g ##ly ##co ##gen synth ##ase kinase 3 ##β ( gs ##k - 3 ##β ) , was slightly ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated , indicating that the level of activation of ak ##t was very low . p ##k ##c ##ζ , which is downstream of the pi ##3 ##k pathway , was also ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in virus - infected cells . these results suggested that weak activation of ak ##t cannot prevent ap ##op ##tosis induced by sar ##s - co ##v infection in ve ##ro e ##6 cells .  
abstract the s ##2 domain of the corona ##virus spike ( s ) protein is known to be responsible for media ##ting membrane fusion . in addition to a well - recognized cleavage site at the s ##1 – s ##2 boundary , a second pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) s ##2 domain ( r ##7 ##9 ##7 ) . c - terminal to this s ##2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cy ##stein ##e residues c ##8 ##22 and c ##8 ##33 . here , we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for sar ##s - co ##v s - mediated fusion activation . we show that the residues between c ##8 ##22 – c ##8 ##33 are well conserved across all corona ##virus ##es . mu ##tage ##nic analysis of sar ##s - co ##v s , combined with cell – cell fusion and pseudo ##type ##d vi ##rion in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ays , showed a critical role for the core - conserved residues c ##8 ##22 , d ##8 ##30 , l ##8 ##31 , and c ##8 ##33 . based on available predict ##ive models , we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cy ##stein ##es 82 ##2 and 83 ##3 forms a loop structure that interact ##s with components of the sar ##s - co ##v s trim ##er to control the activation of membrane fusion .  
an in - depth ann ##ota ##tion of the newly discovered corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) genome has revealed differences between 2019 - nc ##ov and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) or sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es . a systematic comparison identified 380 amino acid substitution ##s between these corona ##virus ##es , which may have caused functional and pathogen ##ic diver ##gence of 2019 - nc ##ov .  
background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus that causes a severe respiratory disease with high case fatal ##ity rate . starting in march 2014 , a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the arabian peninsula , many of which were acquired in health care settings . as of may 9 , 2014 , 53 ##6 laboratory - confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally . methods review of publicly available data about mer ##s - co ##v health care – associated transmission . results we identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care – associated transmission with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , mainly among patients with como ##rb ##idi ##ties . health care workers are also frequently affected ; however , they tend to have mild ##er symptoms and better pro ##gno ##sis . gaps in infection control were noted in all events . currently , health care – associated outbreak ##s are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the mer ##s - co ##v epidemic in countries in the arabian peninsula . conclusion there is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings . vaccines and anti ##vira ##l agents are urgently needed . overall , our knowledge about the ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic characteristics of mer ##s - co ##v that impact health care transmission is very limited . as the mer ##s - co ##v epidemic continues to evolve , issues concerning best infection control measures will arise , and studies to better define their effectiveness in real life are needed .  
background as reported by the world health organization , a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive virus of wu ##han pneumonia of unknown et ##iology by chinese authorities on 7 january , 2020 . the virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) by international committee on taxonomy of viruses on 11 february , 2020 . this study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the trans ##mis ##sibility of the virus . methods in this study , we developed a bats - hosts - reservoir - people transmission network model for sim ##ulating the potential transmission from the infection source ( probably be bats ) to the human infection . since the bats - hosts - reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from hua ##nan seafood wholesale market ( reservoir ) to people , we simplified the model as reservoir - people ( r ##p ) transmission network model . the next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number ( r 0 ) from the r ##p model to assess the trans ##mis ##sibility of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . results the value of r 0 was estimated of 2 . 30 from reservoir to person and 3 . 58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3 . 58 . conclusions our model showed that the trans ##mis ##sibility of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was higher than the middle east respiratory syndrome in the middle east countries , similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome , but lower than mer ##s in the republic of korea .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is the first major zoo ##not ##ic infectious disease of the 21st century . the disease , originally termed “ at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , ” was first recognized in november 2002 in guangdong province , china , which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 ##mont ##hs and eventually led to 80 ##9 ##6 human infection cases and 77 ##4 deaths . a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed corona ##virus , named sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was later identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s . subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets , with masked palm ci ##vet ##s considered the most prominent and important carrier . large - scale cu ##lling of ci ##vet ##s appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreak ##s in the region . subsequent ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies showed that ci ##vet ##s are intermediate host of sar ##s - co ##v and bats are the likely natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v and a large number of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##vs ) . detailed analysis of the massive sar ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequence data indicated that sar ##s - co ##v experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission from animals to humans . the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v plays a key role in virus – host interaction and hence is a key deter ##mina ##nt of inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission . it has been shown that minor changes of amino acid ( aa ) residues in the s protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus su ##sc ##ept ##ibility in animal and human hosts . this chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of sar ##s - co ##vs and sl - co ##vs in humans , ci ##vet ##s , and bats . the events of sar ##s outbreak ##s and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broad ##en the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals .  
the emergence rate of novel viruses , such as the corona ##virus that sparked sar ##s , could well be on the rise . researchers now think that the sar ##s virus split from group 2 corona ##virus ##es , and that this happened relatively recently on the scale of corona ##virus evolution .  
abstract various semi ##sy ##nt ##hetic derivatives of g ##ly ##cope ##pt ##ide antibiotics including van ##com ##y ##cin , er ##em ##omy ##cin , te ##ico ##pl ##ani ##n , ri ##sto ##ce ##tin a and da - 40 ##9 ##26 have been evaluated for their inhibitor ##y activity against fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ( fi ##p ##v ) and human ( sar ##s - co ##v , frankfurt - 1 strain ) corona ##virus in cell culture in comparison with their activity against human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) . several g ##ly ##cope ##pt ##ide derivatives modified with hydro ##phobic sub ##sti ##tu ##ents showed selective anti ##vira ##l activity . for the most active compounds , the 50 % effective concentrations ( ec ##50 ) were in the lower micro ##mo ##lar range . in general , removal of the car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te parts of the molecules did not affect the anti ##vira ##l activity of the compounds . some compounds showed inhibitor ##y activity against both , whereas other compounds proved inhibitor ##y to either , fi ##p ##v or sar ##s - co ##v . there was no close correlation between the ec ##50 values of the g ##ly ##cope ##pt ##ide derivatives for fi ##p ##v or sar ##s - co ##v .  
both severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are zoo ##not ##ic pathogen ##s that crossed the species barriers to in ##fect humans . the mechanism of viral inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission is an important scientific question to be addressed . these corona ##virus ##es contain a surface - located spike ( s ) protein that initiate ##s infection by media ##ting receptor - recognition and membrane fusion and is therefore a key factor in host specific ##ity . in addition , the s protein needs to be cl ##ea ##ved by host pro ##tea ##ses before executing fusion , making these pro ##tea ##ses a second deter ##mina ##nt of corona ##virus inter ##sp ##ec ##ies infection . here , we sum ##mar ##ize the progress made in the past decade in understanding the cross - species transmission of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v by focusing on the features of the s protein , its receptor - binding characteristics , and the cleavage process involved in pri ##ming .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , spread largely via droplets . patients present with rapidly progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure . diagnosis requires the demonstration of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link ##age , clinical profiles , and vi ##rol ##ogical evidence of sar ##s - co ##v infection . treatment of sar ##s is largely an ##ec ##dot ##al . high - dose co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid therapy might be useful for critically ill patients , but previous use of rib ##avi ##rin ( a broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l agent ) was probably not e ##ffi ##ca ##cious . some survivors of sar ##s suffer from ava ##scu ##lar nec ##rosis of hip and knee joints . poor pro ##gno ##stic factors include advanced age , como ##rb ##idi ##ties , and high serum lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase and ne ##ut ##rop ##hil levels .  
since the initial emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , a high incidence rate has been observed in saudi arabia . this suggests that the country is at continuous risk . the epidemic level of mer ##s - co ##v infection was examined in saudi arabia by the susceptible - infectious - recovered ( sir ) model using a bay ##esian approach for estimation of time dependent reproduction number ( r ) across a two - year interval ( may , 2013 - may , 2015 ) in five defined clusters , followed by sensitivity analysis of the most significant clusters . significant mer ##s - co ##v peaks were detected in the period between march and may of each year . moreover , mer ##s - co ##v infection was highlighted in western ( 40 . 8 % ) and central ( 31 . 9 % ) regions , followed by eastern region ( 20 % ) . the temporal - based bay ##esian approach indicated a sub - critical epidemic in all regions in the baseline scenario ( r : 0 . 85 – 0 . 97 ) . however , r potential limit was exceeded in the sensitivity analysis scenario in only central and western regions ( r : 1 . 08 – 1 . 12 ) that denoted epidemic level in those regions . the impact of sporadic cases was found relatively insignificant and pin ##point ##ed to the lack of zoo ##not ##ic influence on mer ##s - co ##v transmission dynamics . the results of current study would be helpful for evaluation of future progression of mer ##s - co ##v infections , better understanding and control interventions .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in the guangdong province of china in late 2002 and spread to 29 countries . by the end of the outbreak in july 2003 , the cdc and who reported 84 ##37 cases with a 9 . 6 % case fatal ##ity rate . the disease was caused by a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . drawing on experience with animal corona ##virus vaccines , several vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in pre - clinical trials . available data suggest that vaccines should be based on the the 180 ##k ##da viral spike protein , s , the only significant neutral ##ization antigen capable of inducing protective immune responses in animals . in the absence of clinical cases of sar ##s , candidate vaccines should be evaluated for efficacy in animal models , and although it is uncertain whether the united states food and drug administration ' s “ animal rule ” would apply to li ##cens ##ure of a sar ##s vaccine , it is important to develop standardized animal models and im ##mun ##ological ass ##ays in preparation for this eventual ##ity . this report sum ##mar ##izes the recommendations from a who technical meeting on animal models and antibody ass ##ays for evaluating candidate sar ##s vaccines held on 25 – 26 august 2005 in south mi ##mm ##s , uk , provides guidance on the use of animal models , and outlines the steps to develop standard re ##age ##nts and ass ##ays for im ##mun ##ological evaluation of candidate sar ##s vaccines .  
abstract although the initial outbreak ##s of the deadly corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were controlled by public health measures , the development of vaccines and anti ##vira ##l agents for sar ##s - co ##v is essential for improving control and treatment of future outbreak ##s . one potential target for sar ##s - co ##v anti ##vira ##l drug development is the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) . this enzyme is an attractive target since it is essential for viral replication , and since there are now a number of high resolution x - ray structures of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro available making structure - based drug - design possible . as a result , sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro has become the focus of numerous drug discovery efforts worldwide , but as a consequence , a variety of different 3 ##cl ##pro expression construct ##s and kinetic ass ##ays have been independently developed making evaluation and comparison between potential inhibitors problematic . here , we review the literature focusing on different sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro expression construct ##s and ass ##ays used to measure en ##zy ##matic activity . moreover , we provide experimental evidence showing that the activity of 3 ##cl ##pro en ##zy ##matic is significantly reduced when non - native sequences or affinity - tags are added to the n - or c - term ##ini of the enzyme , or when the enzyme used in ass ##ays is at concentrations below the equilibrium di ##sso ##ciation constant of the 3 ##cl ##pro dime ##r . we demonstrate for the first time the utility of a highly sensitive and novel alexa ##48 ##8 - q ##sy ##7 fr ##et - based peptide substrate designed for routine analysis and high - through ##put screening , and show that kinetic constant ##s determined from fr ##et - based ass ##ays that are un ##cor ##re ##cted for inner - filter effects can lead to artifacts . finally , we evaluated the effects of common ass ##ay components including dt ##t , na ##cl , ed ##ta and d ##ms ##o on en ##zy ##matic activity , and we recommend standardized ass ##ay conditions and construct ##s for routine sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro ass ##ays to facilitate direct comparisons between sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitors under development worldwide .  
abstract we recently published experimental results that indicated au ##rin ##tric ##ar ##box ##yl ##ic acid ( ata ) could selective ##ly inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication inside host cells by greater than 1000 times . this inhibition suggested that ata could be developed as potent anti - viral drug . here , to extend our experimental observation , we have incorporated protein structural studies ( with positive / negative controls ) to investigate the potential binding modes / sites of ata onto rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) from sar ##s - co ##v and other pathogen ##ic positive - strand rna - viruses , as well as other proteins in sar ##s - co ##v based on the fact that ata binds to ca ##2 + - activated neutral pro ##tea ##se ( m - cal ##pa ##in ) , the protein ty ##ros ##ine ph ##os ##pha ##tase ( pt ##p ) and hiv int ##eg ##rase which have existing crystal structures . eight regions with homo ##log ##ous 3d - conform ##ation were derived for 10 proteins of interest . one of the region , r binding ( 75 ##4 – 76 ##6 in sar ##s - co ##v ' s rd ##rp ) , located in the palm sub - domain mainly constituted of anti - parallel β - strand - turn - β - strand hair ##pin structures that covers two of the three rd ##rp catalytic sites ( as ##p 760 , as ##p ##7 ##6 ##1 ) , was also predicted by molecular docking method ( based on free energy of binding δ ##g ) to be important binding motif recognized by ata . the existence of this strictly conserved region that incorporated catalytic residues , coupled with the homo ##log ##ous ata binding pockets and their consistent δ ##g values , suggested strongly ata may be involved in an analogous inhibition mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v ' s rd ##rp in con ##com ##itan ##t to the case in m - cal ##pa ##in , pt ##p and hiv int ##eg ##rase .  
abstract because outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) might re ##eme ##rge , identifying anti ##vira ##l compounds is of key importance . previously , we showed that the cellular factor tn ##f - α converting enzyme ( ta ##ce ) , activated by the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v ( sar ##s - s protein ) , was positively involved in viral entry , implying that ta ##ce is a possible target for developing anti ##vira ##l compounds . to demonstrate this possibility , we here tested the effects of ta ##ce inhibitors on viral entry . in vitro and in vivo data revealed that the ta ##ce inhibitor tap ##i - 2 at ##ten ##uated entry of both pseudo ##type ##d virus expressing the sar ##s - s protein in a lent ##iv ##ira ##l vector backbone and infectious sar ##s - co ##v . tap ##i - 2 blocked both the sar ##s - s protein - induced shed ##ding of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , a receptor of sar ##s - co ##v , and tn ##f - α production in lung tissues . since the down ##re ##gul ##ation of ace ##2 by sar ##s - s protein was proposed as an et ##iol ##ogical event in the severe clinical manifestation ##s , our data suggest that ta ##ce antagonist ##s block sar ##s - co ##v infection and also at ##ten ##uate its severe clinical outcome .  
abstract human corona ##virus ##es sar ##s - co ##v - 2 appeared at the end of 2019 and led to a pan ##de ##mic with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . as there are currently no effective drugs targeting this virus , drug rep ##ur ##po ##sing represents a short - term strategy to treat millions of infected patients at low costs . hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e showed an anti ##vira ##l effect in vitro . in vivo it showed efficacy , especially when combined with az ##ith ##rom ##y ##cin in a preliminary clinical trial . here we demonstrate that the combination of hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e and az ##ith ##rom ##y ##cin has a syn ##er ##gist ##ic effect in vitro on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung .  
abstract the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; previously provisional ##ly named 2019 novel corona ##virus or 2019 - nc ##ov ) disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and is a major public health issue . as of 11 february 2020 , data from the world health organization ( who ) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries / regions , with > 99 % of cases being detected in china . on 30 january 2020 , the who declared co ##vid - 19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is closely related to two bat - derived severe acute respiratory syndrome - like corona ##virus ##es , bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##c ##45 and bat - sl - co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 . it is spread by human - to - human transmission via droplets or direct contact , and infection has been estimated to have mean inc ##uba ##tion period of 6 . 4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2 . 24 – 3 . 58 . among patients with pneumonia caused by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( novel corona ##virus pneumonia or wu ##han pneumonia ) , fever was the most common sy ##mpt ##om , followed by cough . bilateral lung involvement with ground - glass op ##ac ##ity was the most common finding from computed tom ##ography images of the chest . the one case of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pneumonia in the usa is responding well to re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir , which is now undergoing a clinical trial in china . currently , controlling infection to prevent the spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the primary intervention being used . however , public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely , as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak , the better we can respond .  
summary objectives middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has emerged to cause fatal infections in patients in the middle east and traveler - associated secondary cases in europe and africa . person - to - person transmission is evident in outbreak ##s involving household and hospital contacts . effective anti ##vira ##ls are urgently needed . methods we used small compound - based forward chemical genetics to screen a chemical library of 128 ##0 known drugs against influenza a virus in bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level - 2 laboratory . we then assessed the anti - mer ##s - co ##v activities of the identified compounds and of inter ##fer ##ons , ne ##lf ##ina ##vir , and lo ##pina ##vir because of their reported anti - corona ##virus activities in terms of cy ##top ##athic effect inhibition , viral yield reduction , and plaque reduction ass ##ays in bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level - 3 laboratory . results ten compounds were identified as primary hits in high - through ##put screening . only my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid exhibited low ec ##50 and high select ##ivity index . additionally , rib ##avi ##rin and inter ##fer ##ons also exhibited in - vitro anti - mer ##s - co ##v activity . the serum concentrations ac ##hi ##eva ##ble at therapeutic doses of my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b were 60 – 300 and 3 – 4 times higher than the concentrations at which in - vitro anti - mer ##s - co ##v activities were demonstrated , whereas that of rib ##avi ##rin was [UNK] times lower . combination of my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid and inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b lowered the ec ##50 of each drug by 1 – 3 times . conclusions inter ##fer ##on - β ##1 ##b with my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid should be considered in treatment trials of mer ##s .  
sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the large sar ##s outbreak in 2003 , originated in bats . many sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##vs ) have been detected in bats , particularly those that reside in china , europe , and africa . to further understand the evolutionary relationship between sar ##s - co ##v and its reservoirs , 334 bats were collected from zhou ##shan city , zhejiang province , china , between 2015 and 2017 . pc ##r amp ##li ##fication of the conserved corona ##vira ##l protein rd ##rp detected corona ##virus ##es in 26 . 65 % of bats belonging to this region , and this number was influenced by seasonal changes . full gen ##omic analyses of the two new sl - co ##vs from zhou ##shan ( z ##x ##c ##21 and z ##c ##45 ) showed that their genome ##s were 29 , 73 ##2 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ( nt ) and 29 , 802 nt in length , respectively , with 13 open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . these results revealed 81 % shared nu ##cle ##otide identity with human / ci ##vet sar ##s co ##vs , which was more distant than that observed previously for bat sl - co ##vs in china . importantly , using pathogen ##ic tests , we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suck ##ling rats , and further studies showed that the virus - like particles can be observed in the brains of suck ##ling rats by electron microscopy . thus , this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the sl - co ##vs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross - species transmission of sl - co ##vs using suck ##ling rats as an animal model .  
abstract the only severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) vaccine currently being tested in clinical trial consists of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome - associate corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . however , limited information is available about host immune responses induced by the inactivated sar ##s vaccine . in this study , we demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v inactivated by β - prop ##iol ##act ##one eli ##cite ##d high ti ##ters of antibodies in the im ##mun ##ized mice and rabbits that recognize the spike ( s ) protein , especially the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the s ##1 region . the anti ##ser ##a from the im ##mun ##ized animals efficiently bound to the rb ##d and blocked binding of rb ##d to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , the functional receptor on the susceptible cells for sar ##s - co ##v . with a sensitive and quantitative single - cycle infection ass ##ay using pseudo ##virus bearing the sar ##s - co ##v s protein , we demonstrated that mouse and rabbit anti ##ser ##a significantly inhibit ##ed s protein - mediated virus entry with mean 50 % inhibitor ##y ti ##ters of 1 : 73 ##9 ##3 and 1 : 206 ##0 , respectively . these data suggest that the rb ##d of s protein is a major neutral ##ization deter ##mina ##nt in the inactivated sar ##s vaccine which can induce potent neutral ##izing antibodies to block sar ##s - co ##v entry . however , caution should be taken in using the inactivated sar ##s - co ##v as a vaccine since it may also cause harmful immune and / or inflammatory responses .  
abstract in recent years severe infectious diseases have been constantly emerging , causing panic in the world . now we know that many of these terrible diseases are caused by viruses originated from bats ( table 1 ) , such as e ##bola virus , mar ##burg , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , ni ##pa ##h virus ( ni ##v ) and hen ##dra virus ( he ##v ) . these viruses have co - evolved with bats due to bats ’ special social , biological and im ##mun ##ological features . although bats are not in close contact with humans , spill ##over of viruses from bats to intermediate animal hosts , such as horses , pigs , ci ##vet ##s , or non - human primate ##s , is thought to be the most likely mode to cause human infection . humans may also become infected with viruses through aero ##sol by int ##rud ##ing into bat ro ##ost ##ing caves or via direct contact with bats , such as catching bats or been bitten by bats .  
the published data , which showed the co ##vid - 19 patients with low digest ##ive ? manifestation , might be misleading . case with negative ur ##t test showed positive in ? rec ##tal scar ##ab which challenge the isolation protocol . ? as f ##omi ##te transmission caused clusters of infection of sar ##s , adequate di ##sin ##fect ##ion ? operations should be adopted in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak .  
emerging and re - emerging pathogen ##s represent a substantial threat to public health , as demonstrated with numerous outbreak ##s over the past years , including the 2013 – 2016 outbreak of e ##bola virus in western africa . corona ##virus ##es are also a threat for humans , as evidenced in 2002 / 2003 with infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which caused more than 800 ##0 human infections with 10 % fatal ##ity rate in 37 countries . ten years later , a novel human corona ##virus ( middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , mer ##s - co ##v ) , associated with severe pneumonia , arose in the kingdom of saudi arabia . until december 2016 , mer ##s has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35 % fatal ##ity rate . finding an animal model of disease is key to develop vaccines or anti ##vira ##ls against such emerging pathogen ##s and to understand its pathogen ##esis . knowledge of the potential role of domestic livestock and other animal species in the transmission of pathogen ##s is of importance to understand the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the disease . little is known about mer ##s - co ##v animal host range . in this paper , experimental data on potential hosts for mer ##s - co ##v is reviewed . advantages and limitations of different animal models are evaluated in relation to viral pathogen ##esis and transmission studies . finally , the relevance of potential new target species is discussed .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently discovered viral disease , characterized by fever , cough , acute fi ##bri ##nous pneumonia and high in ##fect ##ivity . specific pathogen - free ( sp ##f ) chickens were im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s corona ##virus and their eggs were harvested at regular intervals . yo ##lk im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( i ##gy ) was extracted using the water dil ##ution method , followed by further purification on a sep ##had ##ex g - 75 column . sd ##s - poly ##ac ##ryl ##ami ##de gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is ( sd ##s - page ) , western b ##lot and neutral ##ization test results showed that the i ##gy obtained was of a high purity and had a strong reactive activity with a neutral ##ization ti ##ter of 1 : 640 . l ##yo ##phi ##lization and stability tests showed that l ##yo ##phi ##lized anti - sar ##s corona ##virus i ##gy had promising physical properties , with no significant reduction in reactive activity and good thermal stability . all these data suggest that the anti - sar ##s corona ##virus i ##gy could be a new useful biological product for specific anti ##vira ##l therapy against sar ##s .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) still carries the potential for re ##eme ##rgen ##ce , therefore efforts are being made to create a vaccine as a prop ##hyl ##actic strategy for control and prevention . antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) is a mechanism through which deng ##ue viruses , fe ##line corona ##virus ##es , and hiv viruses take advantage of anti - viral humor ##al immune responses to in ##fect host target cells . here we describe our observations of sar ##s - co ##v using ad ##e to enhance the in ##fect ##ivity of a h ##l - c ##z human promo ##no ##cy ##te cell line . quantitative - pc ##r and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence stain ##ing results indicate that sar ##s - co ##v is capable of replication in h ##l - c ##z cells , and of displaying virus - induced cy ##top ##athic effects and increased levels of tn ##f - α , il - 4 and il - 6 two days post - infection . according to flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry data , the h ##l - c ##z cells also expressed ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 , a sar ##s - co ##v receptor ) and higher levels of the fc ##γ ##ri ##i receptor . we found that higher concentrations of anti - sera against sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v infection , while highly dil ##uted anti - sera significantly increased sar ##s - co ##v infection and induced higher levels of ap ##op ##tosis . results from in ##fect ##ivity ass ##ays indicate that sar ##s - co ##v ad ##e is primarily mediated by dil ##uted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins . we also generated mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted sar ##s - co ##v infection . combined , our results suggest that antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v spike proteins may trigger ad ##e effects . the data raise new questions regarding a potential sar ##s - co ##v vaccine , while shed ##ding light on mechanisms involved in sar ##s pathogen ##esis .  
abstract the lethal corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and most recently middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are serious human health hazard . a successful viral infection requires fusion between virus and host cells carried out by the surface spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein or s protein of co ##v . current models propose that the s ##2 subunit of s protein assembled into a he ##xa ##meric he ##lica ##l bundle exposing hydro ##phobic fu ##so ##genic peptide ##s or fusion peptide ##s ( f ##ps ) for membrane insertion . the n - terminus of s ##2 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v reported to be active in cell fusion whereby f ##ps have been identified . atomic - resolution structure of f ##ps derived either in model membranes or in membrane mimic environment would g ##lean insights toward viral cell fusion mechanism . here , we have solved 3d structure , dynamics and mice ##lle local ##ization of a 64 - residue long fusion peptide or l ##fp in d ##pc deter ##gent mice ##lles by nm ##r methods . mice ##lle bound structure of l ##fp is el ##uc ##ida ##ted by the presence of discrete ##ly folded he ##lica ##l and intervening loops . the c - terminus region , residues f ##42 - y ##6 ##2 , displays a long hydro ##phobic helix , whereas the n - terminus is defined by a short amp ##hip ##athic helix , residues r ##4 - q ##12 . the intervening residues of l ##fp assume stretches of loops and he ##lica ##l turns . the n - terminal helix is sustained by close aromatic and ali ##pha ##tic side ##chai ##n packing interactions at the non - polar face . 15 ##n { 1 ##h } no ##e studies indicated dynamic ##al motion , at ps - ns times ##cal ##e , of the he ##lices of l ##fp in d ##pc mice ##lles . pre nm ##r showed that insertion of several regions of l ##fp into d ##pc mice ##lle core . together , the current study provides insights toward fusion mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v .  
background transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) among health care workers ( hc ##ws ) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approx ##imating 36 % . we propose advanced infection control measures ( a - ic ) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures ( b - ic ) help reduce pathogen transmission . b - ic include standard and transmission - based precautions . a - ic are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of b - ic . objective study effectiveness of combining b - ic and a - ic to prevent transmission of mer ##s - co ##v to hc ##ws . methods a retrospective observation ##al study was undertaken . a - ic measures include administrative support with daily rounds ; infection control risk assessment ; timely screening , isolation , and specimen analysis ; collaboration ; epidemic planning ; stock ##pi ##ling ; implementation of con ##ting ##ency plans ; full personal protective equipment use for advanced air ##way management ; use of a real - time electronic isolation flag ##ging system ; infection prevention and control team on - call protocols ; pre ##tra ##ns ##fer mer ##s - co ##v testing ; and education . results a total of 87 ##4 real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction mer ##s - co ##v tests were performed during the period beginning july 1 , 2013 , and ending january 31 , 2015 . six hundred ninety - four non - hc ##ws were tested , of these 16 tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v and their infection was community acquired . sixty - nine percent of the confirmed mer ##s - co ##v - positive cases were men , with an average age of 56 years ( range , 19 - 84 years ) . of the total tested for mer ##s - co ##v , 180 individuals were hc ##ws with zero po ##sit ##ivity . conclusions ad ##hering to a combination of b - ic and a - ic reduces the risk of mer ##s - co ##v transmission to hc ##ws .

enveloped viruses have evolved membrane g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( gps ) that media ##te entry into host cells . these proteins are important targets for anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies and vaccines . several efforts to understand and combat infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) have therefore focused on the viral gp , known as spike ( s ) . in a short period of time , important aspects of sar ##s - co ##v s - protein function were un ##rave ##led . the identification of ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) as a receptor for sar ##s - co ##v provided an insight into viral tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##esis , whereas mapping of functional domains in the s - protein enabled inhibitors to be generated . vaccines designed on the basis of sar ##s - co ##v s - protein were shown to be effective in animals and consequently are attractive candidates for vaccine trials in humans . here , we discuss how sar ##s - co ##v s facilitates viral entry into target cells and illustrate current approaches that are used to inhibit this process .  
the sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network sub ##sum ##ing most of the traditional rival ##ries in the competitive field of vi ##rol ##ogy . within months of the sar ##s outbreak , collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . however , although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough , our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited . detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective counter ##me ##as ##ures , diagnostic tests , vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs against the sar ##s - co ##v . this article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about sar ##s - co ##v , from the aspects of comparative gen ##omics , molecular biology of viral genes , evolution , and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti - viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information .  
in early december 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in wu ##han , a city of 11 million persons in the people ’ s republic of china . further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified corona ##virus , initially termed 2019 - nc ##ov and subsequently sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the infection moved rapidly through china , spread to thailand and japan , extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air , eventually reaching multiple countries and continents . similar to such other corona ##virus ##es as those causing the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , the new corona ##virus was reported to spread via natural aero ##sol ##s from human - to - human . in the early stages of this epidemic the case fatal ##ity rate is estimated to be approximately 2 % , with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations . unfortunately , there is limited experience with corona ##virus infections during pregnancy , and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019 - nc ##ov epidemic . in order to assess the potential of the wu ##han 2019 - nc ##ov to cause maternal , fetal and neon ##atal mor ##bid ##ity and other poor ob ##ste ##tric ##al outcomes , this communication reviews the published data addressing the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical effects of sar ##s , mer ##s , and other corona ##virus infections on pregnant women and their infants . recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design , clinical trials , and implementation of future 2019 - nc ##ov vaccines .  
abstract to date , the world perhaps has never waited for the summer so impatiently in the entire ant ##hr ##op ##ocene , owing to the debate whether increasing temperature and humidity will decrease the environmental endurance of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we present the perspective on the seasonal change on sar ##s - co ##v - 2 decay and co ##vid - 19 spread . our arguments are based on : i ) structural similarity of corona ##virus with several enter ##ic viruses , and its vulnerability ; ii ) reports related to decay of those similar trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis viruses ( t ##ge ##v ) like nor ##ov ##irus and iii ) improvement in the human immunity during summer compared to winter . we present reasons why we can be optimistic about the slow ##down of corona in the upcoming summer .  
summary middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged into the human population in 2012 and has caused substantial mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . potent ##ly neutral ##izing antibodies targeting the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) on mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein have been characterized , but much less is known about antibodies targeting non - rb ##d ep ##ito ##pes . here , we report the structural and functional characterization of g ##2 , a neutral ##izing antibody targeting the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 n - terminal domain ( s ##1 - nt ##d ) . structures of g ##2 alone and in complex with the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 - nt ##d define a site of vulnerability comprising two loops , each of which contain a residue mu ##tated in g ##2 - escape variants . cell - surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrate that g ##2 strongly disrupt ##s the attachment of mer ##s - co ##v s to its receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e - 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , with the inhibition requiring the native trim ##eric s conform ##ation . these results advance our understanding of antibody - mediated neutral ##ization of corona ##virus ##es and should facilitate the development of im ##mun ##oth ##era ##pe ##uti ##cs and vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , a type i trans ##me ##mb ##rane envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , consists of s ##1 and s ##2 domains responsible for virus binding and fusion , respectively . the s ##1 contains a receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) that can specifically bind to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the receptor on target cells . here we show that a rec ##om ##bina ##nt fusion protein ( designated rb ##d - fc ) containing 193 - amino acid rb ##d ( residues 318 – 510 ) and a human i ##gg ##1 fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in the im ##mun ##ized rabbits . the antibodies recognized rb ##d on s ##1 domain and completely inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v infection at a serum dil ##ution of 1 : 10 , 240 . rabbit anti ##ser ##a effectively blocked binding of s ##1 , which contains rb ##d , to ace ##2 . this suggests that rb ##d can induce highly potent neutral ##izing antibody responses and has potential to be developed as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for prevention of sar ##s .  
abstract vaccine - induced antibodies can prevent or , in the case of fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus , ag ##gra ##vate infections by corona ##virus ##es . we investigated whether a rec ##om ##bina ##nt native full - length s - protein trim ##er ( tri ##sp ##ike ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was able to eli ##cit a neutral ##izing and protective immune response in animals and analyzed the capacity of anti - s antibodies to media ##te antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) of virus entry in vitro and enhancement of replication in vivo . sar ##s - co ##v - specific serum and mu ##cos ##al im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins were readily detected in im ##mun ##ized animals . serum i ##gg blocked binding of the s - protein to the ace ##2 receptor and neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v infection in vitro . entry into human b cell lines occurred in a fc ##γ ##ri ##i - dependent and ace ##2 - independent fashion indicating that ad ##e of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v . va ##cci ##nated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was und ##ete ##ctable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with sar ##s - co ##v . altogether our results indicate that a rec ##om ##bina ##nt trim ##eric s protein was able to eli ##cit an e ##ffi ##ca ##cious protective immune response in vivo and warrant concern in the safety evaluation of a human vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged as the causal agent of an endemic at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , in ##fect ##ing thousands of people worldwide . although a number of promising potential vaccines and therapeutic agents for sar ##s - co ##v have been described , no effective anti ##vira ##l drug against sar ##s - co ##v is currently available . the intricate , sequential nature of the viral entry process provides multiple valid targets for drug development . here , we describe a rapid and safe cell - based high - through ##put screening system , dual envelope pseudo ##vir ##ion ( de ##p ) ass ##ay , for specifically screening inhibitors of viral entry . the ass ##ay system employs a novel dual envelope strategy , using lent ##iv ##ira ##l pseudo ##vir ##ions as targets whose entry is driven by the sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . a second , unrelated viral envelope is used as an internal control to reduce the number of false positive ##s . as an example of the power of this ass ##ay a class of inhibitors is reported with the potential to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v at two steps of the replication cycle , viral entry and particle assembly . this ass ##ay system can be easily adapted to screen entry inhibitors against other viruses with the careful selection of matching partner virus envelope ##s .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . there are many point mutations among sar ##s - co ##v genome sequences . previous studies suggested that the mutations are correlated closely with the sar ##s epidemic . it was found that the bases of six nu ##cle ##otide positions ( nt ##9 ##40 ##4 , nt ##9 ##47 ##9 , nt ##19 ##8 ##38 , nt ##21 ##7 ##21 , nt ##22 ##22 ##2 and nt ##27 ##8 ##27 ) with high - mutation rate have an important relationship with the sar ##s epidemic . for viral detection as well as gen ##ot ##yp ##ing , a universal micro ##ar ##ray system was developed that combines rt - pc ##r and liga ##se detection reaction ( ld ##r ) . the zip codes attached co ##valent ##ly to a slide remain constant and their complementary zip codes ( c ##zi ##p codes ) can be used for tag ##ging target sequence , making the micro ##ar ##ray ##s universal . the disc ##rim ##inating ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide ##s contain on the 5 ′ end “ c ##zi ##p codes ” that are used to direct ld ##r product to specific zip codes attached co ##valent ##ly to a slide . since zip codes have no homo ##logy to either the target sequence or to other sequences in the genome ##s of both human host and sar ##s - co ##v , there was no false signal due to mis ##mat ##ch hybrid ##izations . 20 samples ass ##ay ##ed with the universal micro ##ar ##ray were confirmed by dna sequencing , demonstrating that this micro ##ar ##ray system is a promising diagnostic tool for detection and gen ##ot ##yp ##ing of the sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the transcription and replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is regulated by specific viral genome sequences within 5 ′ - and 3 ′ - un ##tra ##ns ##lated regions ( 5 ′ - ut ##r and 3 ′ - ut ##r ) . here we report the solution structure of 5 ′ - ut ##r derived stem - loop 2 ( sl ##2 ) of sar ##s - co ##v determined by nm ##r spectroscopy . the highly conserved pen ##tal ##oop of sl ##2 is stacked on 5 - bp stem and adopt ##s a canonical cu ##y ##g te ##tral ##oop fold with the 3 ′ nu ##cle ##otide ( u ##51 ) flipped out of the stack . the significance of this structure in the context of a previous mu ##tage ##nes ##is analysis of sl ##2 function in replication of the related group 2 corona ##virus , mouse hepatitis virus , is discussed .  
abstract the multi - domain non - structural protein 3 ( ns ##p ##3 ) is the largest protein encoded by the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) genome , with an average molecular mass of about 200 k ##d . ns ##p ##3 is an essential component of the replication / transcription complex . it comprises various domains , the organization of which differs between co ##v genera , due to du ##plication or absence of some domains . however , eight domains of ns ##p ##3 exist in all known co ##vs : the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like domain 1 ( u ##bl ##1 ) , the g ##lu - rich acidic domain ( also called “ hyper ##var ##iable region ” ) , a macro ##dom ##ain ( also named “ x domain ” ) , the u ##bi ##qui ##tin - like domain 2 ( u ##bl ##2 ) , the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se 2 ( pl ##2 ##pro ) , the ns ##p ##3 ec ##to ##dom ##ain ( 3 ##ect ##o , also called “ zinc - finger domain ” ) , as well as the domains y ##1 and co ##v - y of unknown functions . in addition , the two trans ##me ##mb ##rane regions , t ##m ##1 and t ##m ##2 , exist in all co ##vs . the three - dimensional structures of domains in the n - terminal two thirds of ns ##p ##3 have been investigated by x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy and / or nuclear magnetic resonance ( nm ##r ) spectroscopy since the outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2003 as well as middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 . in this review , the structures and functions of these domains of ns ##p ##3 are discussed in depth .  
super - spreading occurs when a single patient in ##fect ##s a di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate number of contacts . the 2015 mer ##s - co ##v , 2003 sar ##s - co ##v , and to a lesser extent 2014 – 15 e ##bola virus outbreak ##s were driven by super - spread ##ers . we sum ##mar ##ize documented super - spreading in these outbreak ##s , explore contributing factors , and suggest studies to better understand super - spreading .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , isolated from humans infected during the peak of epidemic , en ##codes two accessory proteins termed as 8 ##a and 8 ##b . interesting ##ly , the sar ##s - co ##v isolated from animals contains an extra 29 - nu ##cle ##otide in this region such that these proteins are fused to become a single protein , 8 ##ab . here , we compared the cellular properties of the 8 ##a , 8 ##b and 8 ##ab proteins by examining their cellular local ##izations and their abilities to interact with other sar ##s - co ##v proteins . these results may suggest that the conform ##ations of 8 ##a and 8 ##b are different from 8 ##ab although nearly all the amino acids in 8 ##a and 8 ##b are found in 8 ##ab . in addition , the expression of the structural protein , envelope ( e ) , was down - regulated by 8 ##b but not 8 ##a or 8 ##ab . consequently , e was not detect ##able in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells that were expressing high levels of 8 ##b . these findings suggest that 8 ##b may mod ##ulate viral replication and / or pathogen ##esis .  
abstract background the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) gene of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been useful in analyzing the molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the 2003 sar ##s outbreak ##s . objectives to character ##ize complete sar ##s - co ##v s - gene sequences from hong kong . study design fifty - six sar ##s - co ##v s - gene sequences , obtained from patients who presented with sar ##s to the prince of wales hospital during march – may 2003 , were anal ##yse ##d using a maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach , together with 138 other ( both human and animal ) s - gene sequences downloaded from gen ##bank . results the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) trees showed little evolution occurring within these 56 sequences . analysis with the other sequences , showed three distinct sar ##s clusters , closely correlated to previously defined early , middle and late phases of the 2003 international sar ##s outbreak ##s . in addition , two new single nu ##cle ##otide variations ( s ##n ##vs ) , t ##21 ##6 ##15 ##a and t ##21 ##90 ##1 ##a , were discovered , not previously reported elsewhere . conclusions the ml approach to the reconstruction of tree ph ##yl ##ogen ##ies is known to be superior to the more popular , less computational ##ly and time - demanding neighbour - joining ( nj ) approach . the ml analysis in this study confirms the previously reported sar ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ology anal ##yse ##d mostly using the nj approach . the two new s ##n ##vs reported here are most likely due to the tissue - culture pass ##aging of the clinical samples .  
the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 epidemic started in late december 2019 in wu ##han , china , and has since impacted a large portion of china and raised major global concern . here ##in , we investigated the extent of molecular diver ##gence between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other related corona ##virus ##es . although we found only 4 % variability in gen ##omic nu ##cle ##otide ##s between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and a bat sar ##s - related corona ##virus ( sar ##sr - co ##v ; rat ##g ##13 ) , the difference at neutral sites was 17 % , suggesting the diver ##gence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated . our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike seen in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and viruses from pang ##olin sar ##sr - co ##vs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides rec ##om ##bina ##tion . population genetic analyses of 103 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genome ##s indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types ( designated l and s ) , that are well defined by two different s ##np ##s that show nearly complete link ##age across the viral strains sequence ##d to date . although the l type ( [UNK] % ) is more prevalent than the s type ( [UNK] % ) , the s type was found to be the ancestral version . whereas the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wu ##han , the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 . human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type , which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly . on the other hand , the s type , which is evolution ##ari ##ly older and less aggressive , might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure . these findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate , comprehensive studies that combine gen ##omic data , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data , and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the binding of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein to cellular ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the first step in sar ##s - co ##v infection . therefore , we ass ##ay ##ed the inhibitor ##y effects of small peptide ##s derived from s protein on the binding of s protein to ace ##2 and on the s - protein - pseudo ##type ##d retro ##virus in ##fect ##ivity . sp - 4 ( residues 192 – 203 ) , sp - 8 ( residues 48 ##3 – 49 ##4 ) , and sp - 10 ( residues 66 ##8 – 67 ##9 ) significantly blocked the interaction between s protein and ace ##2 by bio ##tin ##yla ##ted enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay , with ic ##50 values of 4 . 30 ##± ##2 . 18 , 6 . 99 ##± ##0 . 71 , and 1 . 88 ##± ##0 . 52 ##n ##mo ##l , respectively . peptide scanning suggested the region spanning residues 660 – 68 ##3 might act as a receptor - binding domain . sp - 10 blocked both binding of the s protein and in ##fect ##ivity of s protein - pseudo ##type ##d retro ##virus to ve ##ro e ##6 cells . in conclusion , this is the first report of small peptide ##s designed to disrupt the binding of sar ##s - co ##v s protein to ace ##2 . our findings suggest that sp - 10 may be developed as an anti - sar ##s - co ##v agent for the treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract a severe viral illness caused by a newly discovered corona ##virus was first reported in the middle east in 2012 . the virus has since been named the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . mer ##s - co ##v cases have been reported in several countries around the world in travelers from the middle east . the illness has a high mortality rate . limited human - to - human transmission has occurred including transmission to health care workers . the source of the virus remains unclear , but camel ##s are a possible source . two unrelated imported cases of mer ##s - co ##v have been reported in the united states . neither a vaccine nor effective therapy against the virus is available . international cooperation and information sharing will be key to understanding and ending the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak .  
summary effective anti ##vira ##l agents are needed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection . we assessed the anti ##vira ##l potential of rec ##om ##bina ##nt inter ##fer ##ons against two clinical isolate ##s of sar ##s - co ##v — ff ##m - 1 , from frankfurt patients , and hong kong — replicate ##d in ve ##ro and ca ##co ##2 cells . inter ##fer ##on β was five to ten times more effective in ca ##co ##2 cells . inter ##fer ##on α effectively inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication , but with a select ##ivity index 50 – 90 times lower than that for inter ##fer ##on β . inter ##fer ##on γ was slightly better than inter ##fer ##on α in ve ##ro cell cultures , but was completely ineffective in ca ##co ##2 cell cultures . inter ##fer ##on β could be useful alone or in combination with other anti ##vira ##l drugs for the treatment of sar ##s .  
abstract eu ##kar ##yo ##tic cellular and most viral rna ##s carry a 5 ′ - terminal cap structure , a 5 ′ - 5 ′ trip ##hos ##phate link ##age between the 5 ′ end of the rna and a gu ##ano ##sin ##e nu ##cle ##otide ( cap - 0 ) . sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein ns ##p ##16 functions as a methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se , to methyl ##ate mrna cap - 0 structure at the rib ##ose 2 ′ - o position of the first nu ##cle ##otide to form cap - 1 structures . however , whether there is inter ##play between ns ##p ##16 and host proteins was not yet clear . in this report , we identified several potential cellular ns ##p ##16 - interacting proteins from a human thy ##mus cd ##na library by yeast two - hybrid screening . v ##hl , one of these proteins , was proven to interact with ns ##p ##16 both in vitro and in vivo . further studies showed that v ##hl can inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication by regulating ns ##p ##16 u ##bi ##qui ##tina ##tion and promoting its degradation . our results have revealed the role of cellular v ##hl in the regulation of sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
abstract background the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) virus is a member of the corona ##vir ##idae ( co ##v ) family that first appeared in the guangdong province of china in 2002 and was recognized as an emerging infectious disease in march 2003 . over 800 ##0 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic . we report the safety and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of a sar ##s dna vaccine in a phase i human study . methods a single - pl ##as ##mi ##d dna vaccine encoding the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults . nine subjects completed the 3 dose va ##cci ##nation schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses . immune response was assessed by intra ##cellular cy ##tok ##ine stain ##ing ( ic ##s ) , eli ##sp ##ot , elisa , and neutral ##ization ass ##ays . results the vaccine was well tolerated . sar ##s - co ##v - specific antibody was detected by elisa in 8 of 10 subjects and neutral ##izing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine . sar ##s - co ##v - specific cd ##4 + t - cell responses were detected in all vaccine ##es , and cd ##8 + t - cell responses in [UNK] % of individuals . conclusions the vr ##c sar ##s dna vaccine was well tolerated and produced cellular immune responses and neutral ##izing antibody in healthy adults .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . corona ##virus ##es including sar ##s - co ##v en ##code an envelope ( e ) protein , a small , hydro ##phobic membrane protein . we report that , in plan ##ar lip ##id bi ##layer ##s , synthetic peptide ##s corresponding to the sar ##s - co ##v e protein forms ion channels that are more per ##me ##able to mono ##valent cat ##ions than to mono ##valent an ##ions . affinity - pu ##rified poly ##cl ##onal antibodies recognizing the n - terminal 19 residues of sar ##s - co ##v e protein were used to establish the specific ##ity of channel formation by inhibit ##ing the ion currents generated in the presence of the e protein peptide ##s .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerging infectious disease . the potential rec ##ur ##rence of the disease from animal reservoirs highlights the significance of development of safe and efficient vaccines to prevent a future sar ##s epidemic . in this study , we expressed the rec ##om ##bina ##nt receptor - binding domain ( rr ##b ##d ) in mammalian ( 293 ##t ) cells , insect ( sf ##9 ) cells , and e . coli , respectively , and compared their im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protection against sar ##s - co ##v infection in an established mouse model . our results show that all rr ##b ##d proteins expressed in the above systems maintained intact conform ##ation , being able to induce highly potent neutral ##izing antibody responses and complete protective immunity against sar ##s - co ##v challenge in mice , albeit the rr ##b ##d expressed in 293 ##t cells eli ##cite ##d stronger humor ##al immune responses with significantly higher neutral ##izing activity ( p < 0 . 05 ) than those expressed in sf ##9 and e . coli cells . these results suggest that all three rr ##b ##ds are effective in eli ##cit ##ing immune responses and protection against sar ##s - co ##v and any of the above expression systems can be used for production of rr ##b ##d - based sar ##s subunit vaccines . preference will be given to rr ##b ##d expressed in mammalian cells for future evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in a non - human primate model of sar ##s because of its ability to ref ##old into a native conform ##ation more readily and to induce higher level of neutral ##izing antibody responses than those expressed in e . coli and insect cells .  
middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) resembles a severe form of community - acquired pneumonia initially reported in saudi arabia in 2012 . the mer ##s - co ##v epidemic poses a big challenge because of its high mortality . in january 2015 , a patient who was potentially inc ##uba ##ting mer ##s - co ##v arrived from the emergency department of another hospital and was admitted with acute corona ##ry syndrome . this resulted in an outbreak in the cardiac surgery ward that caused the deaths of 5 of 6 patients who had undergone cardiac operations .  
abstract infection of conventional mice with a mouse adapted ( ma ##15 ) severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) reproduce ##s many aspects of human sar ##s such as path ##ological changes in lung , vi ##rem ##ia , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia , and lethal ##ity . however , established mouse cell lines highly susceptible to mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v infection are not available . in this work , efficiently trans ##fect ##able mouse cell lines stab ##ly expressing the mu ##rine sar ##s - co ##v receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) have been generated . these cells yielded high sar ##s - co ##v - ma ##15 ti ##ters and also served as excellent tools for plaque ass ##ays . in addition , in these cell lines , sar ##s - co ##v - ma ##15 induced the expression of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and if ##n - β , mimic ##king what has been observed in experimental animal models infected with sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s patients . these cell lines are valuable tools to perform in vitro studies in a mouse cell system that reflects the species used for in vivo studies of sar ##s - co ##v - ma ##15 pathogen ##esis .  
abstract it is believed today that nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v is one of the most promising antigen candidates for vaccine design . in this study , three fragments [ n ##1 ( residues : 1 – 422 ) ; n ##2 ( residues : 1 – 109 ) ; n ##3 ( residues : 110 – 422 ) ] of n protein of sar ##s - co ##v were expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and analyzed by poole ##d sera of con ##vale ##sc ##ence phase of sar ##s patients . three gene fragments [ n ##1 ( 1 – 126 ##9 nt ) , n ##2 ( 1 – 327 nt ) and n ##3 ( 328 – 126 ##9 nt ) — expressing the same proteins of n ##1 , n ##2 and n ##3 , respectively ] of sar ##s - n were clone ##d into pv ##ax - 1 and used to im ##mun ##ize bal ##b / c mice by electro ##por ##ation . humor ##al ( by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay , elisa ) and cellular ( by cell proliferation and cd ##4 + : cd ##8 + ass ##ay ) immunity was detected by using rec ##om ##bina ##nt n ##1 and n ##3 specific antigen . results showed that n ##1 and n ##3 fragments of n protein expressed by e . coli were able to react with sera of sar ##s patients but n ##2 could not . specific humor ##al and cellular immunity in mice could be induced significantly by in ##oc ##ulating sar ##s - co ##v n ##1 and n ##3 dna vaccine . in addition , the immune response levels in n ##3 were significantly higher for antibody responses ( i ##gg and i ##gg ##1 but not i ##gg ##2 ##a ) and cell proliferation but not in cd ##4 + : cd ##8 + ass ##ay compared to n ##1 vaccine . the identification of antigen ##ic n protein fragments has implications to provide basic information for the design of dna vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v . the present results not only suggest that dna im ##mun ##ization with pv ##ax - n ##3 could be used as potential dna va ##cci ##nation approaches to induce antibody in bal ##b / c mice , but also illustrates that gene im ##mun ##ization with these sar ##s dna vaccines can generate different immune responses .  
abstract a novel corona ##virus has been identified as an et ##iol ##ogical agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . to rapidly identify anti - sar ##s drugs available for clinical use , we screened a set of compounds that included anti ##vira ##l drugs already in wide use . here we report that the hiv - 1 pro ##tea ##se inhibitor , ne ##lf ##ina ##vir , strongly inhibit ##ed replication of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . ne ##lf ##ina ##vir inhibit ##ed the cy ##top ##athic effect induced by sar ##s - co ##v infection . expression of viral antigen ##s was much lower in infected cells treated with ne ##lf ##ina ##vir than in un ##tre ##ated infected cells . quantitative rt - pc ##r analysis showed that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir could decrease the production of vi ##rion ##s from ve ##ro cells . experiments with various timing ##s of drug addition revealed that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir ex ##erted its effect not at the entry step , but at the post - entry step of sar ##s - co ##v infection . our results suggest that ne ##lf ##ina ##vir should be examined clinical ##ly for the treatment of sar ##s and has potential as a good lead compound for designing anti - sar ##s drugs .  
abstract the world is faced with a remarkable corona ##virus outbreak with epic ##ent ##re in wu ##han , china . altogether 405 ##54 cases have been confirmed globally with novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) until february 10 , 2020 . rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak , but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial . most initial cases had visited hua ##nan south seafood market in wu ##han selling also various exotic live animals . based on the limited initial human - to - human transmission and timely cluster ##ing of cases in hua ##nan market among elderly men , coupled with knowledge that corona ##virus ##es are derived from animals and relationship of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 to bat corona ##virus , zoo ##not ##ic transmission in the first instance is probable . to target the actions , similar ep ##ide ##mi ##ological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposure ##s . according to current information , an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak . seafood tanks , air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities , but sold animals normally come from various sources . the mode of transmission may become clearer in future : usually in outbreak investigations , hind ##sight is easy , but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) cause common cold ##s in humans , but are also responsible for the recent severe acute , and middle east , respiratory syndrome ##s ( sar ##s and mer ##s , respectively ) . a promising approach for prevention are live at ##ten ##uated vaccines ( la ##vs ) , some of which target the envelope ( e ) protein , which is a small membrane protein that forms ion channels . unfortunately , detailed structural information is still limited for sar ##s - co ##v e , and non - existent for other co ##v e proteins . here ##in , we report a structural model of a sar ##s - co ##v e construct in l ##mp ##g mice ##lles with , for the first time , une ##qui ##vo ##cal inter ##mo ##le ##cular no ##es . the model corresponding to the deter ##gent - embedded region is consistent with previously obtained orientation ##al restraints obtained in lip ##id bi ##layer ##s and in vivo escape mutants . the c - terminal domain is mostly α - he ##lica ##l , and extra ##me ##mb ##rane inter ##mo ##le ##cular no ##es suggest interactions that may affect the t ##m channel conform ##ation .  
abstract background in 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally . we aim to assess im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protective efficacy of pu ##rified inactivated ve ##ro - cell sar ##s vaccine in monkeys . methods the cultures of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) b ##j - 01 strain infected ve ##ro cells were inactivated with β - prop ##iol ##act ##one . sequential procedures , including ultra ##filtration , gel fi ##lt ##ration and ion exchange ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy , were performed to obtain pu ##rified inactivated sar ##s vaccine . the pu ##rified sar ##s vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope , hp ##lc and western b ##lot ##ting . we im ##mun ##ized three groups of cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues fa ##sc ##icular ##is with ad ##ju ##vant - containing pu ##rified vaccine , pu ##rified vaccine and un ##puri ##fied vaccine , respectively , and a fourth group served as a control . antibody ti ##ters were measured by plaque reduction neutral ##ization test . the va ##cci ##nated monkeys were challenged with sar ##s - co ##v b ##j - 01 strain to observe protective efficacy . additionally , three groups of r ##hes ##us monkeys were im ##mun ##ized with different doses of the pu ##rified inactivated sar ##s vaccine ( 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 ##μ ##g / time / monkey ) on days 0 and 7 , and the monkeys were challenged with sar ##s - co ##v g ##z - 01 strain . we assessed the safety of the sar ##s vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) occurred under low levels of neutral ##izing antibody in r ##hes ##us . findings the purity of sar ##s vaccine was 97 . 6 % by hp ##lc identification and reacted with con ##vale ##scent sera of sar ##s patients . the pu ##rified sar ##s vaccine induced high levels of neutral ##izing antibodies and prevented the replication of sar ##s - co ##v in monkeys . under low levels of neutral ##izing antibody , no ex ##ace ##rba ##tion of clinical symptoms was observed when the im ##mun ##ized monkeys were challenged with sar ##s - co ##v . in this preliminary animal trial , no side effects were detected when monkeys were im ##mun ##ized with pu ##rified sar ##s vaccine either at normal or large doses . interpretation the pu ##rified inactivated sar ##s vaccine could induce high levels of neutral ##izing antibody , and protect the monkeys from the challenge of sar ##s - co ##v . the sar ##s vaccine prepared in the study appeared to be safe in monkeys .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infected more than 8 , 000 people across 29 countries and caused more than 900 fatalities . based on the concept of chemical genetics , we screened 50 , 240 structurally diverse small molecules from which we identified 104 compounds with anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity . of these 104 compounds , 2 target the sar ##s - co ##v main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) , 7 target he ##lica ##se ( he ##l ) , and 18 target spike ( s ) protein - ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) - mediated viral entry . the ec ##50 of the majority of the 104 compounds determined by sar ##s - co ##v plaque reduction ass ##ay were found to be at low micro ##mo ##lar range . three selected compounds , mp ##57 ##6 , he ##60 ##2 , and ve ##60 ##7 , valid ##ated to be inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro , he ##l , and viral entry , respectively , exhibited potent anti ##vira ##l activity ( ec ##50 < 10 μ ##m ) and comparable inhibitor ##y activities in target - specific in vitro ass ##ays .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 and caused an epidemic in the middle east . public health england ( ph ##e ) manchester is one of the two ph ##e centres in the uk that perform testing for mer ##s - co ##v . the results of the ph ##e manchester mer ##s surveillance from 2012 to 2019 are presented in this report . methods retrospective data were collected for returning travellers from the middle east fitting the ph ##e mer ##s case definition . respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses and mer ##s - co ##v using an in - house rt - pc ##r ass ##ay . results four hundred and twenty - six ( 42 ##6 ) samples from 264 patients were tested for mer ##s co - v and respiratory viruses . no mer ##s - co ##v infections were identified by pc ##r . fifty - six percent of samples were pc ##r positive for viral or bacterial pathogen with influenza a as the predominant virus ( 44 % ) . sixty - two percent of all patients had a pathogen identified with the highest po ##sit ##ivity from sp ##ut ##um samples . patients with multiple samples demonstrated a 100 % diagnostic yield . conclusions although no cases of mer ##s were identified , the majority of patients had influenza infection for which os ##elt ##ami ##vir treatment was indicated and isolation warrant ##ed . sp ##ut ##um samples were the most useful in dia ##gno ##sing respiratory viruses with a 100 % diagnostic yield from patients with multiple samples .  
summary background severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly emerged disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which spread globally in early 2003 , affecting over 30 countries . we have used molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology to define the patterns of spread of the virus in hong kong and beyond . methods the case definition of sar ##s was based on that recommended by who . we genetically sequence ##d the gene for the s ##1 unit of the viral spike protein of viruses from patients with sar ##s in hong kong ( 138 ) and guangdong ( three ) in february to april , 2003 . we undertook phylogenetic comparisons with 27 other sequences available from public databases ( gen ##bank ) . findings most of the hong kong viruses ( 139 / 142 ) , including those from a large outbreak in an apartment block , clustered closely together with the isolate from a single index case ( hk ##u - 33 ) who came from guangdong to hong kong in late february . three other isolate ##s were genetically distinct from hk ##u - 33 in hong kong during february , but none of these contributed substantially to the subsequent local outbreak . viruses identified in guangdong and beijing were genetically more diverse . interpretation the molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ological evidence suggests that most sar ##s - co ##v from the outbreak in hong kong , as well as the viruses from canada , vietnam , and singapore , are genetically closely linked . three viruses found in hong kong in february were phylogenetic ##ally distinct from the major cluster , which suggests that several introductions of the virus had occurred , but that only one was associated with the subsequent outbreak in hong kong , which in turn spread globally .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is the main cause of lung and kidney infections in developing countries such as saudi arabia and south korea . this infectious single - stranded , positive ( + ) sense rna virus enters the host by binding to dip ##ept ##id ##yl - peptide receptors . since no vaccine is yet available for mer ##s - co ##v , rapid case identification , isolation , and infection prevention strategies must be used to combat the spreading of mer ##s - co ##v infection . additionally , there is a desperate need for vaccines and anti ##vira ##l strategies . methods : the present study used im ##mun ##o - inform ##atics and computational approaches to identify conserved b - and t cell ep ##ito ##pes for the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein that may perform a significant role in eli ##cit ##ing the resistance response to mer ##s - co ##v infection . results : many conserved cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t - l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ep ##ito ##pes and disco ##nti ##nu ##ous and linear b - cell ep ##ito ##pes were predicted for the mer ##s - co ##v s protein , and their antigen ##ici ##ty and interactions with the human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) b ##7 all ##ele were estimated . among b - cell ep ##ito ##pes , q ##l ##q ##mg ##f ##git ##v ##q ##y ##gt displayed the highest antigen ##ici ##ty - score , and was immensely im ##mun ##ogenic . among t - cell ep ##ito ##pes , m ##hc class - i peptide y ##k ##l ##q ##pl ##tf ##l and m ##hc class - ii peptide y ##ci ##le ##pr ##sg were identified as highly antigen ##ic . furthermore , docking analyses revealed that the predicted peptide ##s engaged in strong bonding with the h ##la - b ##7 all ##ele . conclusion : the present study identified several mer ##s - co ##v s protein ep ##ito ##pes that are conserved among various isolate ##s from different countries . the put ##ative antigen ##ic ep ##ito ##pes may prove effective as novel vaccines for era ##dication and combat ##ing of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) administered intra ##nas ##ally and intra ##tra ##che ##ally to r ##hes ##us , cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus and african green monkeys ( ag ##m ) replicate ##d in the respiratory tract but did not induce illness . the ti ##ter of serum neutral ##izing antibodies correlated with the level of virus replication in the respiratory tract ( ag ##m > cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus > r ##hes ##us ) . moderate to high ti ##ters of sar ##s - co ##v with associated inter ##sti ##tial p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis were detected in the lungs of ag ##ms on day 2 and were resolving by day 4 post - infection . following challenge of ag ##ms 2 months later , virus replication was highly restricted and there was no evidence of enhanced disease . these species will be useful for the evaluation of the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of candidate vaccines , but the lack of apparent clinical illness in all three species , variability from animal to animal in level of viral replication , and rapid clearance of virus and p ##ne ##um ##oni ##tis in ag ##ms must be taken into account by investigators considering the use of these species in efficacy and challenge studies .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003 . the sar ##s - co ##v genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . the first or ##f ( 1a and 1b ) en ##codes a large poly ##pro ##tein that is cl ##ea ##ved into non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins ( ns ##p ) . the other or ##fs en ##code for four structural proteins ( spike , membrane , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and envelope ) as well as eight sar ##s - co ##v - specific accessory proteins ( 3a , 3 ##b , 6 , 7 ##a , 7 ##b , 8 ##a , 8 ##b and 9 ##b ) . in this report we have clone ##d the predicted ns ##p ##8 gene and the or ##f ##6 gene of the sar ##s - co ##v and studied their abilities to interact with each other . we expressed the two proteins as fusion proteins in the yeast two - hybrid system to demonstrate protein – protein interactions and tested the same using a yeast genetic cross . further the strength of the interaction was measured by challenging growth of the positive interaction clones on increasing gradient ##s of 2 - amino tri ##zo ##le . the interaction was then verified by expressing both proteins separately in - vitro in a coupled - transcription translation system and by co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation in mammalian cells . finally , col ##oca ##lization experiments were performed in sar ##s - co ##v infected ve ##ro e ##6 mammalian cells to confirm the ns ##p ##8 – or ##f ##6 interaction . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of the interaction between a sar ##s - co ##v accessory protein and ns ##p ##8 and our findings suggest that or ##f ##6 protein may play a role in virus replication .  
abstract the origins and evolutionary history of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) remain an issue of uncertainty and debate . based on evolutionary analyses of corona ##virus dna sequences , encompassing an approximately 13 ##k ##b stretch of the sar ##s - tor ##2 genome , we provide evidence that sar ##s - co ##v has a rec ##om ##bina ##nt history with lineage ##s of types i and iii corona ##virus . we identified a minimum of five rec ##om ##bina ##nt regions ranging from 83 to 86 ##3 ##b ##p in length and including the polymer ##ase , ns ##p ##9 , ns ##p ##10 , and ns ##p ##14 . our results are consistent with a hypothesis of viral host jumping events , con ##com ##itan ##t with the re ##ass ##ort ##ment of bird and mammalian corona ##virus ##es , a scenario analogous to earlier outbreak ##s of influenza ##e .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v 3a protein was a unique protein of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , which was identified in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells and sar ##s patients ’ specimen . recent studies revealed that 3a could interact specifically with many sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins , such as m , e and s protein . expressed 3a protein was reported to local ##ize to go ##l ##gi complex in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells . in this study , it was shown that 3a protein was mainly located in go ##l ##gi apparatus with different tags at n - or c - terminus . the local ##ization pattern was similar in different trans ##fect ##ed cells . with the ass ##ay of truncated 3a protein , it was shown that 3a might contain three trans ##me ##mb ##rane regions , and the second or third region was properly responsible for go ##l ##gi local ##ization . by ultra - cent ##ri ##fu ##gation experiment with different extraction buffer ##s , it was confirmed that 3a was an integral membrane protein and embedded in the ph ##os ##ph ##oli ##pid bi ##layer . im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay indicated that 3a was co - localized with m protein in go ##l ##gi complex in co - trans ##fect ##ed cells . these results provide a new insight for further study of the 3a protein on the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v .  
summary the middle east respiratory corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first isolated from a patient who died with severe pneumonia in june 2012 . as of 19 june 2015 , a total of 1 , 338 mer ##s - co ##v infections have been notified to the world health organization ( who ) . clinical illness associated with mer ##s - co ##v ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi - organ failure . a significant proportion of patients present with non - respiratory symptoms such as headache , my ##al ##gia , vomiting and dia ##rr ##hoe ##a . a few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been con ##clusive ##ly shown to be clinical ##ly effective . human to human transmission is well documented , but the epidemic potential of mer ##s - co ##v remains limited at present . healthcare - associated clusters of mer ##s - co ##v have been responsible for the majority of reported cases . the largest outbreak ##s have been driven by delayed diagnosis , over ##crow ##ding and poor infection control practices . however , chains of mer ##s - co ##v transmission can be readily interrupted with implementation of appropriate control measures . as with any emerging infectious disease , guidelines for mer ##s - co ##v case identification and surveillance evolved as new data became available . sound clinical judgment is required to identify unusual presentations and trigger appropriate control precautions . evidence from multiple sources imp ##lica ##tes dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s as natural hosts of mer ##s - co ##v . camel to human transmission has been demonstrated , but the exact mechanism of infection remains uncertain . the ubiquitous ##ly available social media have facilitated communication and networking amongst healthcare professionals and eventually proved to be important channels for presenting the public with factual material , timely updates and relevant advice .  
background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to be reported from the kingdom of saudi arabia . data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for mer ##s - co ##v on reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) with negative results in between are lacking . here we describe cases with intermittent positive mer ##s - co ##v test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in mer ##s - co ##v infection based on a large retrospective co ##hort of patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v . methods this analysis included cases admitted between january 2014 and december 2017 . the included patients had a minimum of 3 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for mer ##s - co ##v evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance . results a total of 40 ##8 patients with positive mer ##s - co ##v test results were treated at the referring hospital . we excluded 72 patients who had only 1 sw ##ab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease . of the remaining 336 patients , 300 ( 89 % ) had a positive result after 1 sw ##ab , 324 ( 96 . 5 % ) had a positive result after 2 consecutive sw ##ab ##s , and 328 ( 97 . 6 % ) had a positive result after 3 consecutive sw ##ab ##s . of the total cases , 46 ( 13 . 7 % ) had a positive mer ##s - co ##v test then a negative test , followed by positive test results . conclusions our data indicate that 2 to 3 nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for mer ##s - co ##v . in addition , 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from mer ##s - co ##v . evaluation of the yield of sp ##ut ##um samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s .  
abstract the rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( rn ##p ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was expressed in a ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system . the pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v rn ##p was used as an antigen for detection of sar ##s - co ##v antibodies in i ##gg enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . the elisa was evaluated in comparison with neutral ##izing antibody ass ##ay and the authentic sar ##s - co ##v antigen - based i ##gg elisa . two - hundred and seventy - six serum samples were collected from health care workers in a hospital in which a nos ##oco ##mia ##l sar ##s outbreak took place and used for evaluation . the sar ##s - co ##v rn ##p - based i ##gg elisa has 92 % of sensitivity and specific ##ity compared with the neutral ##izing antibody ass ##ay and 94 % sensitivity and specific ##ity compared with the authentic sar ##s - co ##v antigen - based i ##gg elisa . the results suggest that the newly developed sar ##s - co ##v rn ##p - based i ##gg elisa is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and ser ##oe ##pid ##emi ##ological study of sar ##s . the sar ##s - co ##v rn ##p - based i ##gg elisa has an advantage over the conventional i ##gg elisa in that the antigen can be prepared by laboratory workers without the risk of infection .  
summary from early march 2003 to late may 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was detected in singapore . the increase in work ##load and new infection control procedures were thought to affect res ##us ##cit ##ation and air ##way management . our aim was to study the effects of wearing of personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) and powered air - pu ##ri ##fying res ##pi ##rator ( pa ##pr ) and the restriction in the number of res ##us ##cit ##ation personnel on air ##way management during the sar ##s crisis . data was collected prospective ##ly through an ongoing emergency air ##way registry . the data was divided into three periods : ( 1 ) before pp ##e was instituted from 1 november 2002 to 31 march 2003 ; ( 2 ) during sar ##s ( when pp ##e use was mandatory ) from 1 april to 31 july 2003 ; ( 3 ) post - sar ##s ( when pp ##e use was non - mandatory but encouraged ) from 1 august to 31 march 2004 . there was no change in patient demographics during the three periods . there were significant increases in the proportion of res ##us ##cit ##ation cases and air ##way interventions during the sar ##s period compared to the pre - sar ##s period . the resident medical officer int ##uba ##tion rate decreased from 45 . 1 % pre - sar ##s to 35 . 2 % during sar ##s and 17 . 7 % post - sar ##s . the com ##plication rates were 10 . 5 % , 9 . 9 % and 9 . 4 % in periods 1 – 3 , respectively . restriction in the number of healthcare staff attending to each patient may have influenced the department ' s decision to allow only the most confident or experienced personnel to manage the air ##way . the exposure of junior medical officers in emergency air ##way management during sar ##s and the immediate post - sar ##s period was decreased . this trend should be monitored further and intervention may be necessary should it continue to decline .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) in ##fect humans and many animal species , and are associated with respiratory , enter ##ic , he ##pati ##c , and central nervous system diseases . the large size of the co ##v genome and the instability of some co ##v replica ##se gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria , represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense rna viruses . to overcome these limitations , several alternatives to more conventional pl ##as ##mi ##d - based approaches have been established in the last 13 years . in this report , we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for co ##vs , paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) .  
abstract the saudi arabian ministry of health implemented a pro - active surveillance programme for middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . we report mer ##s - co ##v data from 50 ##65 kingdom of saudi arabia individuals who were screened for mer ##s - co ##v over a 12 - month period . from 1 october 2012 to 30 september 2013 , demographic and clinical data were prospective ##ly collected from all laboratory forms received at the saudi arabian vi ##rol ##ogy reference laboratory . data were anal ##yse ##d by refer ##ral type , age , gender , and mer ##s - co ##v real - time pc ##r test results . five thousand and 65 individuals were screened for mer - co ##v : hospitalized patients with suspected mer ##s - co ##v infection ( n = 290 ##8 , 57 . 4 % ) , healthcare worker ( hc ##w ) contacts ( n = 1695 ; 33 . 5 % ) , and family contacts of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s cases ( n = 46 ##2 ; 9 . 1 % ) . eleven per cent of persons tested were children ( < 17 years of age ) . there were 108 cases ( 99 adults and nine children ) of mer ##s - co ##v infection detected during the 12 - month period ( 108 / 50 ##65 , 2 % case detection rate ) . of 108 cases , 45 were females ( six children and 39 adults ) and 63 were males ( three children and 60 adults ) . of the 99 adults with mer ##s - co ##v infection , 70 were hospitalized patients , 19 were hc ##w contacts , and ten were family contacts . there were no significant increases in mer ##s - co ##v detection rates over the 12 - month period : 2 . 6 % ( 19 / 73 ##1 ) in july 2013 , 1 . 7 % ( 19 / 1100 ) in august 2013 , and 1 . 69 % ( 21 / 123 ##8 ) in september 2013 . male patients had a significantly higher mer ##s - co ##v infection rate ( 63 / 231 ##8 , 2 . 7 % ) than females ( 45 / 274 ##7 , 1 . 6 % ) ( p 0 . 01 ##3 ) . mer ##s - co ##v rates remain at low levels , with no significant increase over time . pro - active surveillance for mer ##s - co ##v in newly diagnosed patients and their contacts will continue .  
summary background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a zoo ##not ##ic infection causing severe viral pneumonia , with index cases having resided in or recently travelled to the arabian peninsula , and is a global concern for public health . limited human - to - human transmission , leading to some case clusters , has been reported . mer ##s - co ##v has been reported in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s but ph ##eno ##typic character ##isation of such viruses is limited . we aimed to compare mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in saudi arabia and egypt with a prototype human mer ##s - co ##v to assess virus replication competence and cell tr ##op ##ism in ex - vivo cultures of human bro ##nch ##us and lung . methods we characterised mer ##s - co ##v viruses from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in saudi arabia and egypt and compared them with a human mer ##s - co ##v reference strain . we assessed viral replication kinetic ##s and competence in ve ##ro - e ##6 cells ( r ##hes ##us monkey ) , tissue tr ##op ##ism in cultures of ex - vivo human bro ##nch ##ial and lung tissues , and cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e induction , gene expression , and quan ##ti ##fication of viral rna in cal ##u - 3 cells ( human respiratory tract ) . we used mock - infected tissue as negative controls for ex - vivo experiments and influenza a h ##5 ##n ##1 as a positive control for cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e induction experiments in cal ##u - 3 cells . findings we isolated three dr ##ome ##dar ##y strains , two from saudi arabia ( dr ##ome ##dar ##y / al - has ##a - k ##fu - hk ##u ##13 / 2013 [ ah ##13 ] and dr ##ome ##dar ##y / al - has ##a - k ##fu - hk ##u ##19 ##d / 2013 [ ah ##19 ##d ] ) , and one from egypt ( dr ##ome ##dar ##y / egypt - nr ##ce - hk ##u ##27 ##0 / 2013 [ nr ##ce - hk ##u ##27 ##0 ] ) . the human and dr ##ome ##dar ##y mer ##s - co ##v strains had similar viral replication competence in ve ##ro - e ##6 cells and respiratory tr ##op ##ism in ex - vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract , and had similar ability to evade inter ##fer ##on responses in the human - respiratory - tract - derived cell line cal ##u - 3 . interpretation the similarity of virus tr ##op ##ism and replication competence of human and dr ##ome ##dar ##y mer ##s - co ##v from the arabian peninsula , and genetically diverse dr ##ome ##dar ##y viruses from egypt , in ex - vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract suggests that dr
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was originally identified in saudi arabia in 2012 . it has caused mer ##s outbreak ##s with high mortality in the middle east and europe , raising a serious concern about its pan ##de ##mic potential . therefore , development of effective vaccines is crucial for preventing its further spread and future pan ##de ##mic . our previous study has shown that sub ##cut ##aneous ( s . c . ) va ##cci ##nation of a rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein containing receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of mer ##s - co ##v s fused with fc of human i ##gg ( rb ##d - fc ) induced strong systemic neutral ##izing antibody responses in va ##cci ##nated mice . here , we compared local and systemic immune responses induced by rb ##d - fc via intra ##nas ##al ( i . n . ) and s . c . im ##mun ##ization pathways . we found that i . n . va ##cci ##nation of mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - fc induced systemic humor ##al immune responses comparable to those induced by s . c . va ##cci ##nation , including neutral ##izing antibodies , but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly higher local mu ##cos ##al immune responses in mouse lungs . this study suggests the potential of developing mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d protein into an effective and safe mu ##cos ##al candidate vaccine for prevention of respiratory tract infections caused by mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract e protein is a membrane component of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . disruption of e protein may reduce viral in ##fect ##ivity . thus , the sar ##s - co ##v e protein is considered a potential target for the development of anti ##vira ##l drugs . however , the cellular immune responses to e protein remain unclear in humans . in this study , we found that peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) from fully recovered sar ##s individuals rapidly produced if ##n - γ and il - 2 following stimulation with a pool of 9 peptide ##s overlapping the entire e protein sequence . analysis of the immune responses by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry showed that both cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells were involved in the sar ##s - co ##v e - specific immune responses after stimulation with sar ##s - co ##v e peptide ##s . moreover , the majority of if ##n - γ + cd ##4 + t cells were central memory cells expressing cd ##45 ##ro + cc ##r ##7 + cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− ; whereas if ##n - γ + cd ##8 + memory t cells were mostly effect ##or memory cells expressing cd ##45 ##ro ##− ##cc ##r ##7 ##− ##cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− . the results of t - cell responses to 9 individual peptide ##s indicated that the e protein contained at least two major t cell ep ##ito ##pes ( e ##2 amino acid [ aa ] 9 – 26 and e ##5 – 6 : aa 33 – 57 ) which were important in eli ##cit ##ing cellular immune response to sar ##s - co ##v e protein in humans .  
abstract over 10 years have passed since the deadly human corona ##virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged from the guangdong province of china . despite the fact that the sar ##s - co ##v pan ##de ##mic infected over 850 ##0 individuals , claimed over 800 lives and cost billions of dollars in economic loss worldwide , there still are no clinical ##ly approved anti ##vira ##l drugs , vaccines or mono ##cl ##onal antibody the ##ra ##pies to treat sar ##s - co ##v infections . the recent emergence of the deadly human corona ##virus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a sober ##ing reminder that new and deadly corona ##virus ##es can emerge at any time with the potential to become pan ##de ##mics . therefore , the continued development of therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic counter ##me ##as ##ures to potentially deadly corona ##virus ##es is warrant ##ed . the corona ##vira ##l pro ##tea ##ses , papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) and 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) , are attractive anti ##vira ##l drug targets because they are essential for corona ##vira ##l replication . although the primary function of pl ##pro and 3 ##cl ##pro are to process the viral poly ##pro ##tein in a coordinated manner , pl ##pro has the additional function of stripping u ##bi ##qui ##tin and is ##g ##15 from host - cell proteins to aid corona ##virus ##es in their eva ##sion of the host innate immune responses . therefore , targeting pl ##pro with anti ##vira ##l drugs may have an advantage in not only inhibit ##ing viral replication but also inhibit ##ing the d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of signaling cascade ##s in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding , un ##in ##fect ##ed cells . this review provides an up - to - date discussion on the sar ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se including a brief overview of the sar ##s - co ##v genome and replication followed by a more in - depth discussion on the structure and catalytic mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , the multiple cellular functions of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , the inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro by small molecule inhibitors , and the prospect of inhibit ##ing papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se from other corona ##virus ##es . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ” 
abstract background in may 2015 , an imported case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection occurred in china , so rapid and reliable diagnosis of suspected cases was necessary . objectives an external quality assessment ( e ##qa ) program for the molecular detection of mer ##s - co ##v was organized by the national center for clinical laboratories ( nc ##cl ) . study design ms ##2 virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) en ##cap ##sul ##ating specific rna sequences of mer ##s - co ##v were prepared as positive specimens . the assessment panel , which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of v ##lp ##s , was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces , municipalities , or autonomous regions for molecular detection . results among the received data sets , three employed an in - house - developed real - time reverse - transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) ass ##ay and the others applied various commercial rr ##t - pc ##r kits . overall , the majority of laboratories ( 46 / 56 , 82 . 1 % ) could achieve 100 % accuracy for mer ##s - co ##v detection , but three laboratories ( 5 . 4 % ) still had room for improvement . consequently , all negative samples were identified correctly , reaching 100 % specific ##ity . the false - negative rate was 3 . 1 % , and most of the false - negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration , indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak - positive specimens . conclusions the majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of mer ##s - co ##v . moreover , e ##qa is ind ##is ##pen ##sable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has become a global public health emergency . understanding the molecular mechanisms of sar ##s - induced cy ##top ##athic effects ( cp ##es ) is a rational approach for the prevention of sar ##s , and an understanding of the cellular stress responses induced by viral infection is important for understanding the cp ##es . poly ##cl ##onal antibodies , which recognized nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and membrane ( m ) proteins , detected viral n and m proteins in virus - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells at least 6 and 12 ##h post - infection ( h . p . i . ) , respectively . furthermore , detection of dna ladder and cl ##ea ##ved cas ##pas ##e - 3 in the virus - infected cells at 24 ##h . p . i . indicated that sar ##s - co ##v infection induced ap ##op ##to ##tic cell death . ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of p ##38 map ##k was significantly up - regulated at 18 ##h . p . i . in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . the downstream targets of p ##38 map ##k , map ##ka ##p ##k - 2 , hs ##p - 27 , cr ##eb , and e ##if ##4 ##e were ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in virus - infected cells . the p ##38 map ##k inhibitor , sb ##20 ##35 ##80 , inhibit ##ed effectively ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of hs ##p - 27 , cr ##eb , and e ##if ##4 ##e in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . however , viral protein synthesis was not affected by treatment of sb ##20 ##35 ##80 .  
abstract the genome organization and expression strategy of the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were predicted using recently published genome sequences . fourteen put ##ative open reading frames were identified , 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nest ##ed set of eight sub ##gen ##omic mrna ##s . the synthesis of these mrna ##s in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells was confirmed experimental ##ly . the 43 ##8 ##2 - and 70 ##7 ##3 amino acid residue sar ##s - co ##v replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s are predicted to be cl ##ea ##ved into 16 subunit ##s by two viral protein ##ase ##s ( bringing the total number of sar ##s - co ##v proteins to 28 ) . a phylogenetic analysis of the replica ##se gene , using a distant ##ly related toro ##virus as an out ##group , demonstrated that , despite a number of unique features , sar ##s - co ##v is most closely related to group 2 corona ##virus ##es . distant homo ##log ##s of cellular rna processing enzymes were identified in group 2 corona ##virus ##es , with four of them being conserved in sar ##s - co ##v . these newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of corona ##virus rna synthesis in a completely new perspective . furthermore , together with previously described viral enzymes , they will be important targets for the design of anti ##vira ##l strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract a secret ##ed , g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted poly ##pe ##pt ##ide containing amino acids 14 to 76 ##2 of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein and a poly ##his ##ti ##dine tag was expressed in rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus - infected insect cells . mice received the affinity - pu ##rified protein with either a sap ##oni ##n ( q ##s ##21 ) or a rib ##i ( mp ##l + td ##m ) ad ##ju ##vant sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly and were challenged intra ##nas ##ally with sar ##s - co ##v . both regime ##ns induced binding and neutral ##izing antibodies and protection against sar ##s - co ##v intra ##nas ##al infection . however , the best results were obtained with q ##s ##21 and protein , which provided the highest antibody as well as complete protection of the upper and lower respiratory tract .  
abstract structure - based design , synthesis , and biological evaluation of a series of pep ##ti ##dom ##ime ##tic severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se inhibitors are described . these inhibitors were designed and synthesized based upon our x - ray crystal structure of inhibitor 1 bound to sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . incorporation of bo ##c - ser as the p ##4 - ligand resulted in enhanced sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitor ##y activity . structural analysis of the inhibitor - bound x - ray structure revealed high binding affinity toward the enzyme .  
abstract the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 led to an intense and effective global response that stopped the spread of the disease by july 2003 . there was also an intensive and very productive research effort to identify the ae ##ti ##ological agent , character ##ise the clinical and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological features of the disease , understand the pathogen ##esis of the disease and the molecular biology of the virus , and design anti ##vira ##l drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the disease . in parallel with the sar ##s research effort there have been continuous improvements in our ability to detect and character ##ise other novel viruses . the sar ##s outbreak illustrates the importance of such detection tools in the response to public health threats . studies since the sar ##s outbreak suggest that many novel viruses exist in animals and some , but probably not many , will present a risk to humans .  
abstract stil ##ben ##e derivatives have wide range of activities . in an effort to find other potential activities of this kind of compounds , 17 derivatives , including res ##vera ##tro ##l , were synthesized . twelve of them were evaluated for their anti ##vira ##l potential against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v - induced cy ##top ##athic ##ity in ve ##ro e ##6 cell culture . the result showed that sar ##s virus was totally inhibit ##ed by compounds 17 and 19 ( ≤ ##0 . 5 mg ml – 1 ) and no significant cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c effects were observed in vitro .  
abstract background transmission of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is now well controlled , nevertheless , it is important to develop effective methods to identify this virus from other pathogen ##s . objectives the purpose of this study was to identify potential ligand ##s and develop a novel diagnostic test to sar ##s - co ##v using ph ##age display technology . study design the sar ##s - co ##v spike 1 ( s ##1 ) protein containing the receptor binding region ( rb ##d ) was used as an im ##mo ##bil ##ized target followed by inc ##uba ##tion with a 12 - mer ph ##age display random peptide library . after four rounds of bio ##pan ##ning , 10 mono ##cl ##onal ph ##ages with specific binding activity to the s ##1 - rb ##d protein were obtained and subjected to binding and diagnostic ass ##ays . results dna sequencing showed that two ph ##age displayed peptide ##s h ##h ##kt ##w ##hp ##p ##v ##m ##hl ( ph ##age - h ) and sq ##w ##hp ##rsa ##sy ##pm ( ph ##age - s ) that were specific ligand ##s to the s ##1 protein . moreover , the selected ph ##age - h and ph ##age - s were capable of different ##iating sar ##s - co ##v from other corona ##virus ##es in indirect enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays . conclusion the peptide ##s identified in this study are useful re ##age ##nts for detection of sar ##s - co ##v .  
corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is an ongoing global health emergency . here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission , as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic and pre ##sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic virus shed ##ding , diagnosis , treatment , vaccine development , origin of virus and viral pathogen ##esis .  
abstract there are currently no approved vaccines or small molecule therapeutic ##s available for the prop ##hyl ##ax ##is or treatment of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections . mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se is essential for viral replication ; consequently , it is an attractive target that provides a potentially effective means of developing small molecule therapeutic ##s for combat ##ting mer ##s - co ##v . we describe here ##in the structure - guided design and evaluation of a novel class of inhibitors of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se that em ##body a piper ##idi ##ne moi ##ety as a design element that is well - suited to exploit ##ing favorable sub ##sit ##e binding interactions to attain optimal ph ##arm ##aco ##logical activity and p ##k properties . the mechanism of action of the compounds and the structural deter ##mina ##nts associated with binding were illuminated using x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy .  
summary background a new beta ##cor ##ona ##virus — middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) — has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection . although related viruses in ##fect bats , molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of mer ##s - co ##v . an ##ec ##dot ##al exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s or goats . we investigated possible animal reservoirs of mer ##s - co ##v by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock . methods we took sera from animals in the middle east ( oman ) and from elsewhere ( spain , netherlands , chile ) . cattle ( n = 80 ) , sheep ( n = 40 ) , goats ( n = 40 ) , dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ( n = 155 ) , and various other camel ##id species ( n = 34 ) were tested for specific serum i ##gg by protein micro ##ar ##ray using the receptor - binding s ##1 subunit ##s of spike proteins of mer ##s - co ##v , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus , and human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 . results were confirmed by virus neutral ##isation tests for mer ##s - co ##v and bo ##vine corona ##virus . findings 50 of 50 ( 100 % ) sera from oman ##i camel ##s and 15 of 105 ( 14 % ) from spanish camel ##s had protein - specific antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v spike . sera from european sheep , goats , cattle , and other camel ##ids had no such antibodies . mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##ising antibody ti ##tres varied between 1 / 320 and 1 / 256 ##0 for the oman ##i camel sera and between 1 / 20 and 1 / 320 for the spanish camel sera . there was no evidence for cross - neutral ##isation by bo ##vine corona ##virus antibodies . interpretation mer ##s - co ##v or a related virus has infected camel populations . both ti ##tres and ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce ##s in sera from different locations in oman suggest widespread infection . funding european union , european centre for disease prevention and control , deutsche for ##sch ##ung ##sg ##eme ##ins ##chaft .  
abstract tracing the history of molecular changes in corona ##virus ##es using phylogenetic methods can provide powerful insights into the patterns of modification to sequences that under ##lie alteration to selective pressure and molecular function in the sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ) genome . the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic relationships among the family corona ##vir ##idae , including sar ##s - co ##v , have been estimated using the replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein . the spike protein fragments s ##1 ( involved in receptor - binding ) and s ##2 ( involved in membrane fusion ) have been found to have different mutation rates . fragment s ##1 can be further divided into two regions ( s ##1 ##a , which comprises approximately the first 400 nu ##cle ##otide ##s , and s ##1 ##b , comprising the next 280 ) that also show different rates of mutation . the ph ##yl ##ogen ##y presented on the basis of s ##1 ##b shows that sar ##s - co ##v is closely related to m ##h ##v ( mu ##rine hepatitis virus ) , which is known to bind the mu ##rine receptor ce ##aca ##m ##1 . the predicted structure , accessibility and mutation rate of the s ##1 ##b region is also presented . because anti - sar ##s drugs based on s ##2 he ##pta ##ds have short half - lives and are difficult to manufacture , our findings suggest that the s ##1 ##b region might be of interest for anti - sar ##s drug discovery .  
abstract we previously reported that replacing hiv - 1 nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( nc ) domain with sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) residues 2 – 213 , 215 – 421 , or 234 – 421 results in efficient virus - like particle ( v ##lp ) production at a level comparable to that of wild - type hiv - 1 . in this study we demonstrate that these chi ##mer ##as are capable of packaging large amounts of human ap ##obe ##c ##3 ##g ( ha ##3 ##g ) , and that an hiv - 1 gag chi ##mer ##a containing the car ##box ##yl - terminal half of human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) n as a substitute for nc is capable of directing v ##lp assembly and efficiently packaging ha ##3 ##g . when co - expressed with sar ##s - co ##v n and m ( membrane ) proteins , ha ##3 ##g was efficiently incorporated into sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s . data from gs ##t pull - down ass ##ays suggest that the n sequence involved in n – ha ##3 ##g interactions is located between residues 86 and 302 . like hiv - 1 nc , the sar ##s - co ##v or hc ##ov - 229 ##e n - associated with ha ##3 ##g depends on the presence of rna , with the first link ##er region essential for ha ##3 ##g packaging into both hiv - 1 and sar ##s - co ##v v ##lp ##s . the results raise the possibility that ha ##3 ##g is capable of ass ##oc ##iating with different species of viral structural proteins through a potentially common , rna - mediated mechanism .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important viral structural protein . based on bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis , 10 antigen ##ic peptide ##s derived from the s protein sequence were selected and synthesized . the antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity of all the peptide ##s were tested in vivo and in vitro . four peptide ##s ( p ##6 , p ##8 , p ##9 and p ##10 ) which contain b cell ep ##ito ##pes of the s protein were identified , and p ##8 peptide was confirmed in vivo to have a potential in ser ##ological diagnosis . by using a sync ##yt ##ia formation model , we tested the neutral ##ization ability of all 10 peptide ##s and their corresponding antibodies . it is interesting to find that p ##8 and p ##9 peptide ##s inhibit ##ed sync ##yt ##ia formation , suggesting that the p ##8 and p ##9 spanning regions may provide a good target for anti - sar ##s - co ##v drug design . our data suggest that we have identified peptide ##s derived from the s protein of sar ##s - co ##v , which are useful for sar ##s treatment and diagnosis .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in a human with severe pneumonia in 2012 . since then , infections have been detected in > 1500 individuals , with disease severity ranging from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to severe , fatal pneumonia . to el ##uc ##ida ##te the pathogen ##esis of this virus and investigate mechanisms underlying disease severity variation in the absence of autopsy data , a r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue and common mar ##mos ##et model of mer ##s - co ##v disease were analyzed . r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues developed mild disease , and common mar ##mos ##ets exhibited moderate to severe , potentially lethal , disease . both non ##hum ##an primate species exhibited respiratory clinical signs after in ##oc ##ulation , which were more severe and of longer duration in the mar ##mos ##ets , and developed bro ##nch ##oint ##ers ##ti ##tial pneumonia . in mar ##mos ##ets , the pneumonia was more extensive , with development of severe air ##way lesions . quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of pulmonary ne ##ut ##rop ##hil in ##filtration and higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen in mar ##mos ##ets . pulmonary expression of the mer ##s - co ##v receptor , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 , was similar in mar ##mos ##ets and mac ##aq ##ues . these results suggest that increased virus replication and the local immune response to mer ##s - co ##v infection likely play a role in pulmonary pathology severity . together , the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue and common mar ##mos ##et models of mer ##s - co ##v span the wide range of disease severity reported in mer ##s - co ##v – infected humans , which will aid in investigating mer ##s - co ##v disease pathogen ##esis .  
abstract two novel corona ##virus ##es have emerged to cause severe disease in humans . while bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) likely crossed into humans from ci ##vet ##s in china , and mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been transmitted from camel ##s in the middle east . unlike sar ##s - co ##v that resolved within a year , continued introductions of mer ##s - co ##v present an on - going public health threat . animal models are needed to evaluate counter ##me ##as ##ures against emerging viruses . with sar ##s - co ##v , several animal species were per ##missive to infection . in contrast , most laboratory animals are ref ##rac ##tory or only semi - per ##missive to infection with mer ##s - co ##v . this host - range restriction is largely determined by sequence het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y in the mer ##s - co ##v receptor . we describe animal models developed to study corona ##virus ##es , with a focus on host - range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate counter ##me ##as ##ures against mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is considered as a major antigen for vaccine design . we previously demonstrated that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d : residues 318 – 510 ) of s protein contains multiple conform ##ation - dependent neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes ( con ##f i to vi ) and serves as a major target of sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##ization . here , we further characterized the antigen ##ic structure in the rb ##d by a panel of novel mab ##s isolated from the mice im ##mun ##ized with an inactivated sar ##s - co ##v vaccine . ten of the rb ##d - specific mab ##s were mapped to four distinct groups of conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pes ( designated group a to d ) , and all of which had potent neutral ##izing activity against s protein - pseudo ##type ##d sar ##s viruses . group a , b , c mab ##s target the ep ##ito ##pes that may overlap with the previously characterized con ##f i , iii , and vi respectively , but they display different capacity to block the receptor binding . group d mab ( s ##25 ) was directed against a unique ep ##ito ##pe by its competitive binding . two anti - rb ##d mab ##s recognizing the linear ep ##ito ##pes ( group e ) were mapped to the rb ##d residues 335 – 352 and 44 ##2 – 45 ##8 , respectively , and none of them inhibit ##ed the receptor binding and virus entry . surprisingly , most neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes ( groups a to c ) could be completely disrupted by single amino acid substitution ##s ( e . g . , d ##42 ##9 ##a , r ##44 ##1 ##a or d ##45 ##4 ##a ) or by del ##eti ##ons of several amino acids at the n - terminal or c - terminal region of the rb ##d ; however , the group d ep ##ito ##pe was not sensitive to the mutations , highlighting its importance for vaccine development . these data provide important information for understanding the antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v , and this panel of novel mab ##s can be used as tools for studying the structure of s protein and for guiding sar ##s vaccine design .  
summary depending on their destinations and activities , international travellers are at a significant risk of contracting both com ##mun ##ica ##ble and non - com ##mun ##ica ##ble diseases . on return to their home countries , such travellers may require intensive care . the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and more recently e ##bola ha ##em ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever , has highlighted the risks . other well - known com ##mun ##ica ##ble pathogen ##s such as met ##hic ##ill ##in - resistant st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##ccus au ##reus and car ##ba ##pen ##ema ##se - producing enter ##ob ##act ##eria ##ceae have been described previously . however , malaria remains by far the most important cause of death . the issues related to imported anti ##biotic resistance and protection from highly con ##tag ##ious diseases are reviewed here . surveillance strategies based on ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data ( country visited , duration of travel , and time el ##ap ##sed since return ) and clinical syndrome ##s , together with systematic search policies , are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak . single - bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results . because person - to - person contact is the main route of transmission , healthcare workers should implement specific prevention strategies .  
abstract the im ##mun ##ological ass ##ays for detection of antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v were developed in - house and some of them are available commercially . however , the antigen ##s used in these ass ##ays differed . in order to valid ##ate the reliability of these ass ##ays , the standard panel should be established . in this study , we have expressed and pu ##rified severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) structural proteins and their fragments and developed indirect enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( elisa ##s ) that detect antibodies against the sar ##s n , n ##1 , n ##2 , s ##1 , sc , s ##2 , and m proteins as well as the human corona ##virus o ##c ##43 and 229 ##e n proteins . these ass ##ays were used to screen 58 samples from sar ##s con ##vale ##scent patients , 40 serial serum specimens from patients at different phases of sar ##s infection , and 88 plasma specimens from normal blood donors . the samples from normal blood donors were also tested for antibodies against other respiratory virus . the representative samples were chosen to comprise a reference panel of sar ##s antibodies that may be used for the detection of sar ##s . the panel is composed of 25 positive samples , 25 negative samples , 7 dil ##uted samples for anti - n antibody , 6 dil ##uted samples for anti - s antibody , and one sample for valid ##ating precision . comparison of detection results with different sar ##s antibody ass ##ays indicated that our panel should differentiate the specific ##ity and sensitivity of different ass ##ays .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreak ##s in the arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region , raising the concern that a global pan ##de ##mic could occur . here , we show that a dna vaccine encoding the first 72 ##5 amino acids ( s ##1 ) of mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein induce ##s antigen - specific humor ##al and cellular immune responses in mice . with three im ##mun ##izations , high ti ##ters of neutral ##izing antibodies ( up to 1 : 104 ) were generated without ad ##ju ##vant . dna va ##cci ##nation with the mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen - specific cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells secret ##ing if ##n - γ and other cy ##tok ##ines . both pc ##dna ##3 . 1 - s ##1 dna vaccine im ##mun ##ization and passive transfer of immune serum from pc ##dna ##3 . 1 - s ##1 va ##cci ##nated mice protected ad ##5 - hd ##pp ##4 - trans ##duced mice from mer ##s - co ##v challenge . these results demonstrate that a dna vaccine encoding mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 protein induce ##s strong protective immune responses against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was a new human disease in the autumn of 2002 . it first occurred in southern china in november 2002 and was transported to hong kong on february 21 , 2003 by an infected and ill patient . ten secondary cases spread the infection to two hospitals in hong kong and to singapore , toronto and hanoi . in march 2003 a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was found to be the ca ##usa ##tive agent . within 11 weeks from the first sar ##s case in hong kong it had spread to an additional 27 countries or special administrative regions . the mini pan ##de ##mic peaked during the last week of may 2003 and the last new probable case was on july 13 , 2003 . there were a total of 80 ##9 ##6 probable cases and 77 ##4 deaths . sixty - six per cent of the cases occurred in china , 22 % in hong kong , 4 % in taiwan and 3 % in both singapore and canada . twenty - one per cent of all cases occurred in healthcare workers .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 . since then , almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries , with saudi arabia being the epic ##enter . this newly emerging virus is highly pathogen ##ic and has a case mortality rate of 35 % . it is similar to the co ##v causing severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in that both belong to the genus beta co ##vs that are of zoo ##not ##ic origin and cause lower respiratory infection . the natural reservoir for mer ##s - co ##v remains unknown . ser ##ological studies indicate that most dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the middle east have been infected with this virus , and they maybe the potential intermediate host . however , the mode of transmission from camel ##s to humans is poorly understood . the majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human - to - human transmission , most probably via respiratory route . patients most at risk of developing severe mer ##s - co ##v infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes , hyper ##tension , obesity , cardiac diseases , chronic respiratory diseases , and cancer . unlike sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v is considered an ongoing public health problem , particularly for the middle east region . in this chapter , we outline the prevailing information regarding the emergence and ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of this virus , its mode of transmission and pathogen ##ici ##ty , its clinical features , and the potential strategies for prevention .  
the continued emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) cases with a high case fatal ##ity rate stresses the need for the availability of effective anti ##vira ##l treatments . re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir ( gs - 57 ##34 ) effectively inhibit ##ed mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) replication in vitro , and showed efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v in a mouse model . here , we tested the efficacy of prop ##hyl ##actic and therapeutic re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment in a non ##hum ##an primate model of mer ##s - co ##v infection , the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue . prop ##hyl ##actic re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment initiated 24 h prior to in ##oc ##ulation completely prevented mer ##s - co ##v ##− ##ind ##uce ##d clinical disease , strongly inhibit ##ed mer ##s - co ##v replication in respiratory tissues , and prevented the formation of lung lesions . therapeutic re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment initiated 12 h post ##ino ##cula ##tion also provided a clear clinical benefit , with a reduction in clinical signs , reduced virus replication in the lungs , and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions . the data presented here support testing of the efficacy of re ##md ##es ##iv ##ir treatment in the context of a mer ##s clinical trial . it may also be considered for a wider range of corona ##virus ##es , including the currently emerging novel corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov .

abstract this is a further study on the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) using the pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic models . the purpose was to define the potential targets for anti - sar ##s drugs in the structural proteins from human sar ##s related corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) while knowing little about the functional sites and possible mutations in these proteins . from a pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic viewpoint , we can theoretically select the amino acid pairs as potential candidates for anti - sar ##s drugs . these candidates have a greater chance of col ##lid ##ing with anti - sar ##s drugs , are more likely to link with the protein functions and are less vulnerable to mutations .  
abstract the global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) during the first half of 2003 resulted in over 800 ##0 cases with more than 800 deaths . many of those who eventually died , did so in the critical ( intensive ) care units of various hospitals around the world , and many secondary cases of sar ##s arose in healthcare workers looking after such patients in these units . research on sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) demonstrated that this virus belongs to the same family of viruses , the corona ##vir ##idae that causes the common cold , with some important differences . properties of this virus have been discovered which can be used to develop important infection control policies within hospitals to limit the number of secondary cases . these properties include environmental survival , trans ##mis ##sibility , viral load in various organs and fluids and periods of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic illness during which in ##fect ##ivity is greatest . various barrier methods were used throughout the epidemic to protect healthcare workers from sar ##s , with varying degrees of success . treatment of sar ##s patients has mainly involved ste ##roid therapy , with or without rib ##avi ##rin , but there is no consensus on the best treatment protocol , as yet . this review focuses on the implications of sar ##s for healthcare workers and patients on critical care units .  
abstract previously , we reported the establishment of cells with persistent sar ##s - co ##v infection after ap ##op ##to ##tic events and showed that both j ##nk and pi ##3 ##k / ak ##t signaling pathways are important for persistence by treatment with inhibitors at the early stages of sar ##s - co ##v infection . however , the mechanisms of establishment of persistent infection are still unclear . in this study , we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from ap ##op ##tosis in cells infected with sar ##s - co ##v . in persistent ##ly infected cells at 50 ##h . p . i . , pi ##3 ##k / ak ##t , j ##nk , p ##38 map ##k and bc ##l - 2 were ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated and the protein levels of bc ##l - 2 and bc ##l - xl were increased . when surviving cells were treated with the j ##nk - specific inhibitor , sp ##60 ##01 ##25 , at 50 ##h . p . i . , all cells died , suggesting that the j ##nk signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistent ##ly infected cells . among the signaling pathways in persistent ##ly infected cells , ak ##t and j ##nk were ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in sar ##s - co ##v - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein - expressing ve ##ro e ##6 cells using va ##cci ##nia viral vector ( di ##s ) , strongly suggesting that n protein - induced ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of ak ##t and j ##nk are necessary to establish persistence . these results indicated that at least four proteins , ak ##t , j ##nk , bc ##l - 2 and bc ##l - xl , are necessary for survival of persistent ##ly sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells .  
summary the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and of the middle east syndrome corn ##avi ##rus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) caused widespread fear and concern for their potential threat to global health security . there are similarities and differences in the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical features between these two diseases . the origin of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v is thought to be an animal source with subsequent transmission to humans . the identification of both the intermediate host and the exact route of transmission of mer ##s - co ##v is crucial for the subsequent prevention of the introduction of the virus into the human population . so far mer ##s - co ##v had resulted in a limited travel - associated human cases with no major events related to the ha ##j ##j .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a novel human corona ##virus that caused outbreak ##s of a sar ##s - like illness in the middle east , is now considered a threat to global public health . this review discusses the challenges in identifying the source of this fatal virus and developing effective and safe anti - mer ##s - co ##v vaccines and therapeutic ##s in order to control its spread and to combat any future pan ##de ##mic .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infection in humans . camel ##s are the likely animal source for zoo ##not ##ic infection , although exact transmission modes remain to be determined . human - to - human transmission occurs sporadic ##ally . the wide geographic distribution of mer ##s - co ##v among dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and ongoing transmissions to humans provides concern for the evolution of a mer ##s - co ##v variant with efficient human - to - human transmission capabilities . phylogenetic analysis of mer ##s - co ##v has occurred by analysis of full - length genome ##s or multiple con ##cate ##nated genome fragments , which is time - consuming , costly and limited to high viral load samples . objective to develop a simple , reliable mer ##s - co ##v variant typing ass ##ay to facilitate monitoring of mer ##s - co ##v diversity in animals and humans . study design phylogenetic analysis of presently known full - length mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s was performed to identify gen ##omic regions with sufficient phylogenetic content to allow reliable mer ##s - co ##v variant typing . rt - pc ##r ass ##ays targeting these regions were designed and opt ##imi ##zed . results a reverse - transcription pc ##r ass ##ay for mer ##s - co ##v targeting a 61 ##5 ##b ##p spike fragment provides a phylogenetic cluster ##ing of mer ##s - co ##v variants comparable to that of full - length genome ##s . the detection limit corresponds to a cycle tres ##hold value of [UNK] with standard up ##e real time pc ##r ass ##ays on rna isolated from mer ##s - co ##v em ##c . nasal sw ##ab ##s from rt - pc ##r positive camel ##s ( ct values 12 . 9 – 32 . 2 ) yielded reliable sequence information in 14 samples . conclusions we developed a simple , reliable mer ##s - co ##v variant typing ass ##ay which is crucial in monitoring mer ##s - co ##v circulation in real time with relatively little investment on location .  
abstract in this study , the persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was observed in fe ##ces , urine and water . in addition , the ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v in wastewater with sodium h ##yp ##och ##lor ##ite and ch ##lor ##ine dioxide was also studied . in vitro experiments demonstrated that the virus could only persist for 2 days in hospital wastewater , domestic sewage and dec ##hl ##orin ##ated tap water , while 3 days in fe ##ces , 14 days in pbs and 17 days in urine at 20 ##° ##c . however , at 4 ##° ##c , the sar ##s - co ##v could persist for 14 days in wastewater and at least 17 days in fe ##ces or urine . sar ##s - co ##v is more susceptible to di ##sin ##fect ##ants than es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and f ##2 ph ##age . free ch ##lor ##ine was found to ina ##ct ##ivate sar ##s - co ##v better than ch ##lor ##ine dioxide . free residue ch ##lor ##ine over 0 . 5 ##mg / l for ch ##lor ##ine or 2 . 19 ##mg / l for ch ##lor ##ine dioxide in wastewater ensures complete ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v while it does not ina ##ct ##ivate completely e . coli and f ##2 ph ##age .  
abstract corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a kind of viral pneumonia with an unusual outbreak in wu ##han , china , in december 2019 , which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in the twenty - first century . in this mini ##re ##view , we provide a brief introduction of the general features of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and discuss current knowledge of molecular immune pathogen ##esis , diagnosis and treatment of co ##vid - 19 on the base of the present understanding of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v infections , which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for combat ##ing the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is a new human corona ##virus candidate recently detected in china that is now reported in people on inhabited continents . the virus shares a high level of identity with some bat corona ##virus ##es and is recognised as a potentially zoo ##not ##ic virus . we are utilizing the one health concept to understand the emergence of the virus , as well as to point to some possible control strategies that might reduce the spread of the virus across the globe ; thus , containment of such virus would be possible .  
abstract one of the great challenges in the ecology of infectious diseases is to understand what drives the emergence of new pathogen ##s including the relationship between viruses and their hosts . in the case of the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , several studies have shown corona ##virus diversity in bats as well as the existence of sar ##s - co ##v infection in apparently healthy bats , suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease . to el ##uc ##ida ##te the bio ##ge ##ographic origin of sar ##s - co ##v and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence , we amplified corona ##virus sequences from bat species captured throughout thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published corona ##virus sequences . to this end , rd ##rp sequence of corona ##vir ##inae was targeted by rt - pc ##r in non - invasive samples from bats collected in thailand . two new corona ##virus ##es were detected in two bat species : one beta ##cor ##ona ##virus in hip ##po ##side ##ros la ##rva ##tus and one alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus in hip ##po ##side ##ros arm ##iger . interesting ##ly , these viruses from south - east asia are related to those previously detected in africa ( beta ##cor ##ona ##virus - b ) or in europe ( alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus & beta ##cor ##ona ##virus - b ) . these findings ill ##umi ##nate the origin and the evolutionary history of the sar ##s - co ##v group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus spill - over from hip ##po ##side ##rid ##ae to rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae and then from rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae to ci ##vet ##s and human . all reported beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es - b ( sar ##s - co ##v group ) of hip ##po ##side ##rid ##ae and rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sy ##mp ##at ##ry of their hosts , which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of beta ##cor ##ona ##virus - b clusters in these families . moreover , despite its probable pathogen ##ici ##ty , we found that a beta ##cor ##ona ##virus - b can persistent ##ly in ##fect a medium - sized hip ##po ##side ##rid bat colony . these findings illustrate the importance of the host ph ##yl ##ogen ##y and the host / pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence . the host ’ s ph ##yl ##ogen ##y , bio ##ge ##ography and behaviour , combined with already described roles of pathogen plastic ##ity and ant ##hr ##op ##ic changes are likely to be co - factors of disease emergence . el ##uc ##ida ##ting the common ancestor of hip ##po ##side ##rid ##ae and rhino
abstract background the rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities . the aim of this study was to develop and valid ##ate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection in patients who have developed pneumonia . methods a two - center , retrospective case – control study was performed . a total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for mer ##s - co ##v infection by real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) between september 1 , 2012 and june 1 , 2016 at king abdul ##azi ##z medical city in ri ##yad ##h and king fa ##had general hospital in jed ##dah , were included . according to the rr ##t - pc ##r results , 135 patients were positive for mer ##s - co ##v and 225 were negative . demographic characteristics , clinical presentations , and radio ##logical and laboratory findings were collected for each subject . results a risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of mer ##s - co ##v was developed . the model included male sex , contact with a sick patient or camel , diabetes , severe illness , low white blood cell ( wb ##c ) count , low alan ##ine amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( alt ) , and high as ##par ##tate amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( as ##t ) . the model performed well in predicting mer ##s - co ##v infection ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curves ( au ##c ) 0 . 81 ##6 ##2 ) , on internal validation ( au ##c 0 . 80 ##37 ) , and on a goodness - of - fit test ( p = 0 . 59 ##2 ) . the risk prediction model , which produced an optimal probability cut - off of 0 . 33 , had a sensitivity of 0 . 71 ##6 and specific ##ity of 0 . 78 ##3 . conclusions this study provides a simple , practical , and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of mer ##s - co ##v infection . this risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of mer ##s - co ##v infection . further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective co ##hort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary .  
infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) could be as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or cause mild influenza - like illness . therefore , the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v infections in the general population could be under ##est ##imated , which nec ##ess ##itate ##s active surveillance to determine the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological importance of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic cases . the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various ser ##ological ass ##ays and to estimate the ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibodies in high - and low - risk groups in qatar . a total of 48 ##58 samples were screened , including 47 ##19 samples collected from healthy blood donors ( b ##d ) over a period of five years ( 2012 - 2016 ) , 135 samples from baseline case contacts ( cc ) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive pc ##r - confirmed patients ( cp ) , and four samples from mer ##s - co ##v cp . initial screening using anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg ( i ##gg rs ##1 - elisa kit ) revealed ten reactive samples from b ##d ( 10 / 47 ##19 , 0 . 21 % ) , one from cc ( 1 / 135 , 0 . 74 % ) , and three from cp ( 3 / 4 , 75 % ) . samples from cp but not from b ##d were also reactive by whole - virus anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg ( n = 3 / 4 ) and i ##gm ( n = 1 / 4 ) indirect immune ##fl ##uo ##res ##cent tests ( ii ##ft ) and pseudo ##par ##tic ##le neutral ##ization test ( pp ##nt ) . the reactive sample from cc was also confirmed by pp ##nt . surprisingly , one out of thirteen ( 7 . 7 % ) randomly selected i ##gg rs ##1 - elisa - negative b ##d samples from the initial screening was reactive by the i ##gm - ii ##ft ( but not by the i ##gg - ii ##ft ) and was subsequently confirmed by pp ##nt . all i ##gg rs ##1 - elisa - reactive samples from b ##d exhibited considerable react ##ivity to the four circulating human corona ##virus ##es ( hk ##u ##1 , o ##c ##43 , 229 ##e , and nl ##6 ##3 ) . cross - react ##ivity with sar ##s was only reported for samples from cp using i ##gg and i ##gm - ii ##ft . in conclusion , we report a low prevalence of anti - mer ##s antibodies in the general population , which coincide ##s with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study ( 2017 ) in qatar ( n = 21 ) . the false - positive results
abstract in february , a new av ##ian h ##5 ##n ##1 / 03 virus took two persons ' lives in hong kong . after this incidence , a newly emerged disease has been identified , associated with pneumonia in infected patients . here we report that a newly discovered co ##ron ##oa ##virus ( co ##v ) is responsible for this disease . in addition , the basic features , diagnosis and possible animal sources of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v are also discussed .  
abstract corona ##virus 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) is responsible for the cleavage of corona ##vira ##l poly ##pro ##tein 1a / 1a ##b ( pp ##1 ##a / 1a ##b ) to produce the mature non - structural proteins ( ns ##ps ) of ns ##p ##4 – 16 . the ns ##p ##5 of the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was identified as 3 ##cl ##pro and its canonical cleavage sites ( between ns ##ps ) were predicted based on sequence alignment , but the cl ##ea ##va ##bility of these cleavage sites remains to be experimental ##ly confirmed and put ##ative non - canonical cleavage sites ( inside one ns ##p ) within the pp ##1 ##a / 1a ##b await ##s further analysis . here , we proposed a method for predicting corona ##vira ##l 3 ##cl ##pro cleavage sites which balance ##s the prediction accuracy and false positive outcomes . by applying this method to mer ##s - co ##v , the 11 canonical cleavage sites were readily identified and verified by the bio ##chemical ass ##ays . the michael ##is constant of the canonical cleavage sites of mer ##s - co ##v showed that the substrate specific ##ity of mer ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro is relatively conserved . interesting ##ly , nine put ##ative non - canonical cleavage sites were predicted and three of them could be cl ##ea ##ved by mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##5 . these results pa ##ve the way for identification and functional characterization of new ns ##p products of corona ##virus ##es .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causes lethal disease in humans , which is characterized by ex ##ace ##rba ##ted inflammatory response and extensive lung pathology . to address the relevance of small non - coding rna ##s in sar ##s - co ##v pathology , we deep sequence ##d rna ##s from the lungs of infected mice and discovered three 18 – 22 nt small viral rna ##s ( sv ##rna ##s ) . the three sv ##rna ##s were derived from the ns ##p ##3 ( sv ##rna - ns ##p ##3 . 1 and - ns ##p ##3 . 2 ) and n ( sv ##rna - n ) gen ##omic regions of sar ##s - co ##v . bio ##genesis of co ##v sv ##rna ##s was rna ##se iii , cell type , and host species independent , but it was dependent on the extent of viral replication . ant ##ago ##mir - mediated inhibition of sv ##rna - n significantly reduced in vivo lung pathology and pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine expression . taken together , these data indicate that sv ##rna ##s contribute to sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and highlight the potential of sv ##rna - n ant ##ago ##mir ##s as anti ##vira ##ls .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) presents an ideal example for developing one health concepts . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the principal reservoir for the virus . infected camel ##s shed the virus in body secret ##ions , particularly nasal discharge ##s . mer ##s - co ##v has the potential to remain active in the environment for some time under opt ##imum conditions of temperature and humidity . this shed ##ding sustain ##s the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camel ##s is considered a major risk factor for human infection . reducing virus shed ##ding from camel ##s will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection . our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shed ##ding from camel ##s to the environment , thereby reducing the possibility of human infection . we will focus on the potential roles of camel markets , camel shows , import ##ation , transportation and grazing in the amp ##li ##fication and shed ##ding of the virus , providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the mer ##s - co ##v .  
summary the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012 . no anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies or vaccines are available for its treatment or prop ##hyl ##ax ##is . approaches to the development of mer ##s vaccines are discussed here ##in , including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non - human corona ##virus ##es . a striking feature of mer ##s is the important role that camel ##s have in transmission . camel va ##cci ##nation may be a novel approach to preventing human infection .  
abstract in august 2015 , the corona outbreak caused by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was the 9th episode since june 2012 in saudi arabia . little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease . the aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in ri ##yad ##h toward the mer ##s - co ##v . in this cross - sectional survey , a self - ad ##mini ##stra ##ted question ##naire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in ri ##yad ##h . the question ##naire contained me ##asurable ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical mer ##s - co ##v knowledge level variables and relevant source of information . the study included 67 ##6 participants . mean age was 32 . 5 ( ± ##sd 8 . 6 ) years and 35 ##3 ( 47 . 8 % ) were males . almost all participants heard about the corona disease and ca ##usa ##tive agent . the study showed a fair overall knowledge ( 66 . 0 % ) , less knowledge on ep ##ide ##mi ##ological features of the disease ( 58 . 3 % ) , and good knowledge ( 90 . 7 % ) on the clinical manifestation of the mer ##s - co ##v . internet was the major ( 89 . 0 % ) source of disease information , and other sources including health care providers , sms , television , magazines and books were low rated ( all < 25 % ) . in a multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression analysis age ≤ ##30 years ( odds ratio ( or ) = 1 . 64 ##7 , 95 % ci 1 . 04 ##8 – 2 . 58 ##4 , p = 0 . 03 ##0 ) , male gender ( or = 1 . 53 ##6 , 95 % ci 1 . 105 – 2 . 134 , p = 0 . 01 ) , and no tertiary education ( or = 1 . 95 ##7 , 95 % ci 1 . 264 – 3 . 03 ##0 , p = 0 . 00 ##3 ) were independent significant predict ##ors of poor ep ##ide ##mi ##ological knowledge . this study concludes that there was inadequate ep ##ide ##mi ##ological knowledge received by the public and the reliance mostly on the clinical manifestation ##s to recognizing the mer ##s - co ##v disease . comprehensive public health education programs is important to increase awareness of simple ep ##ide ##mi ##ological deter ##mina ##nts of the disease is warrant ##ed .  
abstract in order to enhance the sensitivity of conventional im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y technology for the detection of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( n protein ) , we developed a localized surface pl ##as ##mon coupled flu ##orescence ( l ##sp ##c ##f ) fiber - optic bio ##sen ##sor that combines sandwich im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y with the l ##sp technique . experimental ##ly , a linear relationship between the flu ##orescence signal and the concentration of rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v n ( gs ##t - n ) protein in buffer solution could be observed from 0 . 1 ##pg / ml to 1 ##ng / ml . in addition , the concentration of gs ##t - n protein in dil ##uted serum across a similar range could also be measured . the correlation coefficients ( linear scale ) for these two measurements were 0 . 94 ##6 ##9 and 0 . 96 ##24 , respectively . in comparison with conventional enzyme linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , the detection limit of the l ##sp ##c ##f fiber - optic bio ##sen ##sor for the gs ##t - n protein was improved at least 104 - fold using the same mono ##cl ##onal antibodies . therefore , the l ##sp ##c ##f fiber - optic bio ##sen ##sor shows an ability to detect very low concentration ( [UNK] / ml ) of sar ##s - co ##v n protein in serum . the bio ##sen ##sor should help with the early diagnosis of sar ##s infection .  
abstract more than a decade after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 / 2003 the occurrence of a novel co ##v termed middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) co ##v challenges researchers and public health authorities . to control spread and finally contain novel viruses , rapid identification and subsequent isolation of infected individuals and their contacts is of utmost importance . next to methods for nuclei ##c acid detection , valid ##ated ser ##ological ass ##ays are particularly important as the time ##frame for antibody detection is less restricted . during the sar ##s - co ##v epidemic a wide variety of ser ##ological diagnostic ass ##ays were established using multiple methods as well as different viral antigen ##s . even though the majority of the developed ass ##ays showed high sensitivity and specific ##ity , numerous studies reported on cross - reactive antibodies to antigen ##s from wide - spread common cold associated co ##vs . in order to improve prepared ##ness and responsive ##ness during future outbreak ##s of novel co ##vs , information and problems regarding ser ##ological diagnosis that occurred during the sar ##s - co ##v should be acknowledged . in this review we sum ##mar ##ize the performance of different ser ##ological ass ##ays as well as the app ##lica ##bility of the two main applied antigen ##s ( spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ) used during the sar ##s - co ##v outbreak . we highlight challenges and potential pit ##falls that occur when dealing with a novel emerging corona ##virus like mer ##s - co ##v . in addition we describe problems that might occur when animal sera are tested in ser ##ological ass ##ays for the identification of put ##ative reservoirs . finally , we give a recommendation for a ser ##ological testing scheme and outline necessary improvements that should be implemented for a better prepared ##ness .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a zoo ##not ##ic infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the tissue tr ##op ##ism of sar ##s - co ##v includes not only the lung , but also the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract , kidney and liver . ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the c - type le ##ct ##in cd ##20 ##9 ##l ( also known l - sign ) , and dc - sign bind sar ##s - co ##v , but ace ##2 appears to be the key functional receptor for the virus . there is a prominent innate immune response to sar ##s - co ##v infection , including acute - phase proteins , che ##mo ##kin ##es , inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines and c - type le ##ct ##ins such as mann ##ose - binding le ##ct ##in , which plays a protective role against sar ##s . by contrast there may be a lack of type 1 inter ##fer ##on response . moreover , l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia with decreased numbers of cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells is common during the acute phase . con ##vale ##scent patients have i ##gg - class neutral ##izing antibodies that recognize amino acids 441 – 700 of the spike protein ( s protein ) as the major ep ##ito ##pe .  
abstract to evaluate host su ##sc ##ept ##ibility factors to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , we conducted a retrospective co ##hort study from the single largest exposure event of the 2015 korean mer ##s outbreak . a total of 175 patients were closely exposed to a super - spread ##er , 26 of which were infected ( 14 . 9 % ) . in a multi ##var ##iate analysis , history of auto ##log ##ous stem cell transplant ##ation ( hr , 31 . 151 ; 95 % ci , 5 . 44 ##7 – 178 . 145 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and ta ##chy ##p ##nea at ed ( hr , 4 . 39 ##2 ; 95 % ci , 1 . 402 – 13 . 76 ##1 ; p = 0 . 01 ##1 ) were significantly associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract antibodies to sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) - specific b cell ep ##ito ##pes might recognize the pathogen and interrupt its adherence to and penetration of host cells . hence , these ep ##ito ##pes could be useful for diagnosis and as vaccine constituents . using the ph ##age - displayed peptide library screening method and pu ##rified fa ##b fragments of im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg fa ##b ) from normal human sera and con ##vale ##scent sera from sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients as targets , 11 b cell ep ##ito ##pes of sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s protein ) and membrane protein ( m protein ) were screened . after a bio ##in ##form ##atics tool was used to analyze these ep ##ito ##pes , four ep ##ito ##pe - based s protein dod ##eca ##pe ##pt ##ides corresponding to the predominant ep ##ito ##pes were chosen for synthesis . their antigen ##ic specific ##ities and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ities were studied in vitro and in vivo . flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry and eli ##sp ##ot analysis of l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes as well as a ser ##olo ##gic analysis of antibody showed that these peptide ##s could trigger a rapid , highly effective , and relatively safe immune response in bal ##b / c mice . these findings might aid development of sar ##s diagnostic ##s and vaccines . moreover , the role of s and m proteins as important surface antigen ##s is confirmed .  
publisher summary pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of the corona ##virus replica ##se poly ##pro ##tein ##s is essential for ongoing viral rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( rna ) synthesis . therefore , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##s - co ##v ) pro ##tea ##ses are attractive targets for the development of anti ##vira ##l drugs to reduce viral replication and pathogen ##ici ##ty . the structure and activity of the corona ##virus 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) has already been el ##uc ##ida ##ted , and the design of inhibitors to 3 ##cl ##pro as therapeutic ##s has been proposed . the chapter discusses sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro inhibitors that include co ##valent inhibitors , non ##co ##valent inhibitors , and inhibitors from screening . sar ##s - co ##v papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) is considered an equally viable target to 3 ##cl ##pro for drug design because both are essential for viral replication . however , pl ##pro has likely not been pursued because of the pau ##city of structural information . several compounds have been identified that have shown inhibitor ##y activity against sar ##s - co ##v . however , no information regarding their mechanism of action or the corresponding target is known . g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin showed inhibitor ##y activity for sar ##s - co ##v replication with ec ##50 = 300 mg / l after virus absorption in ve ##ro cells . some g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin acid derivatives were found to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication in vitro with ec ##50 values ranging from 5 to 50 μ ##m . unfortunately , these compounds show high cy ##to ##to ##xi ##ty .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) first appeared in november 2002 and ultimately resulted in 80 ##9 ##6 probable human infections and 77 ##4 deaths worldwide . by july 2003 , the global outbreak was declared over . a new corona ##virus , sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent ; this virus appeared to have a zoo ##not ##ic origin , as genetically similar corona ##virus ##es have been identified in several animal species . the global response to the outbreak was extensive . within a short period , the pathogen had been identified , new diagnostic tests were developed , surveillance systems were created , infection control and prevention measures were instituted , and transmission among humans stopped . it is unclear if and when person - to - person sar ##s - co ##v transmission will re ##app ##ear . however , procedures have been established by public health organizations , including the world health organization ( who ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , to help guide diagnosis , reporting , surveillance , and prevention .  
novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) is found to cause a large outbreak started from wu ##han since december 2019 in china and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections have been reported with ep ##ide ##mi ##ological link ##age to china in 25 countries until now . we isolated sar ##s - co ##v - 2 from the oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al sample obtained from the patient with the first laboratory - confirmed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in korea . cy ##top ##athic effects of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 in the ve ##ro cell cultures were con ##fl ##uen ##t 3 days after the first blind passage of the sample . corona ##virus was confirmed with spherical particle having a fringe reminiscent of crown on transmission electron microscopy . phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other sar ##s - co ##v - 2 reported from wu ##han .  
abstract the ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . here we show that ace ##2 expression on cell lines co ##rre ##lates with su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v s - driven infection , suggesting that ace ##2 is a major receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . the soluble ec ##to ##dom ##ain of ace ##2 specifically ab ##rogated s - mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors . del ##eti ##on of a major portion of the cy ##top ##las ##mic domain of ace ##2 had no effect on s - driven infection , indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function . our results point to a central role of ace ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cy ##top ##las ##mic domain to receptor function .  
abstract we have previously demonstrated that over - expression of spike protein ( s ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) or its c - terminal subunit ( s ##2 ) is sufficient to induce ap ##op ##tosis in vitro . to further investigate the possible roles of s ##2 in sar ##s - co ##v - induced ap ##op ##tosis and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s , we characterized the host expression profiles induced upon s ##2 over - expression in ve ##ro e ##6 cells by ol ##igo ##nu ##cle ##otide micro ##ar ##ray analysis . possible activation of mitochondrial ap ##op ##to ##tic pathway in s ##2 expressing cells was suggested , as evidenced by the up - regulation of cy ##to ##chrome c and down - regulation of the bc ##l - 2 family anti - ap ##op ##to ##tic members . inhibition of bc ##l - 2 - related anti - ap ##op ##to ##tic pathway was further supported by the dim ##in ##ution of s ##2 - induced ap ##op ##tosis in ve ##ro e ##6 cells over - expressing bc ##l - xl . in addition , modulation of cc ##n e ##2 and cd ##k ##n 1a implied the possible control of cell cycle arrest at g ##1 / s phase . this study is expected to extend our understanding on the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s at a molecular level .  
phylogenetic analyses reveal that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is closely related to a group of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es . however , it remains unclear where the virus comes from and how it was transmitted to humans in the first place . unlike with other zoo ##not ##ic agents such as han ##ta ##virus and arena ##virus , thus far we haven ’ t found a sar ##s virus in animals that is the same as that in humans . fortunately , sar ##s virus has not appeared in humans since 2004 . in contrast , this new virus seems to have stronger transmission capabilities among people . compared to the primary virus in humans , we still know less about whether , what , and how the virus has changed and the effect of the changes for their epidemic ##s in humans . control and prevention of the disease is especially difficult in china and elsewhere if there are infected individuals with no clinical signs .  
human infection with middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is driven by recurring dr ##ome ##dar ##y - to - human spill - over events , leading decision - makers to consider dr ##ome ##dar ##y va ##cci ##nation . dr ##ome ##dar ##y vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results , but gaps in our understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies must be addressed to design and evaluate potential va ##cci ##nation strategies . we aim to bring together existing measures of mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to assess the distribution of infection , highlighting knowledge gaps and implications for animal va ##cci ##nation . we systematically reviewed the published literature on med ##line , em ##base and web of science that reported ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce and / or prevalence of active mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from both cross - sectional and longitudinal studies . 60 studies met our eligibility criteria . qu ##ali ##tative synth ##eses determined that mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce increased with age up to 80 – 100 % in adult dr ##ome ##dar ##ies supporting geographically widespread endemic ##ity of mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies in both the arabian peninsula and countries export ##ing dr ##ome ##dar ##ies from africa . the high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dr ##ome ##dar ##y populations mix should guide further investigation – particularly of dr ##ome ##dar ##y movement – and inform va ##cci ##nation strategy design and evaluation through mathematical modelling .  
summary objectives previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) were based on information from the general population . however , limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) react ##ivation . this study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 react ##ivation . methods clinical records , laboratory results , and chest ct scans were retrospective ##ly reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory - confirmed co ##vid - 19 pneumonia ( i . e . , with throat sw ##ab samples that were positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) who were admitted to z ##hong ##nan hospital of wu ##han university , wu ##han , china , from jan . 8 to feb . 10 , 2020 . results all 55 patients had a history of ep ##ide ##mi ##ological exposure to co ##vid - 19 , and 5 ( 9 % ) patients who discharged from hospital presented with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 react ##ivation . among the 5 reactivated patients , other symptoms were also observed , including fever , cough , sore throat , and fatigue . one of the 5 patients had progressive l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia ( from 1 . 3 to 0 . 56 × 109 cells per l ) and progressive ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##ia ( from 4 . 5 to 18 . 28 × 109 cells per l ) . all 5 reactivated patients presented normal amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se levels . throat sw ##ab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , indicating all positive for the virus . conclusions findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for react ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections are associated with a significant mortality rate , and existing drugs show poor efficacy . identifying novel targets / pathways required for mer ##s in ##fect ##ivity is therefore important for developing novel therapeutic ##s . as an enveloped virus , trans ##lo ##cation through the end ##ol ##ys ##osomal system provides one pathway for cellular entry of mer ##s - co ##v . in this context , ca ##2 + - per ##me ##able channels within the end ##ol ##ys ##osomal system regulate both the lu ##mina ##l environment and trafficking events , merit ##ing investigation of their role in regulating processing and trafficking of mer ##s - co ##v . knock ##down of end ##ogen ##ous two - por ##e channels ( t ##pc ##s ) , targets for the ca ##2 + mob ##ili ##zing second messenger na ##ad ##p , impaired in ##fect ##ivity in a mer ##s - co ##v spike pseudo ##virus particle trans ##lo ##cation ass ##ay . this effect was selective as knock ##down of the l ##ys ##osomal cat ##ion channel mu ##col ##ip ##in - 1 ( tr ##pm ##l ##1 ) was without effect . ph ##arm ##aco ##logical inhibition of na ##ad ##p - ev ##oked ca ##2 + release using several bis ##ben ##zy ##lis ##o ##quin ##olin ##e al ##kal ##oids also blocked mer ##s pseudo ##virus trans ##lo ##cation . knock ##down of t ##pc ##1 ( biased end ##osomal ##ly ) or t ##pc ##2 ( biased l ##ys ##osomal ##ly ) decreased the activity of fur ##in , a pro ##tea ##se which facilitates mer ##s fusion with cellular membranes . ph ##arm ##aco ##logical or genetic inhibition of t ##pc ##1 activity also inhibit ##ed end ##osomal mo ##tility imp ##air ##ing pseudo ##virus progression through the end ##ol ##ys ##osomal system . overall , these data support a selective , spatial ##ly autonomous role for t ##pc ##s within acidic organ ##elles to support mer ##s - co ##v trans ##lo ##cation .  
background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) caused multiple outbreak ##s . such outbreak ##s increase economic and infection control burden ##s . we studied the infection control influence of mer ##s - co ##v using a hospital - based analysis . methods our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of mer ##s - co ##v between april 1 , 2013 , and june 3 , 2013 . the study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves , surgical masks , n ##9 ##5 res ##pi ##rator ##s , alcohol - based hand san ##iti ##zer , and soap , as well as hand hygiene compliance rates . results during the study , the use of personal protective equipment during mer ##s - co ##v compared with the ##per ##io ##d before mer ##s - co ##v increased dramatically from 2 , 94 ##7 . 4 to 10 , 283 . 9 per 1 , 000 patient - days ( p < . 000 ##00 ##01 ) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1 , 000 patient - days ( p < . 000 ##00 ##01 ) for n ##9 ##5 masks . the use of alcohol - based hand san ##iti ##zer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount ( p < . 000 ##00 ##01 ) . hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 73 % just before the occurrence of the first mer ##s case to 88 % during mer ##s cases ( p = . 000 ##1 ) . the monthly added cost was $ 16 , 400 for included infection control items . conclusions there was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks , res ##pi ##rator ##s , soap and alcohol - based hand san ##iti ##zers . such an increase is a challenge and adds cost to the healthcare system .  
abstract infection of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) induced a strong anti - nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( anti - n ) antibody response . however , the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logical significance of the anti - n antibodies in sar ##s pathogen ##esis is largely unknown . to profile the anti - n antibodies , a ph ##age - displayed sc ##f ##v library was prepared from mice im ##mun ##ized with heat - inactivated sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cell l ##ys ##ate . specific anti - n sc ##f ##vs were isolated by pan ##ning against a rec ##om ##bina ##nt nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein and react ##ivity was confirmed with ph ##age - elisa . sequence analysis indicated that two of the isolated anti - n sc ##f ##v clones were identical and displayed a high homo ##logy with an sc ##f ##v specific for inter ##le ##uki ##n 11 ( il - 11 ) , an anti - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine derived from bone marrow st ##rom ##a cells . in a neutral ##ization ass ##ay , il - 11 - induced stat 3 ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation in rat int ##estinal ep ##ith ##elial iec - 18 cells was completely suppressed by the anti - n sc ##f ##v clone l ##9 ##n ##01 .  
summary clinical challenges exist in the management of hospitalized patients returning to the uk with potential middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection , particularly with its clinical overlap with influenza , as demonstrated in this case - series and cost - analysis review of returning ha ##j ##j pilgrims . these patients were hospitalized with acute feb ##ril ##e respiratory illness , initially managed as potential mer ##s - co ##v infections , but were eventually diagnosed with influenza . additional costs were small , yet enhanced infection prevention measures created significant burden ##s on isolation rooms and staff time . planning for predictable events such as ha ##j ##j is important for resource management . here , in - house mer ##s - co ##v diagnostic testing would have facilitated earlier diagnosis and discharge .  
facing the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , high - volume respiratory testing is demanded in laboratories worldwide . we evaluated the performance of a molecular ass ##ay for the detection of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 on a high - through ##put platform , the co ##bas 680 ##0 , using the ‘ open channel ’ for integration of a laboratory - developed ass ##ay . we observed good analytical performance in clinical specimens . the fully automated work ##flow enables high - through ##put testing with minimal hands - on time , while offering fast and reliable results .  
abstract serum levels of i ##gg , i ##gm and i ##ga against severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were detected serial ##ly with the use of im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent antibody ass ##ays in 30 patients with sar ##s . ser ##oco ##n ##version for i ##gg ( mean 10 days ) occurred simultaneously , or 1 day earlier , than that for i ##gm and i ##ga ( mean 11 days for both ) . i ##gg could be detected as early as 4 days after the onset of illness . the earliest time at which these three antibodies reached peak levels was similar ( mean 15 days ) . a high i ##gg level ( 1 : 800 ) could persist for > 3 months . the kinetic ##s of neutral ##isation antibodies obtained with 100 ##× the tissue culture in ##fect ##ive dose ( tc ##id ##50 ) of the sar ##s - co ##v t ##w ##1 strain in five patients with sar ##s nearly parallel ##ed those for i ##gg . there were no significant differences in the kinetic ##s of the i ##gg , i ##gm and i ##ga responses between patients with or without underlying medical disease , ste ##roid or intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin therapy , or mechanical ventilation .  
abstract eight accessory proteins have been identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . they are believed to play roles in the viral life cycle and may contribute to the pathogen ##esis and vi ##ru ##lence . or ##f ##9 ##b as one of these accessory proteins is located in sub ##gen ##omic mrna ##9 and en ##codes a 98 amino acid protein . however , whether 9 ##b protein is a structural component of sar ##s - co ##v particles remains unknown . in this study , we demonstrate that 9 ##b protein is translated from bi ##cis ##tron ##ic mrna ##9 via leak ##y rib ##oso ##me scanning and it is incorporated into both virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) and pu ##rified sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s . further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9 ##b protein into v ##lp ##s is dependent upon the co - expression of e and m proteins , but not upon the presence of either s or n protein . our data indicate that 9 ##b protein of sar ##s - co ##v is another vi ##rion - associated accessory protein . this finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the sar ##s - co ##v 9 ##b protein .  
the world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new corona ##virus spreading quickly across china and affecting at least 24 other countries . with almost 65 , 000 infected , a worldwide death toll of at least 137 ##0 ( as of 14 february 2020 ) , and with the potential to affect up to two - thirds of the world population , co ##vid - 19 is considered by the world health organization ( who ) to be a global health emergency . the speed of spread and in ##fect ##ivity of co ##vid - 19 ( also known as wu ##han - 2019 - nc ##ov ) are dramatically exceeding those of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in fact , since september 2012 , the who has been notified of 249 ##4 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with mer ##s - co ##v , whereas the 2002 – 2003 epidemic of sar ##s affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 800 ##0 cases . therefore , although sar ##s , mer ##s , and co ##vid - 19 are all the result of corona ##vira ##l infections , the causes of the corona ##virus ##es differ dramatically in their trans ##mis ##sibility . it is likely that these differences in in ##fect ##ivity of corona ##virus ##es can be attributed to the differences in the rigid ##ity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder pre ##dis ##position of the corresponding viral proteins .  
abstract several small animal models have been developed for the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) replication and pathogen ##esis . syrian golden ham ##sters are among the best small animal models , though little clinical illness and no mortality are observed after virus infection . cy ##cl ##op ##hos ##pha ##mide was used to im ##mun ##os ##up ##press ham ##sters leading to a prolonged disease course and higher mortality after sar ##s - co ##v infection . in addition , there was a significant weight loss , expanded tissue tr ##op ##ism , and increased viral pathology in the lung , heart , kidney , and nasal tu ##rbin ##ate tissues . infection with rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v viruses bearing disruption ##s in the gene 7 coding region showed no significant change in replication kinetic ##s , tissue tr ##op ##ism , mor ##bid ##ity , or mortality suggesting that the or ##f ##7 ##a ( 7 ##a ) and or ##f ##7 ##b ( 7 ##b ) proteins are not required for virus replication in im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed ham ##sters . this modified ham ##ster model may provide a useful tool for sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis studies , evaluation of anti ##vira ##l therapy , and analysis of additional sar ##s - co ##v mutants .  
abstract study objective in the absence of reliable rapid confirm ##atory tests during severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) endemic ##s , we designed a 2 - phase co ##hort study to establish a scoring system for sar ##s and to evaluate whether it could improve the sensitivity and specific ##ity of the world health organization ( who ) criteria . methods according to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the who criteria ( 20 confirmed as cases of sar ##s ) in 3 university teaching hospitals in taipei between march 1 and april 20 , 2003 , the scoring system for sar ##s was designed by multi ##var ##iate analysis and step ##wise log ##istic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters . we thereafter applied the scoring system for sar ##s to the consecutive 232 patients ( the validation group ) who met the who criteria of suspected cases from april 21 to may 22 , 2003 . final diagnosis of sar ##s was determined by the results of real - time polymer ##ase chain reaction and paired serum . results the scoring system for sar ##s was defined as radio ##graphic findings of multi ##lo ##bar or bilateral infiltrate ##s ( 3 points ) , sp ##ut ##um mono ##cy ##te pre ##dom ##ina ##nce ( 3 points ) , l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yt ##open ##ia ( 2 points ) , history of exposure ( 1 point ) , lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase more than 450 u / l ( 1 point ) , c - reactive protein more than 5 . 0 mg / dl ( 1 point ) , and activated partial pro ##th ##rom ##bin time more than 40 seconds ( 1 point ) . of the validation group , 60 patients ( group a ) were confirmed as having cases of sar ##s , and the other 172 ( group b ) patients tested negative for sar ##s . the total points of the scoring system for sar ##s at initial presentation were significantly higher in the sar ##s group ( median 9 ; range 6 to 11 ) than in the non - sar ##s group ( median 4 ; range 3 to 7 ; p < . 001 ) . at the cut ##off value of 6 points , the sensitivity and specific ##ity of the scoring system for sar ##s in dia ##gno ##sing sar ##s were 100 % and 93 % , respectively . the positive and negative predict ##ive values of the scoring system for sar ##s were 83 % and 100 % , respectively . conclusion the scoring system for sar ##s can provide a rapid and reliable clinical decision to help emergency physicians detect cases of sar ##s more accurately in the endemic area .  
abstract the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein is a structural component of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and can induce antibody responses in sar ##s patients during infection . however , it is not known whether sar ##s - co ##v n protein can induce a long persistence of memory t - cell response in human . in this study , we found that peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) from fully recovered sar ##s individuals rapidly produced if ##n - γ and il - 2 following stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptide ##s that cover the entire n protein sequence . the n - specific if ##n - γ + cd ##4 + t cells were mainly composed of cd ##45 ##ra ##− ##cc ##r ##7 + cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− cells , whereas if ##n - γ + cd ##8 + memory t cells were mostly contained within cd ##45 ##ra + cc ##r ##7 ##− ##cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− cell population . ep ##ito ##pe mapping study indicated that a cluster of overlapping peptide ##s located in the c - terminal region ( amino acids [ aa ] 331 to 36 ##2 ) of n protein contained at least two different t - cell ep ##ito ##pes . the results indicated that human memory t - cell responses specific for sar ##s - co ##v n protein could persist for 2 years in the absence of antigen , which would be a valuable for the design of effective vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v and for basic studies of human t - cell memory .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new human disease caused by an animal corona ##virus that adapted to efficient human - to - human transmission . the disease first emerged in november 2002 in guangdong province , china and spread globally within months . the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) affects multiple organ systems with severe viral pneumonia as its main clinical manifestation but with dia ##rr ##hea , l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , and mild liver dysfunction being common extra - pulmonary manifestation ##s . increasing age and the presence of underlying respiratory diseases worse ##ns the pro ##gno ##sis . unlike other respiratory viral infections , transmission of sar ##s was less frequent in the first 5 ##day ##s of illness and correlated with low viral load in the upper respiratory tract at this stage of the illness . this fort ##uit ##ous feature of the disease allowed the public health measures of case detection and patient isolation to interrupt virus transmission in the community and ab ##ort the sar ##s outbreak . bats are a reservoir of a virus closely related to sar ##s co ##v and this may be the likely precursor from which the human - adapted sar ##s co ##v emerged . small mammals such as ‘ ci ##vet - cats ’ ( pa ##gum ##a la ##rva ##ta ) within live animal markets in southern china serve as amplifiers of infection and these markets were the likely interface where zoo ##not ##ic transmission occurred . the viral spike protein is necessary and sufficient for inducing protective antibody responses and has been a key target in the development of candidate vaccines .  
the first imported middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) case in china was identified in may 2015 . we determined the kinetic ##s of antibody ( i ##gg and i ##gm ) and neutral ##izing antibodies against mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in this case before discharge . moreover , no ser ##oco ##n ##version was found among 53 close contacts by anti - mer ##s i ##gg antibody enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) of paired serum samples . these findings suggest that neither community nor nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of mer ##s - co ##v occurred in china .  
abstract ser ##ological , molecular and phylogenetic analyses of a recently imported case of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in greece are reported . although mer ##s - co ##v remained detect ##able in the respiratory tract secret ##ions of the patient until the fourth week of illness , vi ##rae ##mia was last detected 2 days after initiation of triple combination therapy with peg ##yla ##ted inter ##fer ##on , rib ##avi ##rin and lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r , administered from day 13 of illness . phylogenetic analysis of the virus showed close similarity with other human mer ##s - co ##vs from the recent jed ##dah outbreak in saudi arabia . im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) ti ##tres peaked 3 weeks after the onset of illness , whilst i ##gm levels remained constantly elevated during the follow - up period ( second to fifth week of illness ) . ser ##ological testing confirmed by virus neutral ##isation ass ##ay detected an additional case that was a close contact of the patient .  
abstract a new system to recognize protein coding genes in the corona ##virus genome ##s , specially suitable for the sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s , has been proposed in this paper . compared with some existing systems , the new program package has the merits of simplicity , high accuracy , reliability , and quick ##ness . the system z ##cu ##r ##ve _ co ##v has been run for each of the 11 newly sequence ##d sar ##s - co ##v genome ##s . consequently , six genome ##s not ann ##ota ##ted previously have been ann ##ota ##ted , and some problems of previous ann ##ota ##tions in the remaining five genome ##s have been pointed out and discussed . in addition to the poly ##pro ##tein chain or ##fs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins , spike ( s ) , small en ##vel ##op ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nu ##le ##oca ##sp ##id ( n ) , respectively , z ##cu ##r ##ve _ co ##v also predict ##s 5 – 6 put ##ative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions . some single nu ##cle ##otide mutations within these put ##ative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are discussed . a web service is provided , by which a user can obtain the ann ##ota ##ted result immediately by past ##ing the sar ##s - co ##v genome sequences into the input window on the web site ( http : / / tub ##ic . t ##ju . ed ##u . cn / sar ##s / ) . the software z ##cu ##r ##ve _ co ##v can also be downloaded freely from the web address mentioned above and run in computers under the platforms of windows or linux .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are increasingly recognized as important respiratory pathogen ##s associated with a broad range of clinical diseases . we sought to increase the insight into clinical ##ly relevant co ##v infections by monitoring antigen concentrations in six confirmed co ##v - positive patients using a newly developed ass ##ay for rapid detection of co ##v o ##c ##43 infections . antigen po ##sit ##ivity lasted 3 to 6 days in secondary infections and 13 days in primary infection . co ##v infections are clinical ##ly diverse , are common , and cannot be diagnosed from clinical symptoms alone .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) caused a severe outbreak in several regions of the world in 2003 . the virus is a novel corona ##virus isolated from patients exhibiting at ##yp ##ical pneumonia and may have originated from wild animals such as ci ##vet cats in southern china . the genome of sar ##s - co ##v is a positive - sense , single - stranded rna whose sequence is distant ##ly related to all known corona ##virus ##es that in ##fect humans and animals . like other known corona ##virus ##es , sar ##s - co ##v is an enveloped virus containing three outer structural proteins , namely the membrane ( m ) , envelope ( e ) , and spike ( s ) proteins . the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein together with the viral rna genome presumably form a he ##lica ##l core located within the viral envelope . the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein is a 42 ##3 amino - acid , predicted ph ##os ##ph ##o - protein of 46 ##k ##da that shares little homo ##logy with other members of the corona ##virus family . a short ser ##ine - rich stretch , and a put ##ative bi ##par ##tite nuclear local ##ization signal are unique to it , thus suggesting its involvement in many important functions during the viral life cycle . in this report we have clone ##d the n gene of the sar ##s corona ##virus , and studied its property of self - association to form dime ##rs . we expressed the n protein as a fusion protein in the yeast two - hybrid system to demonstrate self - association and confirmed dime ##rization of the n protein from mammalian cell l ##ys ##ates by co ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation . furthermore , via del ##eti ##on analysis , we have shown that the c - terminal 209 amino - acid region constitutes the interaction domain responsible for self - association of the n protein to form dime ##rs .  
abstract serious outbreak ##s of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the newly discovered corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v , occurred between late 2002 and early 2003 and there is an urgent need for effective anti ##vira ##l agents . rna interference in animals and post - transcription ##al gene si ##len ##cing plants is mediated by small double - stranded rna molecules named small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) . recently , sir ##na - induced rna interference ( rna ##i ) may provide a new approach to therapy for pathogen ##ic viruses , e . g . hiv and hc ##v . in this study , the si ##len ##cing potential of seven synthetic sir ##nas against sar ##s - co ##v leader , tr ##s , 3 ′ - ut ##r and spike coding sequence have been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of sar ##s - co ##v infection . we demonstrate that sir ##nas directed against spike sequences and the 3 ′ - ut ##r can inhibit the replication of sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro - e ##6 cells , and holds out promise for the development of an effective anti ##vira ##l agent against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es in ##fect many species of animals including humans , causing acute and chronic diseases . this review focuses primarily on the pathogen ##esis of mu ##rine corona ##virus mouse hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) and severe acute respiratory corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . m ##h ##v is a collection of strains , which provide models systems for the study of viral tr ##op ##ism and pathogen ##esis in several organs systems , including the central nervous system , the liver , and the lung , and has been cited as providing one of the few animal models for the study of chronic dem ##ye ##lina ##ting diseases such as multiple sc ##ler ##osis . sar ##s - co ##v emerged in the human population in china in 2002 , causing a worldwide epidemic with severe mor ##bid ##ity and high mortality rates , particularly in older individuals . we review the pathogen ##esis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible . we also review the functions of corona ##virus proteins , structural , en ##zy ##matic , and accessory , with an emphasis on roles in pathogen ##esis . structural proteins in addition to their roles in vi ##rion structure and mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis also contribute significantly to viral spread in vivo and in ant ##ago ##ni ##zing host cell responses . non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins include the small accessory proteins that are not at all conserved between m ##h ##v and sar ##s - co ##v and the 16 conserved proteins encoded in the replica ##se locus , many of which have en ##zy ##matic activities in rna metabolism or protein processing in addition to functions in ant ##ago ##ni ##zing host response .  
there is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown inter ##media ##ry animals in wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china in december 2019 . there have been around 96 , 000 reported cases of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 2019 ) and 330 ##0 reported deaths to date ( 05 / 03 / 2020 ) . the disease is transmitted by in ##hala ##tion or contact with infected droplets and the inc ##uba ##tion period ranges from 2 to 14 d . the symptoms are usually fever , cough , sore throat , breathless ##ness , fatigue , mala ##ise among others . the disease is mild in most people ; in some ( usually the elderly and those with como ##rb ##idi ##ties ) , it may progress to pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and multi organ dysfunction . many people are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic . the case fatal ##ity rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3 % . diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secret ##ions by special molecular tests . common laboratory findings include normal / low white cell counts with elevated c - reactive protein ( cr ##p ) . the computer ##ized tom ##ographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease . treatment is essentially supportive ; role of anti ##vira ##l agents is yet to be established . prevention en ##tails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and drop ##let precautions . the virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the sar ##s - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , but has lower fatal ##ity . the global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain .  
abstract in order to complete the fusion process of sar ##s - co ##v virus , several regions of the s ##2 virus envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein are necessary . recent studies have identified three membrane - active regions in the s ##2 domain of sar ##s - co ##v g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein , one situated downstream of the minimum fur ##in cleavage , which is considered the fusion peptide ( sar ##sf ##p ) , an internal fusion peptide located immediately upstream of the hr ##1 region ( sar ##si ##fp ) and the pre - trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain ( sar ##sp ##tm ) . we have explored the capacity of these selected membrane - interacting regions of the s ##2 sar ##s - co ##v fusion protein , alone or in e ##qui ##mo ##lar mixture ##s , to insert into the membrane as well as to per ##tur ##b the dip ##ole potential of the bi ##layer . we show that the three peptide ##s interact with lip ##id membranes depending on lip ##id composition and experiments using e ##qui ##mo ##lar mixture ##s of these peptide ##s show that different segments of the protein may act in a syn ##er ##gist ##ic way suggesting that several membrane - active regions could participate in the fusion process of the sar ##s - co ##v .  
the worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was caused by a novel corona ##virus called sar ##s - co ##v . corona ##virus ##es and their closest relatives possess extremely large plus - strand rna genome ##s and employ unique mechanisms and enzymes in rna synthesis that separate them from all other rna viruses . the sar ##s epidemic prompted a variety of studies on multiple aspects of the corona ##virus replication cycle , yielding both rapid identification of the entry mechanisms of sar ##s - co ##v into host cells and valuable structural and functional information on sar ##s - co ##v proteins . these recent advances in corona ##virus research have important implications for the development of anti - sar ##s drugs and vaccines .  
abstract with the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in wu ##han , china , in december 2019 , a new corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , aroused the attention of the entire world . the current outbreak of infections with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is termed corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) . the world health organization declared co ##vid - 19 in china as a public health emergency of international concern . two other corona ##virus infections — sar ##s in 2002 - 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in 2012 — both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans . all 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β - corona ##virus ##es . although corona ##virus ##es usually in ##fect the upper or lower respiratory tract , viral shed ##ding in plasma or serum is common . therefore , there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of corona ##virus ##es through the trans ##fusion of lab ##ile blood products . because more and more as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections are being found among co ##vid - 19 cases , considerations of blood safety and corona ##virus ##es have arise ##n especially in endemic areas . in this review , we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s – co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v - 2 through blood products as of february 10 , 2020 , and also discuss pathogen ina ##ct ##ivation methods on corona ##virus ##es .  
abstract we recently established a mouse model ( 288 – 330 + / + ) that developed acute respiratory disease resembling human pathology following infection with a high dose ( 5 × 106 p ##fu ) of mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v ( ic ##mers ##ma ##1 ) . although this high dose conferred fatal respiratory disease in mice , achieving similar pathology at lower viral doses may more closely reflect naturally acquired infections . through continued adaptive evolution of ic ##mers ##ma ##1 we generated a novel mouse - adapted mer ##s - co ##v ( ma ##m ##35 ##c ##4 ) capable of achieving severe respiratory disease at doses between 103 and 105 p ##fu . novel mutations were identified in the ma ##m ##35 ##c ##4 genome that may be responsible for eli ##cit ##ing et ##iol ##og ##ies of acute respiratory distress syndrome at 10 – 1000 fold lower viral doses . importantly , comparative genetics of the two mouse - adapted mer ##s strains allowed us to identify specific mutations that remained fixed through an additional 20 cycles of adaptive evolution . our data indicate that the extent of mer ##s - co ##v adaptation determines the minimal infectious dose required to achieve severe respiratory disease .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged in late 2002 in southern china and rapidly spread to countries around the globe . three research groups within a world health organization ( who ) - coordinated network have independently and simultaneously shown that a novel corona ##virus is linked to sar ##s . a fourth group has completed the koch ' s post ##ulates by in ##fect ##ing monkeys with the agent . sequencing of the complete genome was achieved only weeks after the first isolate of the virus became available .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been one of the most epidemic diseases threatening human health all over the world . based on clinical studies , sar ##s - co ##v ( the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ) , a novel corona ##virus , is reported as the pathogen responsible for the disease . to date , no effective and specific therapeutic method can be used to treat patients suffering from sar ##s - co ##v infection . rna interference ( rna ##i ) is a process by which the introduced small interfering rna ( sir ##na ) could cause the degradation of mrna with identical sequence specific ##ity . the rna ##i methodology has been used as a tool to silence genes in culture ##d cells and in animals . recently , this technique was employed in anti - virus infections in human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus and hepatitis c / b virus . in this study , rna ##i technology has been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of sar ##s - co ##v infection . we constructed specific sir ##nas targeting the s gene in sar ##s - co ##v . we demonstrated that the sir ##nas could effectively and specifically inhibit gene expression of spike protein in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . our study provided evidence that rna ##i could be a tool for inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly lethal emerging disease caused by corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v . new lethal animal models for sar ##s were needed to facilitate anti ##vira ##l research . we adapted and characterized a new strain of sar ##s - co ##v ( strain v ##21 ##6 ##3 ) that was highly lethal in 5 - to 6 - week - old bal ##b / c mice . it had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues . strain v ##21 ##6 ##3 increased il - 1 ##α , il - 6 , mi ##p - 1 ##α , mc ##p - 1 , and ran ##tes in mice , and high il - 6 expression correlated with mortality . the infection largely mimic ##ked human disease , but lung pathology lacked h ##yal ##ine membrane formation . in vitro efficacy against v ##21 ##6 ##3 was shown with known inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v replication . in v ##21 ##6 ##3 - infected mice , amp ##li ##gen ##™ was fully protective , stinging net ##tle le ##ct ##in ( ud ##a ) was partially protective , rib ##avi ##rin was di ##sp ##utable and possibly ex ##ace ##rba ##ted disease , and ep ##12 ##85 ##33 was inactive . rib ##avi ##rin , ud ##a , and amp ##li ##gen ##™ decreased il - 6 expression . strain v ##21 ##6 ##3 provided a valuable model for anti - sar ##s research .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a de novo corona ##virus — mer ##s - co ##v — that is associated with high mortality . however , the mechanism by which mer ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##s humans remains unclear . to date , there is no effective vaccine or antibody for human immunity and treatment , other than the safety and to ##ler ##ability of the fully human poly ##cl ##onal im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin g ( i ##gg ) antibody ( sa ##b - 301 ) as a put ##ative therapeutic agent specific for mer ##s . although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented , new cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection are still being reported . therefore , various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemic ##s in the future . further investigation of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and pathogen ##esis of the virus , as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic anti - mer ##s - co ##v infections , is necessary . for this purpose , detailed information on mer ##s - co ##v proteins is needed . in this review , we describe the major structural and non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural proteins of mer ##s - co ##v and sum ##mar ##ize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v . the combination of computational biology and vi ##rol ##ogy can accelerate the advanced design and development of effective peptide therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v . in summary , this review provides important information about the progress of the elimination of mer ##s , from prevention to treatment .  
abstract the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro ) is vital for sar ##s - co ##v replication and is a promising drug target . it has been extensively proved that only the dime ##ric enzyme is active . here we discovered that two adjacent mutations ( ser ##13 ##9 _ ala and ph ##e ##14 ##0 _ ala ) on the dime ##r interface resulted in completely different crystal structures of the enzyme , demonstrating the distinct roles of these two residues in maintaining the active conform ##ation of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . s ##13 ##9 ##a is a mono ##mer that is structurally similar to the two reported mono ##mers g ##11 ##a and r ##29 ##8 ##a . however , this mutant still retains a small fraction of dime ##r in solution , which might account for its remaining activity . f1 ##40 ##a is a dime ##r with the most collapsed active pocket discovered so far , well - reflecting the stab ##ili ##zing role of this residue . moreover , a plausible dime ##rization mechanism was also de ##duced from structural analysis . our work is expected to provide insight on the dime ##rization – function relationship of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro .  
abstract since discovering the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) as a ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe respiratory illness in the middle east in 2012 , ser ##ological testing has been conducted to assess antibody responses in patients and to investigate the zoo ##not ##ic reservoir of the virus . although the virus neutral ##ization test is the gold standard ass ##ay for mer ##s diagnosis and for investigating the zoo ##not ##ic reservoir , it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories . competitive elisa ( ce ##lis ##a ) , in which a labeled mono ##cl ##onal antibody ( mab ) competes with test serum antibodies for target ep ##ito ##pes , may be a suitable alternative because it detect ##s antibodies in a species - independent manner . in this study , novel mab ##s against the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v were produced and characterized . one of these mab ##s was used to develop a ce ##lis ##a . the ce ##lis ##a detected mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies in sera from mer ##s - co ##v - infected rats and rabbits im ##mun ##ized with the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v . the mab - based ce ##lis ##a was valid ##ated using sera from ethiopian dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . relative to the neutral ##ization test , the ce ##lis ##a detected mer ##s - co ##v - specific antibodies in 66 ethiopian dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s with a sensitivity and specific ##ity of 98 % and 100 % , respectively . the ce ##lis ##a and neutral ##ization test results correlated well ( pearson ’ s correlation coefficients = 0 . 71 – 0 . 76 , depending on the ce ##lis ##a serum dil ##ution ) . this ce ##lis ##a may be useful for mer ##s ep ##ide ##mi ##ological investigations on mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is involved in the path ##ological reaction to sar ##s and is a key antigen for the development of a sensitive diagnostic ass ##ay . however , the antigen ##ic properties of this n protein are largely unknown . to facilitate the studies on the function and antigen ##ici ##ty of the sar ##s - co ##v n protein , 6 ##× his ##ti ##dine - tagged rec ##om ##bina ##nt sar ##s - co ##v n ( rs ##ars - n ) with a molecular mass of 46 and 48 ##k ##da was successfully produced using the rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system in insect cells . the rs ##ars - n expressed in insect cells ( br ##sar ##s - n ) showed remarkably higher specific ##ity and im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity than rs ##ars - n expressed in e . coli ( er ##sar ##s - n ) . most of all , br ##sar ##s - n proteins were expressed as a highly ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated form with a molecular mass of 48 ##k ##da , but er ##sar ##s - n was a non ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated protein . in further analysis to determine the correlation between the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and the antigen ##ici ##ty of sar ##s - n protein , de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated sar ##s - n protein treated with protein ph ##os ##pha ##tase 1 ( pp ##1 ) remarkably enhanced the cross - react ##ivity against sar ##s negative serum and considerably reduced im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity with sar ##s - n mab . these results suggest that the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation plays an important role in the im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity and specific ##ity of sar ##s - n protein . therefore , the br ##sar ##s - n protein may be useful for the development of highly sensitive and specific ass ##ays to determine sar ##s infection and for further research of sar ##s - n pathology .  
abstract this article introduces a series of invited papers in anti ##vira ##l research marking the 10th anniversary of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by a novel corona ##virus that emerged in southern china in late 2002 . until that time , corona ##virus ##es had not been recognized as agents causing severe disease in humans , hence , the emergence of the sar ##s - co ##v came as a complete surprise . research during the past ten years has revealed the existence of a diverse pool of corona ##virus ##es circulating among various bat species and other animals , suggesting that further introductions of highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es into the human population are not merely probable , but inevitable . the recent emergence of another corona ##virus causing severe disease , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , in humans , has made it clear that corona ##virus ##es pose a major threat to human health , and that more research is urgently needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te their replication mechanisms , identify potential drug targets , and develop effective counter ##me ##as ##ures . in this series , experts in many different aspects of corona ##virus replication and disease will provide authoritative , up - to - date reviews of the following topics : – clinical management and infection control of sar ##s ; – reservoir hosts of corona ##virus ##es ; – receptor recognition and cross - species transmission of sar ##s - co ##v ; – sar ##s - co ##v eva ##sion of innate immune responses ; – structures and functions of individual corona ##vira ##l proteins ; – anti - corona ##virus drug discovery and development ; and – the public health legacy of the sar ##s outbreak . each article will be identified in the last line of its abstract as belonging to the series “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ” 
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have a remarkable potential to change tr ##op ##ism . this is particularly illustrated over the last 15 years by the emergence of two zoo ##not ##ic co ##vs , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v . due to their inherent genetic variability , it is inevitable that new cross - species transmission events of these enveloped , positive - stranded rna viruses will occur . research into these medical and veterinary important pathogen ##s — sparked by the sar ##s and mer ##s outbreak ##s — revealed important principles of inter - and intra ##sp ##ec ##ies tr ##op ##ism changes . the primary deter ##mina ##nt of co ##v tr ##op ##ism is the viral spike ( s ) entry protein . trim ##ers of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s on the vi ##rion surface accommodate binding to a cell surface receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane . recently , high - resolution structures of two co ##v s proteins have been el ##uc ##ida ##ted by single - particle cry ##o - electron microscopy . using this new structural insight , we review the changes in the s protein that relate to changes in virus tr ##op ##ism . different concepts under ##lie these tr ##op ##ism changes at the cellular , tissue , and host species level , including the prom ##is ##cuit ##y or adapt ##ability of s proteins to or ##th ##olo ##go ##us receptors , alterations in the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage activation as well as changes in the s protein meta ##sta ##bility . a thorough understanding of the key role of the s protein in co ##v entry is critical to further our understanding of virus cross - species transmission and pathogen ##esis and for development of intervention strategies .  
abstract pro ##te ##omics was used to identify a protein encoded by or ##f 3a in a sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . im ##mun ##o - b ##lot ##ting revealed that inter ##chai ##n di ##sul ##fide bonds might be formed between this protein and the spike protein . elisa indicated that sera from sar ##s patients have significant positive reactions with synthesized peptide ##s derived from the 3a protein . these results are concord ##ant with that of a spike protein - derived peptide . a tendency exists for co - mutation between the 3a protein and the spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s , suggesting that the function of the 3a protein co ##rre ##lates with the spike protein . taken together , the 3a protein might be tightly correlated to the spike protein in the sar ##s - co ##v functions . the 3a protein may serve as a new clinical marker or drug target for sar ##s treatment .  
abstract background there ’ s an outbreak of a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection since december 2019 , first in china , and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till march 2 , 2020 . identification , isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human - to - human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers , preventing transmission amp ##li ##fication events . the rt - pc ##r detection of viral nuclei ##c acid test ( nat ) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pan ##de ##mic , just as in this co ##vid - 19 outbreak . methods 48 ##80 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with co ##vid - 19 patients in hospital in wu ##han , china , were tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection by use of quantitative rt - pc ##r ( q ##rt - pc ##r ) on samples from the respiratory tract . positive rates were calculated in groups divided by gender ##s or ages . results the positive rate was about 38 % for the total 48 ##80 specimens . male and older population had a significant higher positive rates . however , 57 % was positive among the specimens from the fever clinics . binary log ##istic regression analysis showed that age , not gender , was the risk factor for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection in fever clinics . conclusions therefore , we concluded that viral nat played an important role in identifying sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) led to a life - threatening form of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia in late 2002 . following that , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has recently emerged , killing about 36 % of patients infected globally , mainly in saudi arabia and south korea . based on a sc ##af ##fold we reported for inhibit ##ing ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e ( na ) , we synthesized the analogue ##s and identified compounds with low micro ##mo ##lar inhibitor ##y activity against 3 ##cl ##pro of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . docking studies show that a car ##box ##yla ##te present at either r ##1 or r ##4 des ##ta ##bil ##izes the ox ##yan ##ion hole in the 3 ##cl ##pro . interesting ##ly , 3 ##f , 3 ##g and 3 ##m could inhibit both na and 3 ##cl ##pro and serve as a starting point to develop broad - spectrum anti ##vira ##l agents .  
summary the outbreak of sar ##s warrant ##s the search for anti ##vira ##l compounds to treat the disease . at present , no specific treatment has been identified for sar ##s - associated corona ##virus infection . we assessed the anti ##vira ##l potential of rib ##avi ##rin , 6 - az ##aur ##idi ##ne , p ##yra ##zo ##fur ##in , my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid , and g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin against two clinical isolate ##s of corona ##virus ( ff ##m - 1 and ff ##m - 2 ) from patients with sar ##s admitted to the clinical centre of frankfurt university , germany . of all the compounds , g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin was the most active in inhibit ##ing replication of the sar ##s - associated virus . our findings suggest that g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin should be assessed for treatment of sar ##s .  
corona ##virus ##es are positive stranded rna viruses that cause respiratory , enter ##ic and central nervous system diseases in many species , including humans . until recently , the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses imp ##eded the development of corona ##virus specific therapeutic ##s . however , the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and more recently , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , has imp ##elled the development of such drugs . this review focuses on some newly identified sar ##s - co ##v inhibitors , with known mechanisms of action and their potential to inhibit the novel mer ##s - co ##v . the clinical development of opt ##imi ##zed versions of such compounds could be beneficial for the treatment and control of sar ##s - co ##v , the current mer ##s - co ##v and other future sar ##s - like epidemic ##s .  
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in september 2012 in saudi arabia had attracted the attention of the global health community . in 2017 the saudi ministry of health released a visual tri ##age system with scoring to alert healthcare workers in emergency departments ( eds ) and ha ##em ##od ##ial ##ysis units for the possibility of occurrence of mer ##s - co ##v infection . we performed a retrospective analysis of this visual score to determine its sensitivity and specific ##ity . the study included all cases from 2014 to 2017 in a mer ##s - co ##v refer ##ral centre in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia . during the study period there were a total of 243 ##5 suspected mer ##s cases . of these , 1823 ( 75 % ) tested negative and the remaining 25 % tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v by pc ##r ass ##ay . the application of the visual tri ##age score found a similar percentage of mer ##s - co ##v and non – mer ##s - co ##v patients , with each score from 0 to 11 . the percentage of patients with a cut ##off score of ≥ ##4 was 75 % in patients with mer ##s - co ##v infection and 85 % in patients without mer ##s - co ##v infection ( p 0 . 000 ##1 ) . the sensitivity and specific ##ity of this cut ##off score for mer ##s - co ##v infection were 74 . 1 % and 18 . 6 % , respectively . the sensitivity and specific ##ity of the scoring system were low , and further ref ##ine ##ment of the score is needed for better prediction of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
summary the past decade has seen the emergence of several novel viruses that cause respiratory tract infections in human beings , including middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in saudi arabia , an h ##7 ##n ##9 influenza a virus in eastern china , a sw ##ine - like influenza h ##3 ##n ##2 variant virus in the usa , and a human aden ##ov ##irus 14 ##p ##1 also in the usa . mer ##s - co ##v and h ##7 ##n ##9 viruses are still a major worldwide public health concern . the pathogen ##esis and mode of transmission of mer ##s - co ##v and h ##7 ##n ##9 influenza a virus are poorly understood , making it more difficult to implement intervention and prevent ##ive measures . a united and coordinated global response is needed to tackle emerging viruses that can cause fatal respiratory tract infections and to fill major gaps in the understanding of the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and transmission dynamics of these viruses .  
abstract in march 2003 , a novel corona ##virus was isolated from patients exhibiting at ##yp ##ical pneumonia and subsequently proven to be the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the disease now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the complete genome of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has since been sequence ##d . the sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( sar ##s - co ##v n ) shares little homo ##logy with other members of the corona ##virus family . to determine if the n protein is involved in the regulation of cellular signal trans ##duction , an elisa - based ass ##ay on transcription factors was used . we found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c - f ##os , at ##f ##2 , cr ##eb - 1 , and f ##os ##b was increased by the expression of sar ##s - co ##v n . since these factors are related to ap - 1 signal trans ##duction pathway , we investigated whether the ap - 1 pathway was activated by sar ##s - co ##v n protein using the path ##de ##tec ##t system . the results demonstrated that the expression of n protein , not the membrane protein ( m ) , activated ap - 1 pathway . we also found that sar ##s - co ##v n protein does not activate n ##f - κ ##b pathway , demonstrating that activation of important cellular pathways by sas - co ##v n protein is selective . thus our data for the first time indicate that sar ##s - co ##v has encoded a strategy to regulate cellular signaling process .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a member of the corona ##vir ##idae family , is the ca ##usa ##tive pathogen for mer ##s that is characterized by high fever , pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) , as well as extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry manifestation ##s . currently , there are no approved treatment regime ##ns or vaccines for mer ##s . here , we generated rec ##om ##bina ##nt non ##vir ##ulent newcastle disease virus ( n ##d ##v ) las ##ota strain expressing mer ##s - co ##v s protein ( designated as r ##la - mer ##s - s ) , and evaluated its im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity in mice and ba ##ct ##rian camel ##s . the results revealed that r ##la - mer ##s - s showed similar growth properties to those of las ##ota in embryo ##nated chicken eggs , while animal im ##mun ##ization studies showed that r ##la - mer ##s - s induced mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies in mice and camel ##s . our findings suggest that rec ##om ##bina ##nt r ##la - mer ##s - s may be a potential mer ##s - co ##v veterinary vaccine candidate for camel ##s and other animals affected by mer ##s .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es are the et ##iol ##ogical agents of respiratory and enter ##ic diseases in humans and livestock , exemplified by the life - threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . however , effective means for combat ##ing corona ##virus ##es are still lacking . the interaction between non ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural protein ( ns ##p ) 10 and ns ##p ##16 has been demonstrated and the crystal structure of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##16 / 10 complex has been revealed . as ns ##p ##10 acts as an essential trigger to activate the 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se activity of ns ##p ##16 , short peptide ##s derived from ns ##p ##10 may have inhibitor ##y effect on viral 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se activity . in this study , we revealed that the domain of aa 65 – 107 of ns ##p ##10 was sufficient for its interaction with ns ##p ##16 and the region of aa 42 – 120 in ns ##p ##10 , which is larger than the interaction domain , was needed for stimulating the ns ##p ##16 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se activity . we further showed that two short peptide ##s derived from the interaction domain of ns ##p ##10 could inhibit the 2 ′ - o - methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se activity of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##16 / 10 complex , thus providing a novel strategy and proof - of - principle study for developing peptide inhibitors against sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is the first major zoo ##not ##ic infectious disease of the twenty - first century . the disease , originally termed “ at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , ” was first recognized in november 2002 in guangdong province , china , which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 80 ##9 ##6 human infection cases and 77 ##4 deaths . a previously un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed corona ##virus , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was later identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the sar ##s . subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections was most likely originated from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets , with masked palm ci ##vet ##s being considered the most prominent and important carrier . large - scale cu ##lling of ci ##vet ##s appeared to have prevented further outbreak ##s in the region . further ep ##ide ##mi ##ological studies showed that ci ##vet ##s are intermediate hosts of sar ##s - co ##v , and bats are the likely natural reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v and a large number of sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##vs ) . detailed analysis of the massive sar ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequence data accumulated indicated that sar ##s - co ##v experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission from animals to humans . the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) of sar ##s - co ##v plays a key role in virus – host interaction and hence is a key deter ##mina ##nt of inter ##sp ##ec ##ies transmission . it has been shown that minor changes of amino acid ( aa ) residues in the s protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus su ##sc ##ept ##ibility in animal and human hosts . this chapter will focus on the genetics and evolution of sar ##s - co ##vs and sl - co ##vs in humans , ci ##vet ##s , and bats . the events of sar ##s outbreak ##s and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broad ##en the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently recognized feb ##ril ##e respiratory illness that first appeared in southern china in november 2002 , has since spread to several countries , and has resulted in more than 800 ##0 cases and more than 750 deaths . the disease has been et ##iol ##ogical ##ly linked to a novel corona ##virus that has been named the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus . it appears to be spread primarily by large drop ##let transmission . there is no specific therapy , and management consists of supportive care . this article sum ##mar ##izes currently available information regarding the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical features , et ##iol ##og ##ic agent , and modes of transmission of the disease , as well as infection control measures appropriate to contain sar ##s .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 7 ##a is an accessory protein with no known homo ##logue ##s . in this study , we report the interaction of a sar ##s - co ##v 7 ##a and small g ##lu ##tam ##ine - rich te ##tra ##tric ##ope ##pt ##ide repeat - containing protein ( sgt ) . sar ##s - co ##v 7 ##a and human sgt interaction was identified using a two - hybrid system screen and confirmed with interaction screens in cell culture and cellular co - local ##ization studies . the sgt domain of interaction was mapped by del ##eti ##on mutant analysis and results indicated that te ##tra ##tric ##ope ##pt ##ide repeat 2 ( aa 125 - 158 ) was essential for interaction . we also showed that 7 ##a interact ##ed with sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins m ( membrane ) and e ( envelope ) , which have been shown to be essential for virus - like particle formation . taken together , our results coupled with data from studies of the interaction between sgt and hiv - 1 vp ##u indicated that sgt could be involved in the life - cycle , possibly assembly of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract background severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a life - threatening form of pneumonia caused by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . from late 2002 to mid 2003 , it infected more than 800 ##0 people worldwide , of which a majority of cases were found in china . owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic western medicines , ho ##ut ##tu ##yn ##ia cord ##ata th ##un ##b . ( sa ##uru ##race ##ae ) ( hc ) was shortlisted by chinese scientists to tackle sar ##s problem as it is conventional ##ly used to treat pneumonia . aim of the study the present study aimed to explore the sar ##s - preventing mechanisms of hc in the im ##mun ##ological and anti - viral aspects . results results showed that hc water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse sp ##len ##ic l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes significantly and dose - dependent ##ly . by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry , it was revealed that hc increased the proportion of cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells . moreover , it caused a significant increase in the secret ##ion of il - 2 and il - 10 by mouse sp ##len ##ic l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes . in the anti - viral aspect , hc exhibited significant inhibitor ##y effects on sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) and rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) . on the other hand , oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that hc was non - toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16 ##g / kg . conclusion the results of this study provided scientific data to support the efficient and safe use of hc to combat sar ##s .  
background : a novel corona ##virus of zoo ##not ##ic origin ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease . this virus is genetically similar to sar ##s corona ##virus and bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es . the outbreak was initially detected in wu ##han , a major city of china , but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of china . travel - associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries . outbreak ##s in health care workers indicate human - to - human transmission . molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients . methods : we developed two 1 - step quantitative real - time reverse - transcription pc ##r ass ##ays to detect two different regions ( or ##f ##1 ##b and n ) of the viral genome . the prime ##r and probe sets were designed to react with this novel corona ##virus and its closely related viruses , such as sar ##s corona ##virus . these ass ##ays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls . in addition , respiratory specimens from two 2019 - nc ##ov - infected patients were tested . results : using rna extracted from cells infected by sar ##s corona ##virus as a positive control , these ass ##ays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude ( 2 ##x ##10 - 4 - 2000 tc ##id ##50 / reaction ) . using dna pl ##as ##mi ##ds as positive standards , the detection limits of these ass ##ays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction . all negative control samples were negative in the ass ##ays . samples from two 2019 - nc ##ov - infected patients were positive in the tests . conclusions : the established ass ##ays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019 ##n - co ##v in human samples , thereby allowing early identification of patients .  
emerge ##nt corona ##virus ##es such as mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v can cause significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in infected individuals . lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission . animal models are often required to study viral infections and the ##ra ##pies , especially during an initial outbreak . his ##top ##ath ##ology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogen ##esis and clarify effective the ##ra ##pies . use of im ##mun ##osta ##ining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tr ##op ##ism for cells can be evaluated to co ##rre ##late with lesions . in the lung , lesions and im ##mun ##osta ##ining can be qu ##ali ##tative ##ly described to define the cell types , micro ##ana ##tom ##ic location , and type of changes seen . these features are important and necessary , but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups . semi ##qua ##nti ##tative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistical ##ly compare groups and increase the rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility and rig ##or of the study . this review describes principles , approaches , and resources that can be useful to evaluate corona ##virus lung infection , focusing on mer - co ##v infection as the principal example .  
abstract dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) is a receptor for mer ##s - co ##v . the soluble form of d ##pp ##4 ( sd ##pp ##4 ) ci ##rc ##ulates systematically and can competitive ##ly inhibit mer ##s - co ##v entry into host cells . here , we measured the concentration of sd ##pp ##4 in the plasma and sp ##uta of 14 mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients of various degrees of disease severity . the concentration of sd ##pp ##4 in the plasma of mer ##s patients ( 47 ##4 . 76 ± 108 . 06 ng / ml ) was significantly lower than those of healthy controls ( 70 ##3 . 42 ± 169 . 96 ng / ml ) , but there were no significant differences among the patient groups . interesting ##ly , plasma levels of il - 10 and e ##gf were negatively and positively correlated with sd ##pp ##4 concentrations , respectively . the sd ##pp ##4 levels in sp ##uta were less than 300 ng / ml . viral infection was inhibit ##ed by 50 % in the presence of more than 800 ##0 ng / ml of sd ##pp ##4 . therefore , sd ##pp ##4 levels in the plasma of mer ##s patients are significantly reduced below the threshold needed to ex ##ert an anti ##vira ##l effect against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract the sudden appearance and potential lethal ##ity of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins . here , we assess phylogenetic relationships for the sar ##s - co ##v lineage as well as the history of host - species shifts for sar ##s - co ##v and other corona ##virus ##es . we used a bay ##esian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three sar ##s - co ##v proteins : rna dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and spike ( s ) . conservation of rd ##rp allowed us to use a set of arte ##ri ##vir ##idae taxa to root the corona ##vir ##idae ph ##yl ##ogen ##y . we found strong evidence for a rec ##om ##bina ##tion break ##point within sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp , based on different , well supported trees for a 5 ′ fragment ( supporting sar ##s - co ##v as sister to a clade including all other corona ##virus ##es ) and a 3 ′ fragment ( supporting sar ##s - co ##v as sister to group three av ##ian corona ##virus ##es ) . these different top ##ologies are statistical ##ly significant : the optimal 5 ′ tree could be rejected for the 3 ′ region , and the optimal 3 ′ tree could be rejected for the 5 ′ region . we did not find statistical evidence for rec ##om ##bina ##tion in analyses of n and s , as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees . comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host - species and 36 corona ##virus ##es , representing corona ##virus groups 1 – 3 and sar ##s - co ##v , based on n showed statistical inc ##ong ##ru ##ence indicating multiple host - species shifts for corona ##virus ##es . inference of host - species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously . however , current sampling suggests host - species shifts between mouse and rat , chicken and turkey , mammals and man ##x shear ##water , and humans and other mammals . the sister relationship between av ##ian corona ##virus ##es and the 3 ′ rd ##rp fragment of sar ##s - co ##v suggests an additional host - species shift . demonstration of rec ##om ##bina ##tion in the sar ##s - co ##v lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change , a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious disease with a strong potential for transmission upon close personal contact and is caused by the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . however , there are no natural or synthetic compounds currently available that can inhibit sar ##s - co ##v . we examined the inhibitor ##y effects of 64 pu ##rified natural compounds against the activity of sar ##s he ##lica ##se , ns ##p ##13 , and the hepatitis c virus ( hc ##v ) he ##lica ##se , ns ##3 ##h , by conducting flu ##orescence resonance energy transfer ( fr ##et ) - based double - strand ( ds ) dna un ##wind ##ing ass ##ay or by using a color ##ime ##try - based atp hydro ##lysis ass ##ay . while none of the compounds , examined in our study inhibit ##ed the dna un ##wind ##ing activity or atp ##ase activity of human hc ##v he ##lica ##se protein , we found that my ##rice ##tin and sc ##ute ##llar ##ein potent ##ly inhibit the sar ##s - co ##v he ##lica ##se protein in vitro by affecting the atp ##ase activity , but not the un ##wind ##ing activity , ns ##p ##13 . in addition , we observed that my ##rice ##tin and sc ##ute ##llar ##ein did not exhibit cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city against normal breast ep ##ith ##elial mc ##f ##10 ##a cells . our study demonstrates for the first time that selected naturally - occurring fl ##av ##ono ##ids , including my ##rice ##tin and sc ##ult ##ella ##re ##in might serve as sar ##s - co ##v chemical inhibitors .  
abstract the 3 ′ pro ##xi ##mal one - third of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome en ##codes the structural proteins and eight accessory proteins , including 3a , 3 ##b , 6 , 7 ##a , 7 ##b , 8 ##a , 8 ##b and 9 ##b , varying in length from 39 to 274 ##aa which do not share significant homo ##logy with viral proteins of known corona ##virus ##es . the sar ##s - co ##v protein 6 is 63 amino acids in length and has been previously involved in virus pathogen ##ici ##ty and replication . to further analyze this functions , the interaction of sar ##s - co ##v protein 6 with other viral and / or cellular factors has been analyzed during sar ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##ive cycle . protein 6 im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation from extracts of sar ##s - co ##v infected cells and mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry analysis revealed an interaction of viral proteins 6 and 9 ##b in biological ##ly relevant conditions . this interaction has been reinforced by co - local ##ization of both proteins in the cy ##top ##las ##m of sar ##s - co ##v infected cells .  
abstract infection with the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) induce ##s an at ##yp ##ical pulmonary disease with a high lethal ##ity rate . although the initial sar ##s epidemic was contained , sporadic outbreak ##s of the disease still occur , suggesting a continuous need for a vaccine against this virus . we therefore explored ex ##oso ##me - based vaccines containing the spike s proteins of sar ##s - co ##v . s - containing ex ##oso ##mes were obtained by replacing the trans ##me ##mb ##rane and cy ##top ##las ##mic domains of the s protein by those of vs ##v - g . the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and efficacy of the s - containing ex ##oso ##mes were tested in mice and compared to an aden ##ov ##ira ##l vector vaccine expressing the s protein . both , s - containing ex ##oso ##mes and the aden ##ov ##ira ##l vector vaccine induced neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters . after pri ##ming with the sar ##s - s ex ##osomal vaccine and boost ##ing with the aden ##ov ##ira ##l vector the neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters exceeded those observed in the con ##vale ##scent serum of a sar ##s patient . both approaches were effective in a sar ##s - s - expressing tumor challenge model and thus warrant further investigation .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused by a newly identified corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) remains a threat to cause epidemic ##s as evidenced by recent sporadic cases in china . in this communication , we evaluated the efficacy and safety of two sar ##s vaccine candidates based on the rec ##om ##bina ##nt modified va ##cci ##nia ankara ( mv ##a ) expressing sar ##s - co ##v spike or nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins in fe ##rret ##s . no clinical signs were observed in all the fe ##rret ##s challenged with sar ##s - co ##v . on the other hand , va ##cci ##nation did not prevent sar ##s - co ##v infection in fe ##rret ##s . in contrast , im ##mun ##ized fe ##rret ##s ( particularly those im ##mun ##ized with rm ##va - spike ) exhibited significantly stronger inflammatory responses and focal nec ##rosis in liver tissue after sar ##s - co ##v challenge than control animals . thus , our data suggest that enhanced hepatitis is linked to va ##cci ##nation with rm ##va expressing sar ##s - co ##v antigen ##s .  
abstract the pro - ap ##op ##to ##tic properties of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) structural proteins were studied in vitro . by monitoring ap ##op ##tosis indicators including ch ##rom ##atin conde ##ns ##ation , cellular dna fragmentation and cell membrane as ##ym ##metry , we demonstrated that the aden ##ov ##irus - mediated over - expression of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein and its c - terminal domain ( s ##2 ) induce ap ##op ##tosis in ve ##ro e ##6 cells in a time - and dos ##age - dependent manner , whereas the expression of its n - terminal domain ( s ##1 ) and other structural proteins , including envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein do not . these findings suggest a possible role of s and s ##2 protein in sar ##s - co ##v induced ap ##op ##tosis and the molecular pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
abstract development of effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is still a priority in prevention of re - emergence of sar ##s . our previous studies have shown that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein eli ##cit ##s highly potent neutral ##izing antibody responses in the im ##mun ##ized animals . but it is unknown whether rb ##d can also induce protective immunity in an animal model , a key aspect for vaccine development . in this study , bal ##b / c mice were va ##cci ##nated intra ##mus ##cular ##ly ( i . m . ) with 10 ##μ ##g of rb ##d - fc ( rb ##d fused with human i ##gg ##1 fc ) and boosted twice at 3 - week intervals and one more time at 12th month . humor ##al immune responses of va ##cci ##nated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1 - month interval and the neutral ##izing ti ##ters of produced antibodies were reported at months 0 , 3 , 6 and 12 post - va ##cci ##nation . mice were challenged with the homo ##log ##ous strain of sar ##s - co ##v 5 days after the last boost , and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge . mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load , virus replication and his ##top ##ath ##ological effects . our results showed that rb ##d - fc va ##cci ##nation induced high ti ##ter of s - specific antibodies with long - term and potent sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing activity . four of five va ##cci ##nated mice were protected from subsequent sar ##s - co ##v challenge because no significant virus replication , and no obvious his ##top ##ath ##ological changes were found in the lung tissues of the va ##cci ##nated mice challenged with sar ##s - co ##v . only one va ##cci ##nated mouse had mild al ##ve ##olar damage in the lung tissues . in contrast , high copies of sar ##s - co ##v rna and virus replication were detected , and path ##ological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice . in conclusion , our findings suggest that rb ##d , which can induce protective antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v , may be further developed as a safe and effective sar ##s subunit vaccine .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first discovered in late 2012 and has gone on to cause over 1800 infections and 650 deaths . there are currently no approved therapeutic ##s or va ##cci ##nation ##s for mer ##s - co ##v . the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is responsible for receptor binding and vi ##rion entry to cells , is im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant and induce ##s neutral ##izing antibodies in vivo , all of which , make the s protein an ideal target for anti - mer ##s - co ##v vaccines . in this study , we demonstrate protection induced by va ##cci ##nation with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt mer ##s - co ##v s nano ##par ##tic ##le vaccine and matrix - m1 ad ##ju ##vant combination in mice . the mer ##s - co ##v s nano ##par ##tic ##le vaccine produced high ti ##ter anti - s neutral ##izing antibody and protected mice from mer ##s - co ##v infection in vivo .  
abstract the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 affected thousands of people and an efficient diagnostic system is needed for accurate detection of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) to prevent or limit future outbreak ##s . of the several sar ##s co ##v structural proteins , the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein has been shown to be a good diagnostic marker . in this study , an ss ##dna apt ##ame ##r that specifically binds to sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein was isolated from a dna library containing 45 - nu ##ce ##otide random sequences in the middle of an 88 ##mer single - stranded dna . after twelve cycles of systematic evolution of ligand ##s by exponential enrichment ( se ##le ##x ) procedure , 15 ss ##dna apt ##ame ##rs were identified . enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) analysis was then used to identify the apt ##ame ##r with the highest binding affinity to the sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . using this approach , an ss ##dna apt ##ame ##r that binds to the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein with a k d of 4 . 93 ##± ##0 . 30 ##n ##m was identified . western b ##lot analysis further demonstrated that this ss ##dna apt ##ame ##r could be used to efficiently detect the sar ##s co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein when compared with a nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antibody . therefore , we believe that the selected ss ##dna apt ##ame ##r may be a good alternative detection probe for the rapid and sensitive detection of sar ##s .  
abstract va ##cci ##nation against the sar ##s - co ##v infection is an attractive means to control the spread of viruses in public . in this study , we employed a dna vaccine technology with the lev ##ami ##sol ##e , our newly discovered chemical ad ##ju ##vant , to generate th ##1 type of response . to avoid the enhancement antibody issue , genes encoding the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , membrane , and envelope protein of sar ##s - co ##v were clone ##d and their expressions in mammalian cells were determined . after the intra ##mus ##cular introduction into animals , we observed that the construct ##s of the e , m , and n genes could induce high levels of specific antibodies , t cell proliferation ##s , if ##n - γ , dt ##h responses , and in vivo cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t cells activities specifically against sar ##s - co ##v antigen ##s . the highest immune responses were generated by the construct encoding the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . the results suggest that the n , m , and e genes could be used as the targets to prevent sar ##s - co ##v infection in the dna vaccine development .  
summary background scientific evidence suggests that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the inter ##media ##ry host for the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . however , the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camel ##s is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact . we aimed to do a nationwide ser ##os ##ur ##vey in saudi arabia to establish the prevalence of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies , both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camel ##s . methods in the cross - sectional ser ##os ##ur ##vey , we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health - care centres or participated in a national burden - of - disease study in all 13 provinces of saudi arabia . additionally , we tested serum samples from shepherd ##s and aba ##tto ##ir workers with occupational exposure to camel ##s . samples were screened by rec ##om ##bina ##nt elisa and mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity was confirmed by rec ##om ##bina ##nt im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence and plaque reduction neutral ##isation tests . we used two - tailed mann whitney u exact tests , χ ##2 , and fisher ' s exact tests to anal ##yse the data . findings between dec 1 , 2012 , and dec 1 , 2013 , we obtained individual serum samples from 10 00 ##9 individuals . anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibodies were confirmed in 15 ( 0 · 15 % ; 95 % ci 0 · 09 – 0 · 24 ) of 10 00 ##9 people in six of the 13 provinces . the mean age of ser ##op ##osi ##tive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported , laboratory - confirmed , primary middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( 43 · 5 years [ sd 17 · 3 ] vs 53 · 8 years [ 17 · 5 ] ; p = 0 · 00 ##8 ) . men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women ( 11 [ 0 · 25 % ] of 43 ##41 vs two [ 0 · 05 % ] of 43 ##7 ##8 ; p = 0 · 02 ##8 ) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces ( 14 [ 0 · 26 % ] of 54 ##7 ##9 vs one [ 0 · 02 % ] of 45 ##29 ; p = 0 · 00 ##3 ) . compared with the general population , ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherd ##s ( two [ 2 · 3 % ] of 87 , p = 0 · 000 ##4 ) and by 23 times in slaughter ##house workers ( five [ 3 · 6 % ] of 140 ;
since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in wu ##han , china , the number of globally confirmed cases according to world health organization statistics reached 292 124 in 189 countries by 22 march 2020 . the number of deaths reached 12 78 ##4 , with estimated case - fatal ##ity rates ranging from 0 . 5 % to 5 . 7 % . children population seems to be the least affected by the disease , while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with como ##rb ##idi ##ties . most infected individuals are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or only exhibit mild symptoms . after the inc ##uba ##tion period , the most common symptoms are fever , cough and fatigue . as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers ' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings . although much is still unknown about sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature , effective control , prevention and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus , which may explain the rapid spread and changing ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , but further evidence is needed . unfortunately , no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease ; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 pan ##de ##mic .  
une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d pneumonia ( up ) caused by a novel corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ) emerged in china in late december 2019 and has infected more than 900 ##0 cases by 31 january 2020 . shanghai reported the first imported case of co ##vid - 19 ( corona ##virus disease 2019 ) in 20 january 2020 . a comb ##ina ##tive approach of real - time rt – pc ##r , crisp ##r - based ass ##ay and meta ##gen ##omic next - generation sequencing ( mn ##gs ) were used to dia ##gno ##se this une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d pneumonia patient . real - time rt – pc ##r and crisp ##r - based ass ##ay both reported positive . this sample belonged to beta ##cor ##ona ##virus and shared a more than 99 % nu ##cle ##otide ( nt ) identity with the wu ##han sar ##s - co ##v - 2 isolate ##s . we further compared pro ##s and con ##s of common molecular diagnostic ##s in up . in this study , we illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostic ##s to rule out common pathogen ##s and performed mn ##gs to obtain un ##bia ##sed potential pathogen result for the diagnosis of up .  
abstract phase i human clinical studies involving therapeutic ##s for emerging and bio ##de ##fen ##se pathogen ##s with low incidence , such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , requires at a minimum pre ##cl ##ini ##cal evaluation of efficacy in two well - characterized and robust animal models . thus , a fe ##rret sar ##s - co ##v model was evaluated over a period of 58 days following extensive optimization and characterization of the model in order to valid ##ate clinical , his ##top ##ath ##ological , vi ##rol ##ogical and im ##mun ##ological end ##points . fe ##rret ##s that were infected intra ##nas ##ally with 103 tc ##id ##50 sar ##s - co ##v showed higher body temperature ( 2 – 6 d . p . i . ) , s ##nee ##zing ( 5 – 10 d . p . i . ) , lesions ( 5 – 7 d . p . i . ) and decreased wb ##c / l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes ( 2 – 5 d . p . i . ) . sar ##s - co ##v was detected up to 7 d . p . i . in various tissues and ex ##cre ##ta , while neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters rose at 7 d . p . i . and peaked at 14 d . p . i . at 29 d . p . i . , one group was challenged with 103 tc ##id ##50 sar ##s - co ##v , and an ana ##m ##nes ##tic response in neutral ##izing antibodies was evident with no detect ##able virus . this study supports the validity of the fe ##rret model for use in evaluating efficacy of potential therapeutic ##s to treat sar ##s .  
viruses have evolved a myriad of strategies for promoting viral replication , survival and spread . sequence analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome predict ##s several proteins that are unique to sar ##s - co ##v . the search to understand the high vi ##ru ##lence of sar ##s - co ##v compared with related corona ##virus ##es , which cause lesser respiratory illnesses , has recently focused on the unique ns ##p ##1 protein of sar ##s - co ##v and suggests evolution of a possible new vi ##ru ##lence mechanism in corona ##virus ##es . the sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 protein increases cellular rna degradation and thus might facilitate sar ##s - co ##v replication or block immune responses .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is characterized by rapidly progressing respiratory failure resembling acute / adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) associated with un ##con ##tro ##lled inflammatory responses . here , we demonstrated that , among five accessory proteins of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) tested , 3a / x ##1 and 7 ##a / x ##4 were capable of act ##ivating nuclear factor kappa b ( n ##f - κ ##b ) and c - jun n - terminal kinase ( j ##nk ) , and significantly enhanced inter ##le ##uki ##n 8 ( il - 8 ) promoter activity . furthermore , 3a / x ##1 and 7 ##a / x ##4 expression in a ##54 ##9 cells enhanced production of inflammatory che ##mo ##kin ##es that were known to be up - regulated in sar ##s - co ##v infection . our results suggest potential involvement of 3a / x ##1 and 7 ##a / x ##4 proteins in the path ##ological inflammatory responses in sar ##s .  
abstract in 2002 / 2003 , a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) caused a pan ##de ##mic , in ##fect ##ing more than 800 ##0 people , of whom nearly 10 % died . this virus , termed severe acute respiratory syndrome - co ##v was linked to a zoo ##not ##ic origin from rhino ##lo ##phi ##d bats in 2005 . since then , numerous studies have described novel bat co ##vs , including close relatives of the newly emerging middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v . in this paper we discuss co ##v gen ##omic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full gen ##omic sequences directly from bat specimens . we first present an overview of the available studies on bat co ##vs , with details on their chi ##rop ##tera ##n hosts , then comparatively analyze the increase in bat co ##v studies and novel gen ##omic sequences obtained since the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic . we then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera alpha - and beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , to show that bats harbour more co ##v diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most , but not all parts of the tree of mammalian co ##vs . we next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co - segregation of co ##vs and bat hosts encompassing the beta ##cor ##ona ##virus clade ##s b and d , with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals , then present examples of co ##vs in ##fect ##ing different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other . we also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat co ##vs , and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hot ##sp ##ots in africa , asia and latin america . we then present evidence for a zoo ##not ##ic origin of four of the six known human co ##vs ( hc ##ov ) , three of which likely involved bats , namely sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - 229 ##e ; compare the available data on co ##v pathogen ##esis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts ; and discuss h ##yp ##oth ##eses on the put ##ative insect origins of co ##v ancestors . finally , we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoo ##not ##ic potential of bat viruses , based only on gen ##omic sequence data , and emphasize the need to preserve these ecological ##ly highly relevant animals . this paper forms part of a symposium in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ” .  
abstract shortly after its emergence in southern china in 2002 / 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was confirmed to be the cause of sar ##s . subsequently , sar ##s - related co ##vs ( sar ##sr - co ##vs ) were found in palm ci ##vet ##s from live animal markets in guangdong and in various horseshoe bat species , which were believed to be the ultimate reservoir of sar ##sr - co ##v . till november 2018 , 339 sar ##sr - co ##v genome ##s have been sequence ##d , including 274 from human , 18 from ci ##vet ##s and 47 from bats [ mostly from chinese horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus ) , n = 30 ; and greater horseshoe bats ( rhino ##lo ##phus fe ##rr ##ume ##quin ##um ) , n = 9 ] . the human sar ##s - co ##vs and ci ##vet sar ##sr - co ##vs were collected in 2003 / 2004 , while bat sar ##sr - co ##vs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the ce ##ssa ##tion of the sar ##s epidemic . sar ##sr - co ##vs belong to the subgenus sar ##be ##co ##virus ( previously lineage b ) of genus beta ##cor ##ona ##virus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position . overall , it is observed that the sar ##sr - co ##v genome ##s from bats in yunnan province of china possess the highest nu ##cle ##otide identity to those from ci ##vet ##s . it is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular sar ##sr - co ##v from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nu ##cle ##otide identity to the corresponding genes of sar ##sr - co ##v from human / ci ##vet ##s , resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees . our current model on the origin of sar ##s is that the human sar ##s - co ##v that caused the epidemic in 2002 / 2003 was probably a result of multiple rec ##om ##bina ##tion events from a number of sar ##sr - co ##v ancestors in different horseshoe bat species .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se is essential for viral protein processing and is regarded as a good drug target to prevent sar ##s - co ##v replication . in the present study , we established a high - through ##put fr ##et technique for screening for anti - sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se drugs . of a thousand existing drugs examined , he ##xa ##ch ##lor ##op ##hen ##e was identified as the most potent in inhibit ##ing sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se . further characterization showed that it was effective at micro ##mo ##lar concentrations ( k i = 4 ##μ ##m ) . the binding mode was competitive , and the inhibitor ##y effect was dependent on pre ##in ##cu ##bation time . two other drugs , tri ##cl ##osa ##n and ne ##lf ##ina ##vir , were about 10 times less potent . the structure - based search and biological evaluation of various he ##xa ##ch ##lor ##op ##hen ##e analogue ##s were described . these analogue ##s gave optimal inhibitor ##y activity against sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se with ic ##50 values ranging from 7 . 6 to 84 . 5 ##μ ##m . optimization of he ##xa ##ch ##lor ##op ##hen ##e analogue ##s was shown to provide several active 3 ##cl pro ##tea ##se inhibitors that function as potential anti - sar ##s agents .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a novel corona ##virus and causing worldwide outbreak ##s . sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an enveloped rna virus , which contains several structural proteins . among these proteins , spike ( s ) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt , which induce ##s neutral ##izing antibody . in order to analyze the antigen ##ici ##ty and receptor - binding ability of sar ##s - co ##v s protein , we expressed the s protein in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli using a pet expression vector . after the iso ##pro ##py ##l - β - d - th ##io ##gal ##act ##osi ##de induction , s protein was expressed in the soluble form and pu ##rified by nickel - affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy to homo ##gen ##eit ##y . the amount of s protein recovered was 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 ##mg / 100 ##ml bacterial culture . the s protein was recognized by sera from sar ##s patients by elisa and western b ##lot , which indicated that rec ##om ##bina ##nt s protein retained its antigen ##ici ##ty . by bio ##tin ##yla ##ted elisa and western b ##lot using bio ##tin - labeled s protein as the probe , we identified 130 - k ##da and 140 - k ##da proteins in ve ##ro cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for sar ##s - co ##v infection . taken together , these results suggested that rec ##om ##bina ##nt s protein exhibited the antigen ##ici ##ty and receptor - binding ability , and it could be a good candidate for further developing sar ##s vaccine and anti - sar ##s therapy .  
summary background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe lower respiratory tract infection in people . previous studies suggested dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s were a reservoir for this virus . we tested for the presence of mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from a farm in qatar linked to two human cases of the infection in october , 2013 . methods we took nose sw ##ab ##s , rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s , and blood samples from all camel ##s on the qatar ##i farm . we tested sw ##ab ##s with rt - pc ##r , with amp ##li ##fication targeting the e gene ( up ##e ) , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) gene , and open reading frame ( or ##f ) 1a . pc ##r positive samples were tested by different mer ##s - co ##v specific pc ##rs and obtained sequences were used for ph ##yl ##ogen ##tic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases . we tested serum samples from the camel ##s for i ##gg im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay , protein micro ##ar ##ray , and virus neutral ##isation ass ##ay . findings we obtained samples from 14 camel ##s on oct 17 , 2013 . we detected mer ##s - co ##v in nose sw ##ab ##s from three camel ##s by three independent rt - pc ##rs and sequencing . the nu ##cle ##otide sequence of an or ##f ##1 ##a fragment ( 94 ##0 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) and a 4 · 2 kb con ##cate ##nated fragment were very similar to the mer ##s - co ##v from two human cases on the same farm and a mer ##s - co ##v isolate from ha ##fr - al - bat ##in . eight additional camel nose sw ##ab ##s were positive on one or more rt - pc ##rs , but could not be confirmed by sequencing . all camel ##s had mer ##s - co ##v spike - binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutral ##ising antibodies to mer ##s - co ##v . interpretation our study provides vi ##rol ##ogical confirmation of mer ##s - co ##v in camel ##s and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camel ##s . we cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camel ##s or vice versa , or if a third source was responsible . funding european union projects em ##per ##ie ( contract number 223 ##49 ##8 ) , anti ##gon ##e ( contract number 278 ##9 ##7 ##6 ) , and the vi ##rgo consortium .

summary background an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been associated with an outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia originating in guangdong province , people ' s republic of china . we aimed to identify the ca ##usa ##tive agent in the guangdong outbreak and describe the emergence and spread of the disease within the province . methods we anal ##yse ##d ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information and collected serum and nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates from patients with sar ##s in guangdong in mid - february , 2003 . we did virus isolation , ser ##ological tests , and molecular ass ##ays to identify the ca ##usa ##tive agent . findings sar ##s had been circulating in other cities of guangdong province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in guangzhou , the province ' s capital . a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , was isolated from specimens from three patients with sar ##s . viral antigen ##s were also directly detected in nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al as ##pi ##rates from these patients . 48 of 55 ( 87 % ) patients had antibodies to sar ##s co ##v in their con ##vale ##scent sera . genetic analysis showed that the sar ##s co ##v isolate ##s from guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries , and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of sar ##s to the other parts of the world . interpretation sar ##s co ##v is the infectious agent responsible for the epidemic outbreak of sar ##s in guangdong . the virus isolated from patients in guangdong is the prototype of the sar ##s co ##v in other regions and countries .  
beijing has been one of the epic ##enter ##s attacked most severely by the sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ) since the first patient was diagnosed in one of the city ’ s hospitals . we now report complete genome sequences of the b ##j group , including four isolate ##s ( isolate ##s b ##j ##01 , b ##j ##0 ##2 , b ##j ##0 ##3 , and b ##j ##0 ##4 ) of the sar ##s - co ##v . it is remarkable that all members of the b ##j group share a common ha ##pl ##otype , consisting of seven lo ##ci that differentiate the group from other isolate ##s published to date . among 42 substitution ##s uniquely identified from the b ##j group , 32 are non - synonymous changes at the amino acid level . rooted phylogenetic trees , proposed on the basis of ha ##pl ##otype ##s and other sequence variations of sar ##s - co ##v isolate ##s from canada , usa , singapore , and china , gave rise to different paradigm ##s but positioned the b ##j group , together with the newly discovered g ##d ##01 ( g ##d - ins ##29 ) in the same clade , followed by the h - u group ( from hong kong to usa ) and the h - t group ( from hong kong to toronto ) , leaving the sp group ( singapore ) more distant . this result appears to suggest a possible transmission path from guangdong to beijing / hong kong , then to other countries and regions .  
abstract south - east asia is a hot spot for emerging zoo ##not ##ic diseases , and bats have been recognized as hosts for a large number of zoo ##not ##ic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , responsible for acute respiratory syndrome outbreak ##s . thus , it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans . corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have been reported in bat species from thailand , china , indonesia , taiwan and the philippines . however no such work was conducted in cambodia or lao pd ##r . between 2010 and 2013 , 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries . they were tested for the presence of corona ##virus by consensus reverse transcription - pc ##r ass ##ay . a total of 93 samples ( 4 . 7 % ) from 17 genera of bats tested positive . sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 corona ##virus belonging to alpha - corona ##virus ( α ##co ##v ) and beta - co ##v ( β ##co ##v ) , respectively . the β ##co ##vs group is known to include some corona ##virus ##es highly pathogen ##ic to human , such as sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . all corona ##virus sequences generated from fr ##ug ##ivo ##rous bats ( family pt ##ero ##pod ##idae ) ( n = 55 ) clustered with other bat β ##co ##vs of lineage d , whereas one corona ##virus from pip ##ist ##rell ##us co ##rom ##andra fell in the lineage c of β ##co ##vs which also includes the mer ##s - co ##v . α ##co ##vs were all detected in various genera of insect ##ivo ##rous bats and clustered with diverse bat α ##co ##v sequences previously published . a closely related strain of pe ##d ##v , responsible for severe dia ##rr ##hea in pigs ( pe ##d ##v - co ##v ) , was detected in 2 my ##ot ##is bats . we highlighted the presence and the high diversity of corona ##virus ##es circulating in bats from cambodia and lao pd ##r . three new bat genera and species were newly identified as host of corona ##virus ##es , namely macro ##gl ##oss ##us sp . , mega ##ero ##ps ni ##pha ##nae and my ##ot ##is ho ##rs ##field ##ii 
the emergence of a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has awakened the echoes of sar ##s - co ##v from nearly two decades ago . yet , with technological advances and important lessons gained from previous outbreak ##s , perhaps the world is better equipped to deal with the most recent emerge ##nt group 2 ##b corona ##virus .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance , has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1600 people , resulting in more than 600 deaths . the high case fatal ##ity rate , growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v have created an urgent need for effective public health counter ##me ##as ##ures , paramount of which is an effective means of prevention through a vaccine or antibody prop ##hyl ##ax ##is . despite the relatively few number of cases to - date , research and development of mer ##s - co ##v vaccine candidates is advancing quickly . this review surveys the landscape of these efforts across multiple groups in academia , government and industry .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es are enveloped rna viruses that generally cause mild disease in humans . however , the recently emerged corona ##virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the most pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus discovered to date . the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein media ##tes virus entry by binding cellular receptors and inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane . corona ##virus s proteins are palm ##ito ##yla ##ted , which may affect function . here , we created a non - palm ##ito ##yla ##ted sar ##s - co ##v s protein by mu ##tat ##ing all nine cy ##top ##las ##mic cy ##stein ##e residues . palm ##ito ##yla ##tion of sar ##s - co ##v s was required for partition ##ing into deter ##gent - resistant membranes and for cell – cell fusion . surprisingly , however , palm ##ito ##yla ##tion of s was not required for interaction with sar ##s - co ##v m protein . this contrasts with the requirement for palm ##ito ##yla ##tion of mouse hepatitis virus s protein for interaction with m protein and may point to important differences in assembly and in ##fect ##ivity of these two corona ##virus ##es .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is a dreadful infection worldwide having economic and medical importance and a global threat for health . it was turned into an epidemic in south china followed by a chain of infections across three generations . a number of pathogen ##eses in human may occur due to the virus . this infection has not been taken into account before the sar ##s outbreak , and still it is a neglected one . therefore , there is an urgent need to develop small molecule anti ##vira ##ls to combat the sar ##s - co ##v . no vaccines are available till date though a number of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##c - like and 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se inhibitors were reported . in this chapter , quantitative structure – activity relationship technique is used for development of anti - sar ##s and anti - hr ##v drugs and outcome discussed in details . this approach may be a useful strategy to design novel and potential anti - sar ##s drugs to combat these dreadful viral diseases .  
abstract the sar ##s - associated human corona ##virus ( sar ##s - hc ##ov ) is a newly described , emerging virus con ##clusive ##ly established as the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . this study presents a single - tube rt - pc ##r ass ##ay that can detect with high analytical sensitivity the sar ##s - hc ##ov , as well as several other corona ##virus ##es including other known human respiratory corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 and hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) . species identification is provided by sequencing the amp ##lic ##on , although a rapid screening test by restriction enzyme analysis has proved to be very useful for the analysis of samples obtained during the sar ##s outbreak in toronto , canada .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a highly pathogen ##ic respiratory virus with mechanisms that may be driven by innate immune responses . despite the effort of scientific studies related to this virus , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is still a public health concern . mer ##s - co ##v infection has a high mortality rate , and to date , no therapeutic or vaccine has been discovered , that is effective in treating or preventing the disease . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize our understanding of the molecular and biological events of compounds acting as mer ##s - co ##v inhibitors , the outcomes of existing therapeutic options and the various drugs undergoing clinical trials . currently , several therapeutic options have been employed , such as con ##vale ##scent plasma ( cp ) , intra ##ven ##ous im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin ( iv ##ig ) , mono ##cl ##onal antibodies and rep ##ur ##po ##sing of existing clinical ##ly approved drugs . however , these therapeutic options have draw ##backs , thus the need for an alternative approach . the requirement for effective therapeutic treatment has brought the necessity for additional mer ##s treatments . we suggest that anti ##mic ##ro ##bial peptide ##s ( amp ##s ) may be used as alternative therapeutic agents against mer ##s - co ##v infection . in addition , we propose the feasibility of developing effective agents by rep ##ur ##po ##sing the existing and clinical ##ly approved anti - corona ##virus and anti - viral peptide drugs .  
abstract acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) is a severe form of acute lung injury . it is a response to various diseases of variable et ##iology , including sar ##s - co ##v infection . to date , a comprehensive study of the gen ##omic ph ##ys ##io ##path ##ology of ar ##ds ( and sar ##s ) is lacking , primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level ( instead of blood , sp ##uta or swap ##s ) . here ##by we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of sar ##s and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement . we performed real - time quantitative pc ##r analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation , coa ##gul ##ation , fi ##bro ##sis and ap ##op ##tosis ; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed . significant expression levels were identified for an ##pe ##p ( a receptor for co ##v ) , as well as inhibition of the stat ##1 pathway , if ##ns production and c ##x ##cl ##10 ( a t - cell recruit ##er ) . other genes una ##sso ##cia ##ted to date with ar ##ds / sar ##s include c1 ##q ##b , c ##5 ##r ##1 , cas ##p ##3 , cas ##p ##9 , cd ##14 , cd ##6 ##8 , f ##gf ##7 , h ##la - dr ##a , i ##gf ##1 , ir ##f ##3 , mala ##t - 1 , ms ##r ##1 , n ##fi ##l ##3 , sl ##pi , us ##p ##33 , cl ##c , gb ##p ##1 and ta ##c ##1 . as a result , we proposed to therapeutic ##ally target some of these genes with compounds such as an ##pe ##p inhibitors , sl ##pi and dex ##ame ##tha ##son ##e . ultimately , this study may serve as a model for future , tissue - based analyses of fi ##bro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory conditions affecting the lung .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a respiratory disease caused by a zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ( co ##v ) named sar ##s - co ##v ( sc ##ov ) , which rapidly swept the globe after its emergence in rural china during late 2002 . the origins of sc ##ov have been mysterious and controversial , until the recent discovery of sar ##s - like co ##v ( sl ##co ##v ) in bats and the proposal of bats as the natural res ##er ##vio ##r of the corona ##vir ##idae family . in this article , we focused on discussing how phylogenetic ##s contributed to our understanding towards the emergence and transmission of sc ##ov . we first reviewed the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of sc ##ov from a phylogenetic perspective and discussed the controversies over its phylogenetic origins . then , we summarized the phylogenetic findings in relation to its zoo ##not ##ic origins and the proposed inter - species viral transmission events . finally , we also discussed how the discoveries of sc ##ov and sl ##co ##v expanded our knowledge on the evolution of the corona ##vir ##idae family as well as its implications on the possible future re - emergence of sc ##ov .  
abstract two highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es associated with severe respiratory syndrome ##s emerged since the beginning of the century . the severe acute respiratory syndrome sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spread first in southern china in 2003 with about 800 ##0 infected cases in few months . then in 2012 , the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged from the arabian peninsula giving a still on - going epidemic associated to a high fatal ##ity rate . co ##vs are thus considered a major health threat . this is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either sar ##s - or mer ##s - co ##v . therefore , new drugs need to be identified in order to develop anti ##vira ##l treatments limiting co ##v replication . in this study , we focus on the ns ##p ##14 protein , which plays a key role in virus replication as it methyl ##ates the rna cap structure at the n ##7 position of the gu ##ani ##ne . we developed a high - through ##put n ##7 - mt ##ase ass ##ay based on homo ##gen ##ous time resolved flu ##orescence ( h ##tr ##f ##® ) and screened chemical libraries ( 2000 compounds ) on the sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##14 . 20 compounds inhibit ##ing the sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##14 were further evaluated by ic ##50 determination and their specific ##ity was assessed toward fl ##avi ##virus - and human cap n ##7 - mt ##ase ##s . our results reveal three classes of compounds : 1 ) molecules inhibit ##ing several mt ##ase ##s as well as the deng ##ue virus polymer ##ase activity un ##sp ##ec ##ific ##ally , 2 ) pan mt ##ase ##s inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular mt ##ase ##s , and 3 ) inhibitors targeting one viral mt ##ase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap n ##7 - mt ##ase . these compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##ses .  
abstract sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) , a newly emerging enter ##ic corona ##virus , is considered to be associated with sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome ( sad ##s ) which has caused significantly economic losses to the por ##cine industry . interactions between sad ##s - co ##v and the host innate immune response is unclear yet . in this study , we used ip ##ec - j ##2 cells as a model to explore potential eva ##sion strategies employed by sad ##s - co ##v . our results showed that sad ##s - co ##v infection failed to induce if ##n - β production , and inhibit ##ed poly ( i : c ) and send ##ai virus ( se ##v ) - triggered if ##n - β expression . sad ##s - co ##v also blocked poly ( i : c ) - induced ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and nuclear trans ##lo ##cation of ir ##f - 3 and n ##f - κ ##b . furthermore , sad ##s - co ##v did not interfere with the activity of if ##n - β promoter stimulated by ir ##f ##3 , tb ##k ##1 and ik ##k ##ε , but counter ##act ##ed its activation induced by ip ##s - 1 and rig - i . collectively , this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between sad ##s - co ##v and the host innate immunity , which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying sas ##d - co ##v infection .  
abstract the envelope spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) media ##tes the entry of the virus into target cells . recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses , such as hiv - 1 . as it happens with other viruses pep ##ti ##dic fusion inhibitors , sar ##s - co ##v s protein hr ##2 - derived peptide ##s are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus . it is believed that hr ##2 peptide ##s block the six - helix bundle formation , a key structure in the viral fusion , by interacting with the hr ##1 region . it is a matter of discussion if the hiv - 1 gp ##41 hr ##2 - derived peptide t ##20 ( en ##fu ##vir ##ti ##de ) could be a possible sar ##s - co ##v inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses . we tested the possibility of interaction between both t ##20 ( hiv - 1 gp ##41 hr ##2 - derived peptide ) and t - 124 ##9 with s protein hr ##1 - and hr ##2 - derived peptide ##s . our bio ##physical data show a significant interaction between a sar ##s - co ##v hr ##1 - derived peptide and t ##20 . however , the interaction is only moderate ( k b = ( 1 . 1 ##± ##0 . 3 ) × ##10 ##5 m ##−1 ) . this finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that t ##20 , already approved for clinical application in aids treatment , could inhibit the fusion of sar ##s - co ##v with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application .  
summary middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a novel corona ##virus that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans , emerged in the middle east in 2012 . since then , mer ##s - co ##v has caused an ongoing epidemic in the arabian peninsula with sporadic cases imported in europe , north africa , southeast asia , and the united states of america . as of 28th may 2014 , 63 ##6 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with mer ##s - co ##v have been reported to world health organization including 14 cases imported by travelers . the epic ##enter of the current mer ##s - co ##v epidemic is located in saudi arabia , where millions of pilgrims travel for two mass gatherings annually . in this review we sum ##mar ##ize mer ##s - co ##v cases in relation to travel with focus on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and prevention in travelers . it is important to increase awareness of travelers about the risks and appropriate prevent ##ive measures and for health professionals to be on alert if a patient with severe respiratory symptoms reports a recent history of travel to the region affected with mer ##s - co ##v . measures should be taken by local health authorities of the affected countries in order to improve hospital hygiene . finally , it is crucial to investigate the reasons for travelers ' poor compliance with rules and recommendations issued by saudi officials and to take appropriate measures in order to improve them .  
abstract to differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) from non - sar ##s illness , we retrospective ##ly compared 53 patients with probable sar ##s and 31 patients with non - sar ##s who were admitted to mackay memorial hospital from april 27 to june 16 , 2003 . fever ( > 38 ##° ##c ) was the earliest sy ##mpt ##om ( 50 / 53 sar ##s vs . 5 / 31 non - sar ##s , p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) , preceding cough by a mean of 4 . 5 days . the initial chest x - ray study was normal in 22 / 53 sar ##s cases versus 5 / 31 non - sar ##s cases . sar ##s patients with an initially normal chest x - ray study developed infiltrate ##s at a mean of 5 ± 3 . 44 days after onset of fever ( 21 / 22 sar ##s vs . 0 / 5 non - sar ##s ) . rapid radio ##graphic progression of un ##if ##oca ##l involvement to multi ##fo ##cal infiltrate ##s was seen in 22 of 24 sar ##s vs . 0 of 26 non - sar ##s patients ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) . pl ##eur ##al e ##ff ##usion was not present in any sar ##s patients but was seen in 6 of 26 non - sar ##s cases ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) . initial l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia , th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia , and elevated lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase were all more common in sar ##s than non - sar ##s ( p < 0 . 000 ##1 ) . they may help differentiate sar ##s from non - sar ##s if a reliable and rapid diagnostic test is not available .  
abstract sar ##s corona ##virus main pro ##tea ##se ( sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro ) is essential for the replication of the virus and regarded as a major anti ##vira ##l drug target . the enzyme is a cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se , with a catalytic d ##yad ( cy ##s - 145 / his - 41 ) in the active site . al ##deh ##yde inhibitors can bind rev ##ers ##ibly to the active - site sul ##f ##hy ##dry ##l of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro . previous studies using pep ##ti ##dic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specific ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro requires g ##lu ##tam ##ine in the p ##1 position and a large hydro ##phobic residue in the p ##2 position . we determined four crystal structures of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro in complex with pen ##ta ##pe ##pt ##ide al ##deh ##yde ##s ( ac - est ##l ##q - h , ac - ns ##fs ##q - h , ac - ds ##f ##d ##q - h , and ac - ns ##ts ##q - h ) . kinetic data showed that all of these al ##deh ##yde ##s exhibit inhibitor ##y activity towards sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro , with ki values in the μ ##m range . surprisingly , the x - ray structures revealed that the hydro ##phobic s ##2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate ser ##ine and even as ##par ##tic - acid side - chains in the p ##2 positions of the inhibitors . consequently , we re ##asse ##ssed the substrate specific ##ity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different te ##tra ##de ##cape ##pt ##ide substrates with varying amino - acid residues in the p ##2 position . the cleavage efficiency for the substrate with ser ##ine in the p ##2 position was 160 - times lower than that for the original substrate ( p ##2 = le ##u ) ; furthermore , the substrate with as ##par ##tic acid in the p ##2 position was not cl ##ea ##ved at all . we also determined a crystal structure of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro in complex with al ##deh ##yde cm - ff - h , which has its p ##1 - ph ##en ##yla ##lani ##ne residue bound to the relatively hydro ##phi ##lic s ##1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitor ##y activity against sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro , with ki = 2 . 24 ##± ##0 . 58 ##μ ##m . these results show that the string ##ent substrate specific ##ity of the sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro with respect to the p ##1 and p ##2 positions can be over ##ru ##led by the highly electro ##phi ##lic character of the al ##deh ##yde war ##head , thereby con ##stituting a deviation from the dog ##ma that pep
abstract the complete genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and many of its variants has been determined by several laboratories . the genome contains fourteen predicted open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . however , a function had been clearly assigned for only six of these or ##fs , in the viral replication , transcription and structural constituents . the others are here ##in referred to as un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized or ##fs ( uc - or ##fs ) . here , we try to provide a relational insight on those uc - or ##fs , suggesting that a number of them are remotely related to structural proteins of corona ##virus ##es and other viruses in ##fect ##ing mammalian hosts . surprisingly , several of the uc - or ##fs exhibit considerable similarity with other sar ##s - co ##v or ##fs . these observations may provide clues on the evolution and genome dynamics of the sar ##s - co ##v .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a novel infectious disease with disastrous clinical consequences , in which the lungs are the major target organs . previous studies have described the general pathology in the lungs of sar ##s patients and have identified some of the cell types infected by sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . however , at the time of this writing , there were no comprehensive reports of the cellular distribution of the virus in lung tissue . in this study , we have performed double labeling combining in situ hybrid ##ization with im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry and alternating each of these techniques separately in consecutive sections to evaluate the viral distribution on various cell types in the lungs of seven patients affected with sar ##s . we found that sar ##s - co ##v was present in bro ##nch ##ial ep ##ith ##eli ##um , type i and ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , and macro ##pha ##ges / mono ##cytes . for p ##ne ##um ##ocytes , t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes , and macro ##pha ##ges , the infection rates were calculated . in addition , our present study is the first to demonstrate infection of end ##oth ##elial cells and fi ##bro ##bla ##sts in sar ##s .  
abstract the corona ##virus membrane protein ( m ) is the key player in the assembly of vi ##rion ##s at intra ##cellular membranes between end ##op ##las ##mic - re ##tic ##ulum and go ##l ##gi - complex . using a newly established human mono ##cl ##onal anti - m antibody we detected g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted and non ##gly ##cos ##yla ##ted membrane - associated m in severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infected cells and in pu ##rified vi ##rion ##s . further analyses revealed that m contained a single n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site at as ##para ##gin ##e 4 . rec ##om ##bina ##nt m was transported to the plasma membrane and gained complex - type n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion . in sar ##s - co ##v infected cells and in pu ##rified vi ##rion ##s , however , n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion of m remained end ##og ##ly ##cos ##ida ##se h - sensitive suggesting that trim ##ming of the n - linked sugar side chain is inhibit ##ed .  
knowledge of the evolution of pathogen ##s is of great medical and biological significance to the prevention , diagnosis , and therapy of infectious diseases . in order to understand the origin and evolution of the sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ) , we collected complete genome sequences of all viruses available in gen ##bank , and made comparative analyses with the sar ##s - co ##v . gen ##omic signature analysis demonstrates that the corona ##virus ##es all take the t ##gt ##t as their richest te ##tra ##nu ##cle ##otide except the sar ##s - co ##v . a detailed analysis of the forty - two complete sar ##s - co ##v genome sequences revealed the existence of two distinct gen ##otype ##s , and showed that these isolate ##s could be classified into four groups . our manual analysis of the blast ##n results demonstrates that the he ( hem ##ag ##gl ##uti ##nin - este ##rase ) gene exists in the sar ##s - co ##v , and many mutations made it unfamiliar to us .  
abstract it has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 3a and 7 ##a proteins , but not membrane ( m ) protein , induce ap ##op ##tosis in mammalian cells . upon expression of sar ##s - co ##v m protein using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus / insect cell expression system , however , we found that the expressed m protein triggered accelerated ap ##op ##tosis in insect cells , as characterized by rapid cell death , elevated cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city , cell shrink ##age , nuclear conde ##ns ##ation and dna fragmentation . conversely , the m protein expressed in mammalian cells did not induce ap ##op ##tosis . this is the first report describing the induction of ap ##op ##tosis by sar ##s - co ##v m protein in animal cells and possible implications are discussed .  
a middle east respiratory corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak occurred in korea between june 20 and july 28 , 2015 . a total of 186 patients were confirmed as being infected with mer ##s - co ##v , 36 of whom died . infection control nurses referred to hospital guidelines to address the screening and isolation needs of patients and ins ##ti ##gated a variety of infection control activities to prevent mer ##s - co ##v transmission at the front ##lines of patient care . their concert ##ed effort is believed to have been instrumental in ending the outbreak .  
abstract the high su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of elderly to severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) indicates how crucial it is to protect the elderly by various strategies . aged bal ##b / c mice displayed a high su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to sar ##s - co ##v and have been a valuable platform for evaluation of strategies against sar ##s - co ##v infection . in this study , we confirmed the validity of this model using various methods , and verified that e ##quin ##e anti - sar ##s - co ##v f ( ab ' ) 2 can prevent aged animals from sar ##s - co ##v infection . in a therapeutic setting , treatment with anti - sar ##s - co ##v f ( ab ' ) 2 decreased viral load more than several thousand folds in the lungs . thus , this antibody should be a potential candidate for treatment of elderly patients suffering from sar ##s .  
abstract five years after the first severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak , several candidate sar ##s - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) vaccines are at various stages of pre ##cl ##ini ##cal and clinical development . based on the observation that sar ##sco ##v infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the spike ( s ) protein of sar ##s - co ##v , vaccines containing the s protein have been formulated . animals im ##mun ##ized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live - rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccines expressing the sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( e . g . , using ra ##bies virus , ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus , bo ##vine para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus type 3 , aden ##ov ##irus , or at ##ten ##uated va ##cci ##nia virus mv ##a as a vector ) , as well as mice im ##mun ##ized with dna vaccines expressing the s protein gene all developed neutral ##izing antibodies to sar ##s - co ##v and were protected against sar ##s - co ##v challenge . although much effort has been focused on developing a sar ##s vaccine , the commercial via ##bility of such a vaccine for sar ##s - co ##v will ultimately depend on whether the virus re - emerges in the near future . this vaccine should induce highly cross - reactive neutral ##izing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to sar ##s - co ##v and protect both the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects . given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection , special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a rapidly spreading infectious disease which was transmitted in late 2002 and early 2003 to more than 28 countries through the medium of international travel . the evolution and spread of sar ##s has resulted in an international effort coordinated by the world health organization ( who ) . we have formulated a discrete mathematical model to investigate the transmission of sar ##s and determined the basic reproductive number for this model to use as a threshold to determine the as ##ym ##pt ##otic behavior of the model . the dependence of the basic reproductive number on epidemic parameters has been studied . the parameters of the model have been estimated on the basis of statistical data and numerical simulations have been carried out to describe the transmission process for sar ##s in china . the simulation results matches the statistical data well and indicate that early qu ##aran ##tine and a high qu ##aran ##tine rate are crucial to the control of sar ##s .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the sar ##s outbreak ##s in 2002 – 2003 . a safer in vitro system is desirable for conducting research on sar ##s - co ##v and to screen for anti ##vira ##l drugs against the virus . based on the infectious cd ##na clone of rs ##ars - co ##v - δ ##e , in which the e gene has been deleted , a safe non - infectious rep ##lic ##on was constructed by replacing the s gene with the enhanced green fluorescent protein ( e ##gf ##p ) gene . successful replication was achieved as evident from continuous expression of e ##gf ##p detected by both flu ##orescence and western b ##lot . treatment with anti ##vira ##l drugs demonstrated that the replication could be significantly inhibit ##ed by 0 . 4 ##mg / ml of cy ##stein ##e protein ##ase inhibitor e - 64 ##d , but not by rib ##avi ##rin . the same rep ##lic ##ons containing further del ##eti ##on of the coding regions for non - structural proteins ( ns ##p ) 1 , 2 or 16 confirmed previous observation that ns ##p ##16 , but not ns ##p ##1 or ns ##p ##2 , was essential for efficient viral replication or transcription .  
corona ##virus ##es comprise a large group of emerge ##nt human and animal pathogen ##s , including the highly pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v strains that cause significant mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in infected individuals , especially the elderly . as emerge ##nt viruses may cause ep ##iso ##dic outbreak ##s of disease over time , human samples are limited . systems biology and genetic technologies maximize opportunities for identifying critical host and viral genetic factors that regulate su ##sc ##ept ##ibility and virus - induced disease severity . these approaches provide discovery platforms that highlight and allow targeted confirmation of critical targets for prop ##hyl ##actic ##s and therapeutic ##s , especially critical in an outbreak setting . although poorly understood , it has long been recognized that host regulation of virus - associated disease severity is multi ##genic . the advent of systems genetic and biology resources provides new opportunities for deco ##n ##vo ##lu ##ting the complex genetic interactions and expression networks that regulate pathogen ##ic or protective host response patterns following virus infection . using sar ##s - co ##v as a model , dynamic transcription ##al network changes and disease - associated ph ##eno ##type ##s have been identified in different genetic backgrounds , leading to the promise of population - wide discovery of the under ##pin ##ning ##s of corona ##virus pathogen ##esis .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s co ##v ) is a novel corona ##virus first recognized in 2012 and is associated with severe respiratory disease in humans . virus has been isolated from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in endemic areas , and many camel ##s also have neutral ##izing antibodies against the virus , suggesting that they are likely a reservoir host . in order to better understand the role of camel ##s in virus transmission we experimental ##ly infected 3 adult , male dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s with a human isolate of mer ##s co ##v . all animals developed a transient , upper respiratory tract infection associated with very minor clinical disease . large quantities of infectious virus were isolated from nasal secret ##ions from each animal through 7 days post - in ##oc ##ulation , and viral rna was detected much longer . although our study design was limited to 3 animals , these data indicate that mer ##s co ##v readily in ##fect ##s camel ##s , which shed large amounts of virus and likely can efficiently transmit virus to other camel ##s and humans .  
abstract initial in vitro investigations demonstrated type i inter ##fer ##ons ( if ##ns : if ##n - α , if ##n - β ) to inhibit replication of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , but found the nu ##cle ##osi ##de analogue rib ##avi ##rin ineffective in ve ##ro cells . in this report , rib ##avi ##rin was shown to inhibit sar ##s - co ##v replication in five different cell types of animal or human origin at therapeutic ##ally ac ##hi ##eva ##ble concentrations . since clinical anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity of type i inter ##fer ##ons or rib ##avi ##rin is limited , we investigated the combination of if ##n - β and rib ##avi ##rin . determination of the virus yield indicated highly syn ##er ##gist ##ic anti - sar ##s - co ##v action of the combination suggesting the consideration of rib ##avi ##rin plus if ##n - β for the treatment of sar ##s .  
in marked contrast to their historical classification as relatively harmless , common cold - causing , respiratory pathogen ##s , human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) are associated with more severe clinical complications , as emphasized by the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2003 . still , their precise pathogen ##ic potential is largely unknown , particularly regarding the most recently identified strains hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 , and definite proof for their et ##iology remains a major challenge . this article focuses on the characteristics of the five hc ##ov ##s that are known , and sum ##mar ##izes current knowledge of their pathogen ##ic potential in people , with an emphasis on the interactions between these viruses and their co ##gna ##te receptors on susceptible target cells .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerged corona ##virus that is associated with a severe respiratory disease in humans in the middle east . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological profiles of the mer ##s - co ##v infections suggest zoo ##not ##ic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans . methods this study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - infected patients in saudi arabia , during the last three years ( 2014 – 2016 ) . nasal sw ##ab ##s and serum samples from 58 ##4 dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , 39 sheep , 51 goats , and 2 cattle were collected . nasal samples from camel ##s , sheep , goats , and cattle were examined by real - time reverse - transcription pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) to detect mer ##s - co ##v rna , and the anti - mer ##s elisa ass ##ay was performed to detect camel hume ##ral immune response ( i ##gg ) to mer ##s - co ##v s ##1 antigen infection . the complete genome sequencing of ten mer ##s - co ##v camel isolate ##s and phylogenetic analysis was performed . results the data indicated that seventy - five dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s were positive for mer ##s - co ##v rna ; the virus was not detected in sheep , goats , and cattle . mer ##s - co ##v rna from infected camel ##s was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal sw ##ab ##s obtained from infected camel ##s . anti - mer ##s elisa ass ##ays showed that 70 . 9 % of camel ##s related to human cases had antibodies to mer ##s - co ##v . the full genome sequences of the ten mer ##s - co ##v camel isolate ##s were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger mer ##s - co ##v sequences cluster for human and camel isolate ##s reported form the arabian peninsula . conclusions these findings indicate that camel ##s are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of mer ##s - co ##vs , and they are an important source of human infection with mer ##s .  
abstract a sar ##s vaccine based on a live - at ##ten ##uated ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) rec ##om ##bina ##nt expressing the sar ##s - co ##v s protein provides long - term protection of im ##mun ##ized mice from sar ##s - co ##v infection ( ka ##pad ##ia , s . u . , rose , j . k . , lam ##ira ##nde , e . , vogel , l . , sub ##bara ##o , k . , roberts , a . , 2005 . long - term protection from sar ##s corona ##virus infection conferred by a single im ##mun ##ization with an at ##ten ##uated vs ##v - based vaccine . vi ##rol ##ogy 340 ( 2 ) , 174 – 82 . ) . because it is difficult to obtain regulatory approval of vaccine based on live viruses , we constructed a replication - defective single - cycle vs ##v vector in which we replaced the vs ##v g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( g ) gene with the sar ##s - co ##v s gene . the virus was only able to in ##fect cells when pseudo ##type ##d with the vs ##v g protein . we measured the effectiveness of im ##mun ##ization with the single - cycle vaccine in mice . we found that the vaccine given intra ##mus ##cular ##ly induced a neutral ##izing antibody response to sar ##s - co ##v that was approximately ten - fold greater than that required for the protection from sar ##s - co ##v infection , and significantly greater than that generated by the replication - competent vector expressing sar ##s - co ##v s protein given by the same route . our results , along with earlier studies showing potent induction of t - cell responses by single - cycle vectors , indicate that these vectors are excellent alternatives to live - at ##ten ##uated vs ##v .  
abstract background approximately half of the reported laboratory - confirmed infections of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have occurred in healthcare settings , and healthcare workers constitute over one third of all secondary infections . this study aimed to describe secondary cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death . methods a retrospective analysis was conducted on ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data of laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases reported to the world health organization from september 2012 to 2 june 2018 . we compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non - healthcare workers . multi ##var ##iable log ##istic regression identified risk factors for death . results of the 222 ##3 laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases reported to who , 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non - healthcare workers . compared with non - healthcare workers cases , healthcare workers cases were younger ( p < 0 . 001 ) , more likely to be female ( p < 0 . 001 ) , non - nationals ( p < 0 . 001 ) and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and have fewer como ##rb ##idi ##ties ( p < 0 . 001 ) and higher rates of survival ( p < 0 . 001 ) . year of infection ( 2013 – 2018 ) and having no como ##rb ##idi ##ties were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases . conclusion being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogen ##s , such as mer ##s - co ##v is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in healthcare - associated outbreak ##s . by extension , reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities .  
abstract the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 was the first emergence of an important human pathogen in the 21st century . responding to the epidemic provided clinic ##ians with extensive experience in dia ##gno ##sing and treating a novel respiratory viral disease . in this article , we review the experience of the sar ##s epidemic , focusing on measures taken to identify and isolate patients , prevent the transmission of infection to healthcare workers and develop effective the ##ra ##pies . lessons learned from the sar ##s epidemic will be especially important in responding to the current emergence of another highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus , the agent of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , and to the recently emerging h ##7 ##n ##9 influenza a virus in china . this paper forms part of a symposium in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ” 
summary background middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a new human disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . clinical data on mer ##s - co ##v infections are scarce . we report ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , demographic , clinical , and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infections , identify knowledge gaps , and define research priorities . methods we abstract ##ed and anal ##yse ##d ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , demographic , clinical , and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic , household , community , and health - care - associated mer ##s - co ##v infections reported from saudi arabia between sept 1 , 2012 , and june 15 , 2013 . cases were confirmed as having mer ##s - co ##v by real - time rt - pc ##r . findings 47 individuals ( 46 adults , one child ) with laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v disease were identified ; 36 ( 77 % ) were male ( male : female ratio 3 · 3 : 1 ) . 28 patients died , a 60 % case - fatal ##ity rate . the case - fatal ##ity rate rose with increasing age . only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy ; most patients ( 45 [ 96 % ] ) had underlying como ##rb ##id medical disorders , including diabetes ( 32 [ 68 % ] ) , hyper ##tension ( 16 [ 34 % ] ) , chronic cardiac disease ( 13 [ 28 % ] ) , and chronic renal disease ( 23 [ 49 % ] ) . common symptoms at presentation were fever ( 46 [ 98 % ] ) , fever with chill ##s or rig ##ors ( 41 [ 87 % ] ) , cough ( 39 [ 83 % ] ) , short ##ness of breath ( 34 [ 72 % ] ) , and my ##al ##gia ( 15 [ 32 % ] ) . gas ##tro ##int ##estinal symptoms were also frequent , including dia ##rr ##hoe ##a ( 12 [ 26 % ] ) , vomiting ( ten [ 21 % ] ) , and abdominal pain ( eight [ 17 % ] ) . all patients had abnormal findings on chest radio ##graphy , ranging from subtle to extensive un ##ila ##tera ##l and bilateral abnormalities . laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lac ##tate de ##hy ##dro ##genase ( 23 [ 49 % ] ) and as ##par ##tate amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( seven [ 15 % ] ) and th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##enia ( 17 [ 36 % ] ) and l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia ( 16 [ 34 % ] ) . interpretation disease caused by mer ##s - co ##v presents with a wide range of clinical manifestation ##s and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical como ##rb ##idi ##ties . major
abstract in this study , we report a one step quantitative rt - pc ##r ass ##ay for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) diagnosis . the overall detection rate for clinical samples collected from days 1 to 9 of disease onset is 86 . 2 % and the specific ##ity of the ass ##ay is 100 % . to detect false negative results due to pc ##r inhibitors or faulty rna extraction , we have further modified this one step rt - pc ##r ass ##ay for simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) and 18 ##s rib ##osomal rna ( rr ##na ) as an internal positive control .  
summary the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has resulted in > 90 , 000 infections and > 3 , 000 deaths . corona ##virus spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies . we show that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s uses ace ##2 to enter cells and that the receptor - binding domains of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s and sar ##s - co ##v s bind with similar af ##fin ##ities to human ace ##2 , co ##rre ##lating with the efficient spread of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 among humans . we found that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein harbor ##s a fur ##in cleavage site at the boundary between the s ##1 / s ##2 subunit ##s , which is processed during bio ##genesis and sets this virus apart from sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - related co ##vs . we determined cry ##o - em structures of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s ec ##to ##dom ##ain trim ##er , providing a blue ##print for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry . finally , we demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v s mu ##rine poly ##cl ##onal antibodies potent ##ly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 s mediated entry into cells , indicating that cross - neutral ##izing antibodies targeting conserved s ep ##ito ##pes can be eli ##cite ##d upon va ##cci ##nation .  
in the face of the worldwide threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) to human life , some of the most urgent challenges are to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for early diagnosis of this disease as well as to create a safe anti - viral vaccine for prevention . to these ends , we investigated the antigen ##ici ##ty of the spike protein ( s protein ) , a major structural protein in the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . based upon the theoretical analysis for hydro ##phobic ##ity of the s protein , 18 peptide ##s were synthesized . using enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , these peptide ##s were screened in the sera from sar ##s patients . according to these results , two fragments of the s gene were amplified by pc ##r and clone ##d into pet - 32 ##a . both s fragments were expressed in the b ##l - 21 strain and further pu ##rified with an affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy . these rec ##om ##bina ##nt s fragments were confirmed to have positive cross - reactions with sar ##s sera , either by western b ##lot or by elisa . our results demonstrated that the potential ep ##ito ##pe regions were located at cod ##ons 46 ##9 – 88 ##2 in the s protein , and one ep ##ito ##pe site was located at cod ##ons 59 ##9 – 620 . identification of antigen ##ic regions in the sar ##s - co ##v s protein may be important for the functional studies of this virus or the development of clinical diagnosis .  
abstract background : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infection caused by a novel corona ##virus known as sar ##s - co ##v , characterized by an over - ex ##uber ##ant immune response with lung l ##ym ##ph ##omo ##non ##uc ##lea ##r cells in ##filtration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication . this study is aimed at investigating the capability of sar ##s - co ##v to activate if ##n - α and - γ expression in l ##ym ##ph ##omo ##no ##cytes ( p ##bm ##c ) from healthy donors , evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation . results : sar ##s - co ##v virus is able to induce both if ##n - α and - γ mrna accumulation and protein release in a dose - dependent manner , moi 10 being the most effective . the time course curve indicated that if ##n - α mrna induction peaked at 24 h . p . i , . whereas if ##n - γ mrna was still increasing at 48 h . p . i . released if ##n ( both types ) reached a plateau after 24 – 48 h . p . i . and remained rather stable over a 5 - day period . a transient peak of negative strand viral rna was detected after 1 – 2 days of infection , but neither infectious virus pro ##geny yield nor newly produced viral gen ##omic rna could be evidenced in infected cultures , even after prolonged observation time ( up to 13 days ) . co ##cu ##lt ##ivation of p ##bm ##c with fixed sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eli ##cit ##ing if ##n - α and - γ induction . a combination of if ##n - α and - γ strongly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication in ve ##ro cells , while the single cy ##tok ##ines were much less effective . conclusions : this study provides evidence that sar ##s - co ##v is able to induce in normal p ##bm ##c a coordinate induction of if ##n - α and - γ gene expression . virus replication is not necessary for if ##n induction since efficient if ##n expression could be obtained also by the co ##cu ##lt ##ivation of normal p ##bm ##c with fixed sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . con ##com ##itan ##t activation of if ##n - α and - γ gene expression by sar ##s - co ##v in vivo may be relevant for the pathogen ##esis of the disease , both for the possible involvement in im ##mun ##ome ##dia ##ted damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v replication as a result of combined cy ##tok ##ine action .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infections continue to be a serious emerging disease problem internationally with well over 1000 cases and a major outbreak outside of the middle east region . while the hypothesis that dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are the likely major source of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans is gaining acceptance , conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host ( s ) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s were imported to australia , principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabit ##ing extensive parts of the continent . here we report that during a focus ##sed surveillance study , no ser ##ological evidence was found for the presence of mer ##s - co ##v in the camel ##s in the australian population . this finding presents various h ##yp ##oth ##eses about the timing of the emergence and spread of mer ##s - co ##v throughout populations of camel ##s in africa and asia , which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camel ##s from the original source region , which we have in ##fer ##red was mainly northwestern pakistan . in addition , we identify bat species which overlap ( or neighbour ) the range of the australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying co ##vs of the same lineage as mer ##s - co ##v . both of these proposed follow - on studies are examples of “ pro ##active surveillance ” , a concept that has particular relevance to a one health approach to emerging zoo ##not ##ic diseases with a complex ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and ae ##ti ##ology .  
background many outbreak ##s of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) have occurred in health care settings and involved health care workers ( hc ##ws ) . we describe the occurrence of an outbreak among hc ##ws and attempt to character ##ize at - risk exposure ##s to improve future infection control interventions . methods this study included an index case and all hc ##w contacts . all contacts were screened for mer ##s - co ##v using polymer ##ase chain reaction . results during the study period in 2015 , the index case was a 30 - year - old filipino nurse who had a history of un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure to a mer ##s - co ##v – positive case on may 15 , 2015 , and had multiple negative tests for mer ##s - co ##v . weeks later , she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and mer ##s - co ##v infection . a total of 73 staff were qu ##aran ##tine ##d for 14 days , and nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s were taken on days 2 , 5 , and 12 post ##ex ##po ##sure . of those contacts , 3 ( 4 % ) were confirmed positive for mer ##s - co ##v . an additional 18 staff were qu ##aran ##tine ##d and had mer ##s - co ##v sw ##ab ##s . a fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12 . subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth - generation transmission . only 7 ( 4 . 5 % ) of the total 153 contacts were positive for mer ##s - co ##v . conclusions the role of hc ##ws in mer ##s - co ##v transmission is complex . although most mer ##s - co ##v – infected hc ##ws are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or have mild disease , fatal infections can occur and hc ##ws can play a major role in prop ##aga ##ting health care facility outbreak ##s . this investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of hc ##ws in mer ##s - co ##v transmission in health care outbreak ##s , especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposure ##s , who to test , and the frequency of mer ##s - co ##v testing ; criteria for who to qu ##aran ##tine and for how long ; and clearance and return to active duty criteria .  
a zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus , labeled as 2019 - nc ##ov by the world health organization ( who ) , has been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in wu ##han , china , at the end of 2019 . although 2019 - nc ##ov can cause a severe respiratory illness like sar ##s and mer ##s , evidence from clinics suggested that 2019 - nc ##ov is generally less pathogen ##ic than sar ##s - co ##v , and much less than mer ##s - co ##v . the trans ##mis ##sibility of 2019 - nc ##ov is still debated and needs to be further assessed . to avoid the 2019 - nc ##ov outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pan ##de ##mic and to minimize the mortality rate , china activated emergency response procedures , but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to ref ##ine the risk assessment and response . here , the current knowledge in 2019 - nc ##ov pathogen ##ici ##ty and trans ##mis ##sibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses , and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted .  
during the past two decades , three zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es have been identified as the cause of large - scale disease outbreak ##s – severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) , and sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hea syndrome ( sad ##s ) . sar ##s and mer ##s emerged in 2003 and 2012 , respectively , and caused a worldwide pan ##de ##mic that claimed thousands of human lives , while sad ##s struck the sw ##ine industry in 2017 . they have common characteristics , such as they are all highly pathogen ##ic to humans or livestock , their agents originated from bats , and two of them originated in china . thus , it is highly likely that future sar ##s - or mer ##s - like corona ##virus outbreak ##s will originate from bats , and there is an increased probability that this will occur in china . therefore , the investigation of bat corona ##virus ##es becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning signs , which in turn minimize ##s the impact of such future outbreak ##s in china . the purpose of the review is to sum ##mar ##ize the current knowledge on viral diversity , reservoir hosts , and the geographical distributions of bat corona ##virus ##es in china , and eventually we aim to predict virus hot ##sp ##ots and their cross - species transmission potential .  
abstract 3 ##c - like protein ##ase of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus has been demonstrated to be a key target for drug design against sar ##s . the interaction between sar ##s corona ##virus 3 ##c - like ( 3 ##cl ) protein ##ase and an oct ##ape ##pt ##ide interface inhibitor was studied by affinity cap ##illa ##ry electro ##ph ##ores ##is ( ace ) . the binding constant ##s were estimated by the change of migration time of the anal ##yte ##s in the buffer solution containing different concentrations of sar ##s 3 ##cl protein ##ase . the results showed that sar ##s 3 ##cl protein ##ase was able to complex with the oct ##ape ##pt ##ide competitive ##ly , with binding constant ##s of 2 . 44 ##× ##10 ##4 m ##−1 at 20 ##° ##c and 2 . 11 ##× ##10 ##4 m ##−1 at 37 ##° ##c . in addition , the the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic parameters de ##duced reveal that hydro ##phobic interaction might play major roles , along with electro ##static force , in the binding process . the ace method used here could be developed to be an effective and simple way of applying large - scale drug screening and evaluation .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has two major functions : interacting with the receptor to media ##te virus entry and inducing protective immunity . coincide ##ntly , the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d , residues 318 – 510 ) of sar - co ##v s protein is a major antigen ##ic site to induce neutral ##izing antibodies . here , we used rb ##d - fc , a fusion protein containing the rb ##d and human i ##gg ##1 fc , as a model in the studies and found that a single amino acid substitution in the rb ##d ( r ##44 ##1 ##a ) could ab ##olis ##h the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of rb ##d to induce neutral ##izing antibodies in im ##mun ##ized mice and rabbits . with a panel of anti - rb ##d mab ##s as probe ##s , we observed that r ##44 ##1 ##a substitution was able to disrupt the majority of neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes in the rb ##d , suggesting that this residue is critical for the antigen ##ic structure responsible for inducing protective immune responses . we also demonstrated that the rb ##d - fc bearing r ##44 ##1 ##a mutation could not bind to soluble and cell - associated ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v and failed to block s protein - mediated pseudo ##virus entry , indicating that this point mutation also disrupted the receptor - binding motif ( rb ##m ) in the rb ##d . taken together , these data provide direct evidence to show that a single amino acid residue at key position in the rb ##d can determine the major function of sar ##s - co ##v s protein and imply for designing sar ##s vaccines and therapeutic ##s .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) 3a locus en ##codes a 274 a . a . novel protein , and its expression has been confirmed in sar ##s patients . to study functional roles of 3a , we established a trans ##genic fly model for the sar ##s - co ##v 3a gene . mis ##ex ##press ##ion of 3a in dr ##oso ##phila caused a dominant rough eye ph ##eno ##type . using a specific mono ##cl ##onal antibody , we demonstrated that the 3a protein displayed a pun ##cta ##te cy ##top ##las ##mic local ##ization in dr ##oso ##phila as in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . we provide genetic evidence to support that 3a is functional ##ly related to cl ##ath ##rin - mediated end ##oc ##yt ##osis . we further found that 3a mis ##ex ##press ##ion induce ##s ap ##op ##tosis , which could be mod ##ulated by cellular cy ##to ##chrome c levels and cas ##pas ##e activity . from a forward genetic screen , 78 dominant 3a modifying lo ##ci were recovered and the identity of these mod ##ifiers revealed that the severity of the 3a - induced rough eye ph ##eno ##type depends on multiple cellular processes including gene transcription ##al regulation .  
summary sar ##s and travel are intricate ##ly inter ##link ##ed . travelers belonged to those primarily affected in the early stages of the outbreak , travelers became vectors of the disease , and finally , travel and tourism themselves became the victims . the outbreak of sar ##s created international anxiety because of its novelty , its ease of transmission in certain settings , and the speed of its spread through jet travel , combined with extensive media coverage . the psychological impacts of sar ##s , coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities , have diminished international travel in 2003 , far beyond the limitations to truly sar ##s hit areas . governments and press , especially in non sar ##s affected areas , have been slow to strike the right balance between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context . screening at airport entry points is costly , has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself . the low yield in detecting sar ##s is most likely due to a combination of factors , such as travel advisor ##ies which resulted in reduced travel to and from sar ##s affected areas , implementation of effective pre - departure screening at airports in sar ##s - hit countries , and a rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was finally introduced . rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases , investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system . if sar ##s re ##oc ##cu ##rs , the subsequent outbreak will be smaller and more easily contained if the lessons learnt from the recent epidemic are applied . lessons learnt during the outbreak in relation to international travel will be discussed .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was diagnosed in more than 84 ##37 patients in 25 countries between february and july 2003 . during this period the world health organisation issued a global alert about sar ##s and together with the centre for disease control have coordinated their efforts to investigate its pathogen ##esis and treatment . the outbreak in hong kong has been dramatic due to its geographical proximity with guangdong province , china where the first case of sar ##s was reported . sar ##s has been described as a rapidly progressive , sometimes fatal pneumonia with a case fatal ##ity rate of 7 . 6 % requiring intensive care . the four case reports illustrate a number of important points concerning the recognition , treatment , management and prevention of sar ##s , and highlights the importance of considering vi ##gil ##ant assessment and monitoring of patients with sar ##s . the purpose of this paper is to share our experiences in caring for critically ill patients with sar ##s in the intensive care unit to nurses globally in order to reduce sar ##s ’ mor ##bid ##ity and mortality as well as to protect nurses and other healthcare workers from this disease that is so far threatening the community at large .  
objective to evaluate the in ##fect ##ivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) during its inc ##uba ##tion period by investigating chains of transmission and individuals isolated for medical observation with a view to providing scientific evidence for up ##dating protocols of medical isolation . methods individuals related with the two sar ##s chains of transmission in beijing in 2003 and a group of individuals isolated for medical observation in hai ##dian district of beijing during the sar ##s outbreak were selected as subjects of study . contact ##ors with sar ##s patients and those with sy ##mpt ##om development following the contacts were investigated via question ##naire . serum samples were collected from super transmitters and tested for sar ##s - co ##v antibody by neutral ##ization test and enzyme linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) . results a total of 1 112 contact ##ors were investigated in three surveys . of them , 66 ##9 had a history of close contact with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s patients , 101 developed symptoms with a rate of 15 . 1 % , 36 ##3 had a history of close contact with patients in their inc ##uba ##tion period , none of whom developed symptoms ( 0 % ) . serum samples were collected from 32 highly - exposed individuals , of whom 13 developing sar ##s symptoms after contact had serum samples positive for sar ##s - co ##v antibody . samples collected from the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic contact ##ors were all negative for sar ##s - co ##v antibody . conclusion sar ##s cases are infectious only during their sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic period and are non - infectious during the inc ##uba ##tion period . isolation for medical observation should be placed for individuals who are in close contact with sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic sar ##s patients . the results of our study are of decisive significance for the ministry of health to the definition of sar ##s close contact ##or .  
abstract nu ##cle ##osi ##de analogue ##s that have 6 - ch ##lor ##op ##uri ##ne as the nu ##cle ##ob ##ase were synthesized and evaluated for anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity by plaque reduction and yield reduction ass ##ays in order to develop novel anti - sar ##s - co ##v agents . among these analogue ##s , two compounds , namely , 1 and 11 , exhibited promising anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity that was comparable to those of mi ##zo ##ri ##bine and rib ##avi ##rin , which are known anti - sar ##s - co ##v agents . moreover , we observed several sar trends such as the anti ##vira ##l effects of the 6 - ch ##lor ##op ##uri ##ne moi ##ety , un ##pro ##tec ##ted 5 ′ - hydro ##xy ##l group and benz ##oy ##lated 5 ′ - hydro ##xy ##l group .  
abstract ph ##eno ##thi ##azi ##ne and derivatives were tested for inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v replication . ph ##eno ##thi ##azi ##ne slightly inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication in a neutral red ( nr ) up ##take ass ##ay . adding a prop ##yla ##min ##o group to give prom ##azi ##ne reduced virus yields ( v ##yr ass ##ay ) with an ec ##90 = 8 . 3 ##± ##2 . 8 ##μ ##m , but without select ##ivity . various substitution ##s in the basic ph ##eno ##thi ##azi ##ne structure did not promote efficacy . ph ##ena ##zine et ##hos ##ulf ##ate was the most potent compound by v ##yr ass ##ay ( ec ##90 = 6 . 1 ##± ##4 . 3 ##μ ##m ) . all compounds were toxic ( ic ##50 = 6 . 6 – 74 . 5 ##μ ##m ) except for ph ##eno ##xa ##thi ##in ( ic ##50 = 85 ##8 ##± ##20 ##8 ##μ ##m ) and 10 - ( alpha - diet ##hyl ##ami ##no - prop ##ion ##yl ) ph ##eno ##thi ##azi ##ne · hc ##l ( ic ##50 = 195 ##± ##7 ##1 . 2 ##μ ##m ) . consequently , none were selective inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v replication ( si values < 1 – 3 . 3 ##μ ##m ) . these data porte ##nded the poor efficacy of prom ##azi ##ne in a sar ##s - co ##v mouse lung replication model . intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##l treatment with prom ##azi ##ne using a prop ##hyl ##actic ( − ##4 ##h ) / therapeutic regime ##n of 1 , 10 , or 50 ##mg / ( kg ##day ) did not reduce virus lung ti ##ters at day 3 , yet prolonged virus replication to 14 days . similar therapeutic prom ##azi ##ne doses were not e ##ffi ##ca ##cious . thus , prom ##azi ##ne did not affect sar ##s - co ##v replication in vitro or in vivo , nor were any other ph ##eno ##thi ##azi ##nes e ##ffi ##ca ##cious in reducing virus replication . therefore , treating sar ##s infections with compounds like prom ##azi ##ne is not warrant ##ed .  
background this study aimed to identify nurses ' experiences of care for patients with middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . their experiences can be useful to establish a safer healthcare system in preparation for infectious disease outbreak ##s . methods data were collected through in - depth individual interviews and analyzed using cola ##iz ##zi ' s ph ##eno ##men ##ological method . participants were 12 nurses . results nurses ' experiences of care for patients with mer ##s - co ##v were categorized as follows : “ going into a dangerous field , ” “ strong pressure because of mer ##s - co ##v , ” “ the strength that make me endure , ” “ growth as a nurse , ” and “ remaining task . ” conclusions it is necessary to examine the difficulties and demands of healthcare providers for establishing a safe healthcare system to respond effectively when national disasters occur . in addition , it is necessary to develop strategies to protect healthcare providers from severe physical and psychological stress .  
abstract ni ##tric oxide is an important molecule playing a key role in a broad range of biological process such as ne ##uro ##tra ##ns ##mission , va ##so ##di ##lat ##ation and immune responses . while the anti - micro ##bio ##logical properties of ni ##tric oxide - derived reactive nitrogen intermediate ##s ( rn ##i ) such as per ##ox ##yn ##it ##rite , are known , the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) belongs to the family corona ##vir ##idae , was first identified during 2002 - 2003 . mortality in sar ##s patients ranges from between 6 to 55 % . we have previously shown that ni ##tric oxide inhibit ##s the replication cycle of sar ##s - co ##v in vitro by an unknown mechanism . in this study , we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of ni ##tric oxide against sar ##s - co ##v . we found that per ##ox ##yn ##it ##rite , an intermediate product of ni ##tric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of no with super ##oxide , has no effect on the replication cycle of sar ##s - co ##v , suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effect ##ed by no or a derivative other than per ##ox ##yn ##it ##rite . most interesting ##ly , we found that no inhibit ##s the replication of sar ##s - co ##v by two distinct mechanisms . firstly , no or its derivatives cause a reduction in the palm ##ito ##yla ##tion of nas ##cent ##ly expressed spike ( s ) protein which affects the fusion between the s protein and its co ##gna ##te receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 . secondly , no or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral rna production in the early steps of viral replication , and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses encoded in or ##f ##1 ##a of sar ##s - co ##v .  
summary the major mechanism of antibody - mediated neutral ##ization of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) involves competition with the cellular receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) for binding to the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . here , we report a unique ep ##ito ##pe and unusual neutral ##izing mechanism of the isolated human antibody mer ##s - 4 . structurally , mer ##s - 4 approached the rb ##d from the outside of the rb ##d - d ##pp ##4 binding interface . such binding resulted in the folding of the β ##5 - β ##6 loop toward a shallow groove on the rb ##d interface critical for acc ##om ##mo ##dating d ##pp ##4 . the key residues for binding are identified through site - directed mu ##tage ##nes ##is . structural modeling revealed that mer ##s - 4 binds to rb ##d only in the “ up ” position in the s trim ##er . furthermore , mer ##s - 4 demonstrated syn ##ergy with several reported antibodies . these results indicate that mer ##s - 4 neutral ##izes mer ##s - co ##v by indirect rather than direct competition with d ##pp ##4 . this mechanism provides a valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract early detection and identification of sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients and actions to prevent transmission are absolutely critical to prevent another sar ##s outbreak . antibodies that specifically recognize the sar ##s - co ##v spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins may provide a rapid screening method to allow accurate identification and isolation of patients with the virus early in their infection . for this reason , we raised peptide - induced poly ##cl ##onal antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v spike protein and poly ##cl ##onal antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein using 6 ##× his nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein . western b ##lot analysis and im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent stain ##ing showed that these antibodies specifically recognized sar ##s - co ##v .  
summary context live - animal markets ( wet markets ) provide a source of ve ##rte ##brate and in ##vert ##eb ##rate animals for customers in tropical and subtropical regions of the world . wet markets sell live poultry , fish , reptiles , and mammals of every kind . live - poultry markets ( mostly chicken , pigeon , qu ##ail , ducks , geese , and a wide range of exotic wild - caught and farm - raised f ##ow ##l ) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red - meat animals , but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation . despite the widespread availability of affordable ref ##ri ##ger ##ation , many asian people prefer live animals for fresh produce . wet markets are widespread in asian countries and in countries where asian people have migrated . live - poultry markets were the source of the h ##5 ##n ##1 bird - influenza virus that transmitted to and killed six of 18 ##pe ##ople in hong kong . starting point yi gu ##an and colleagues ( science 2003 ; 302 : 276 – 78 ) recently reported the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) from himalayan palm ci ##vet ##s ( pa ##gun ##a la ##rva ##ta ) in wet markets in shen ##zen , southern china . these researchers also found ser ##ological evidence of infection in ra ##cco ##on dogs ( nyc ##ter ##eu ##tes pro - cu ##yo ##in ##bo ##ides ) . ser ##ological evidence for sar ##s co ##v in human beings working in these markets , taken together with the earliest cases of sar ##s in restaurant workers , supports the contention of a potential zoo ##not ##ic origin for sar ##s . where next ? will sar ##s re ##app ##ear ? this question confronts public - health officials worldwide , particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of sar ##s , including china , taiwan , and canada . will the virus re - emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with sar ##s co ##v , or are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections ongoing in human beings ? similar questions can be asked about a pan ##de ##mic of influenza that is probably imminent . knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early - warning system to detect the re ##app ##ear ##ance of sar ##s or pan ##de ##mic influenza .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a viral respiratory infection , which ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infection to severe pneumonia and multi ##org ##an failure , caused by a novel corona ##virus named middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . majority of cases have been reported from saudi arabia . mer ##s cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreak ##s . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are thought to be a host for mer ##s - co ##v . direct contact with dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s within 14 ##day ##s prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for mer ##s . diagnosis of mer ##s is based on a positive real - time reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) , obtained from a respiratory specimen . the main ##sta ##y of management of mer ##s - co ##v infection is supportive care . there is no specific anti ##vira ##l therapy for mer ##s - co ##v infection at present , although several mod ##ali ##ties of treatment options have been examined or are under investigation .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a new highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es that emerged in jed ##dah and saudi arabia and has quickly spread to other countries in middle east , europe and north africa since 2012 . up to 17 december 2014 , it has infected at least 93 ##8 people with a fatal ##ity rate of about 36 % globally . this has resulted in an urgent need to identify anti ##vira ##l drugs that are active against mer ##s - co ##v . the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) of mer ##s - co ##v represents an important anti ##vira ##l target as it is not only essential for viral mat ##uration , but also ant ##ago ##ni ##zes inter ##fer ##on stimulation of the host via its de ##ub ##iq ##uit ##ination activity . here , we report the discovery that two sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro inhibitors , 6 - mer ##cap ##top ##uri ##ne ( 6 ##mp ) and 6 - th ##io ##gua ##nine ( 6 ##t ##g ) , as well as the im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive drug my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid , are able to inhibit mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . their inhibition mechanisms and mutually binding syn ##er ##gist ##ic effect were also investigated . our results identify for the first time three inhibitors targeting mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro and these can now be used as lead compounds for further anti ##vira ##l drug development .  
abstract passive therapy with neutral ##izing human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) could be an effective therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . utilizing the human im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin trans ##genic mouse , x ##eno ##mous ##e ##® , we produced fully human sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein specific antibodies . antibodies were examined for react ##ivity against a rec ##om ##bina ##nt s ##1 protein , to which 200 antibodies reacted . twenty - seven antibodies neutral ##ized 200 ##tc ##id ##50 sar ##s - co ##v ( urban ##i ) . additionally , 57 neutral ##izing antibodies were found that are likely specific to s ##2 . mapping of the binding region was achieved with several s ##1 rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins . most s ##1 reactive neutral ##izing mab ##s bound to the rb ##d , aa 318 – 510 . however , two s ##1 specific mab ##s reacted with a domain upstream of the rb ##d between aa 12 and 261 . im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin gene sequence analyses suggested at least 8 different binding specific ##ities . unique human mab ##s could be used as a cocktail that would simultaneously target several neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes and prevent emergence of escape mutants .  
abstract previously , we have identified a truncated antigen ##ic fragment named protein c [ 441 to 700 amino acids ( a . a . ) ] as the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant fragment of spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we have now successfully expressed protein c using the ba ##cu ##lov ##irus system in s . fr ##ug ##ipe ##rda ( sf - 9 ) cells . this rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus expressing protein c was first characterized using five sar ##s con ##vale ##scent human sera and five normal human sera . the results showed that protein c is an authentic antigen against sar ##s - co ##v antibody . our spike protein - based im ##mun ##of ##lou ##res ##cence ass ##ay ( if ##a ) based on this rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus - sf - 9 system was further assessed with a panel of 163 clinical samples collected during the sar ##s epidemic in singapore , which include samples from 21 clinical ##ly confirmed sar ##s , 42 non - sar ##s patient sera , and 100 normal sera . the results were compared to a commercial sar ##s if ##a kit ( euro ##im ##mun , germany ) and a conventional if ##a test performed in singapore general hospital . all of the 21 sar ##s - positive serum samples could be recognized by our if ##a , giving a specific ##ity and sensitivity of 100 % , which was compatible with both whole virus - based if ##a ass ##ays . no cross - react ##ivity with serum samples against infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) and trans ##missible gas ##tro ##enter ##itis virus ( t ##ge ##v ) were detected in our ass ##ays . thus , our spike protein - based if ##a could offer a safer procedure which can be performed in a bs ##l - 2 laboratory as it could mimic the whole virus based - if ##a without any loss of sensitivity and specific ##ity . it is also more user - friendly and cost - effective than the whole virus - based if ##a .  
abstract the emergence of the highly pathogen ##ic sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has reign ##ited interest in corona ##virus biology and pathogen ##esis . an emerging theme in corona ##virus pathogen ##esis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system , specifically the innate immune system , functions as a key deter ##mina ##nt in regulating vi ##ru ##lence and disease outcomes . using sar ##s - co ##v as a model , we will review the current knowledge of the inter ##play between corona ##virus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo , and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products ant ##ago ##ni ##ze the host innate immune response in cell culture models . our data suggests that the sar ##s - co ##v uses specific strategies to evade and ant ##ago ##ni ##ze the sensing and signaling arms of the inter ##fer ##on pathway . we sum ##mar ##ize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing corona ##virus pathogen ##esis and vi ##ru ##lence , and the development of severe disease in humans and animals .  
abstract we have investigated novel vaccine strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v using cd ##na construct ##s encoding the structural antigen ##s : ( s ) , ( m ) , ( e ) , or ( n ) protein , derived from sar ##s co ##v . p ##bl from healthy human volunteers were administered i . p . into il - 2 receptor γ - chain disrupted sci ##d mice , and sci ##d - p ##bl / hu mice were constructed . these mice can be used to analyze the human immune response in vivo . sar ##s m dna vaccine and n dna vaccine induced human ct ##l specific for sar ##s co ##v antigen ##s . alternatively , sar ##s m dna vaccines inducing human neutral ##izing antibodies and human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies against sar ##s co ##v are now being developed . these results show that these vaccines can induce virus - specific immune responses and should provide a useful tool for development of protective and therapeutic vaccines .  
abstract background : in march 2003 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic was recognized in china . the disease quickly spread to countries around the world and was transmitted in healthcare settings . infection control professionals had to formula ##te a response to potential cases of sar ##s presenting to healthcare facilities . objective : to formula ##te and operational ##ize a plan for education and training of staff and to ensure availability of personal protective equipment ( pp ##e ) and adherence to infection control protocols to prevent sar ##s transmission in a large urban healthcare institution . methods : a multi ##dis ##ci ##plin ##ary task force was charged with maintaining up - to - date knowledge about the sar ##s epidemic and providing education and training to staff in the hospital and outlying clinics . signage for sar ##s tri ##age and sar ##s isolation was created . policies and check ##lists were developed for designated patient areas , and sar ##s carts and boxes stocked with pp ##e were obtained for these areas . a new “ observer ” role was created to ensure adherence to isolation procedures when caring for sar ##s patients . an educational video was made for distribution to healthcare workers . results : the sar ##s task force developed a co ##hesive package of policies , procedures , signage , and patient education in multiple languages . we developed a system to supply pp ##e and education to staff who might care for sar ##s patients . a new video will make staff education more accessible , especially for those working off - site or during non ##tra ##ditional hours . conclusion : the sar ##s task force responded to an emerging infectious threat and is a model for continued response to potential biological emergencies .  
summary the open reading frame ( or ##f ) 7 ##a of the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) en ##codes a unique type i trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein of unknown function . we have determined the 1 . 8 a resolution crystal structure of the n - terminal ec ##to ##dom ##ain of or ##f ##7 ##a , revealing a compact seven - stranded β sandwich unexpectedly similar in fold and topology to members of the i ##g superfamily . we also demonstrate that , in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells , the or ##f ##7 ##a protein is expressed and retained intra ##cellular ##ly . con ##fo ##cal microscopy studies using or ##f ##7 ##a and or ##f ##7 ##a / cd ##4 chi ##mer ##as imp ##lica ##te the short cy ##top ##las ##mic tail and trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain in trafficking of the protein within the end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum and go ##l ##gi network . taken together , our findings provide a structural and cellular framework in which to explore the role of or ##f ##7 ##a in sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis .  
summary middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a novel single - stranded , positive - sense rna beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , hosts for mer ##s - co ##v , are implicated in direct or indirect transmission to human beings , although the exact mode of transmission is unknown . the virus was first isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in june , 2012 , in jed ##dah , saudi arabia . as of may 31 , 2015 , 118 ##0 laboratory - confirmed cases ( 48 ##3 deaths ; 40 % mortality ) have been reported to who . both community - acquired and hospital - acquired cases have been reported with little human - to - human transmission reported in the community . although most cases of mer ##s have occurred in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates , cases have been reported in europe , the usa , and asia in people who travelled from the middle east or their contacts . clinical features of mer ##s range from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi ##org ##an failure resulting in death , especially in individuals with underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ties . no specific drug treatment exists for mer ##s and infection prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent spread in health - care facilities . mer ##s - co ##v continues to be an endemic , low - level public health threat . however , the virus could mu ##tate to have increased inter ##hum ##an trans ##mis ##sibility , increasing its pan ##de ##mic potential .  
abstract an enhanced polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) ass ##ay to detect the corona ##virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was developed in which a target gene pre - amp ##li ##fication step preceded ta ##q ##man real - time fluorescent pc ##r . clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable sar ##s cases and analyzed by conventional pc ##r followed by ag ##aro ##se gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is , conventional ta ##q ##man real - time pc ##r , and our enhanced ta ##q ##man real - time pc ##r ass ##ays . an amp ##lic ##on of the size expected from sar ##s - co ##v was obtained from 28 / 120 samples using the enhanced real - time pc ##r method . conventional pc ##r and real - time pc ##r alone identified fewer sar ##s - co ##v positive cases . results were confirmed by viral culture in 3 / 28 cases . the limit of detection of the enhanced real - time pc ##r method was 102 - fold higher than the standard real - time pc ##r ass ##ay and 107 - fold higher than conventional pc ##r methods . the increased sensitivity of the ass ##ay may help control the spread of the disease during future sar ##s outbreak ##s .  
summary middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a lethal zoo ##nosis that causes death in 35 · 7 % of cases . as of feb 28 , 2018 , 218 ##2 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection ( with 77 ##9 deaths ) in 27 countries were reported to who worldwide , with most being reported in saudi arabia ( 1807 cases with 70 ##5 deaths ) . mer ##s - co ##v features prominently in the who blue ##print list of priority pathogen ##s that threaten global health security . although primary transmission of mer ##s - co ##v to human beings is linked to exposure to dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s ( camel ##us dr ##ome ##dar ##ius ) , the exact mode by which mer ##s - co ##v infection is acquired remains und ##efined . up to 50 % of mer ##s - co ##v cases in saudi arabia have been classified as secondary , occurring from human - to - human transmission through contact with as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic individuals infected with mer ##s - co ##v . hospital outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v are a hallmark of mer ##s - co ##v infection . the clinical features associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection are not mer ##s - specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections . thus , the diagnosis of mer ##s can easily be missed , unless the doctor or health - care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for mer ##s - co ##v . the largest outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v outside the arabian peninsula occurred in south korea in may , 2015 , resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths . this outbreak was caused by a traveller with und ##ia ##gno ##sed mer ##s - co ##v infection who became ill after returning to seoul from a trip to the middle east . the traveller visited several health facilities in south korea , transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made . with 10 million pilgrims visiting saudi arabia each year from 182 countries , watch ##ful surveillance by public health systems , and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of mer ##s - co ##v infection is essential . in this review , we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , deter ##mina ##nts , and risk factors of primary , household , and nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of mer ##s - co ##v , and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is caused by a novel corona ##virus termed sar ##s - co ##v . no anti ##vira ##l treatment has been established so far . inter ##fer ##ons are cy ##tok ##ines which induce the synthesis of several anti ##vira ##lly active proteins in the cell . in this study , we demonstrated that multiplication of sar ##s - co ##v in cell culture can be strongly inhibit ##ed by pre ##tre ##at ##ment with inter ##fer ##on - beta . inter ##fer ##on - alpha and inter ##fer ##on - gamma , by contrast , were less effective . the human mx ##a protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by inter ##fer ##on - beta . nevertheless , no interference with sar ##s - co ##v replication was observed in ve ##ro cells stab ##ly expressing mx ##a . therefore , other inter ##fer ##on - induced proteins must be responsible for the strong inhibitor ##y effect of inter ##fer ##on - beta against sar ##s - co ##v .  
inc ##e december 2019 , an outbreak of the novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infection has spread rapidly in wu ##han , china [ 1 ] 1 . over a month since the outbreak , more than 13 , 000 patients with co ##vid - 19 have be cured and discharged from hospital until now . for the clinical cure criteria in china , twice successive negative results of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detection are the important index , in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and ct scan [ 2 ] . in the present work , we reported that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid was still detect ##able in sp ##ut ##um obtained by ne ##bu ##lization from a cured patient . on january 22 , a 49 - year - old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic . throat sw ##ab detection was positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid by real - time rt - pc ##r . subsequently , the patient was diagnosed with co ##vid - 19 according to the diagnostic criteria [ 2 ] as follows ( 1 ) : the positive result of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detection ( 2 ) ; a history of short stay in wu ##han within 14 days ; and ( 3 ) symptoms of fever , and multiple patch ##y areas of ground - glass op ##ac ##ity on ct scan . after the active treatment , the patient recovered from fever and other respiratory symptoms on february 4 . on february 9 and february 10 , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detection was successively negative in his throat sw ##ab samples . the ct scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs . both the results of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid detection and ct scans indicated a recovery trend , and the patient was ready for discharge . on february 13 , the throat sw ##ab and sp ##ut ##um by ne ##bu ##lization were collected before the patient was discharged . notably , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 nuclei ##c acid was still detected in sp ##ut ##um from the patient although negative result of throat sw ##ab detection .  
abstract while the 2002 – 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) resulted in 77 ##4 deaths , patients who were affected with mild pulmonary symptoms successfully recovered . the objective of the present work was to identify , using sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) mouse infection models , immune factors responsible for clearing of the virus . the elimination of pulmonary sar ##s - co ##v infection required the activation of b cells by cd ##4 + t cells . furthermore , passive im ##mun ##ization ( post - infection ) with homo ##log ##ous ( mu ##rine ) anti - sar ##s - co ##v anti ##ser ##um showed greater elimination efficacy against sar ##s - co ##v than that with het ##ero ##log ##ous ( rabbit ) anti ##ser ##um , despite the use of equivalent ti ##ters of neutral ##izing antibodies . this distinction was mediated by mouse ph ##ago ##cy ##tic cells ( mono ##cy ##te - derived in ##fi ##lt ##rating macro ##pha ##ges and partially al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges , but not ne ##ut ##rop ##hil ##s ) , as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by im ##mun ##ological de ##ple ##tion of selected cell types . these results indicate that the cooperation of anti - sar ##s - co ##v antibodies and ph ##ago ##cy ##tic cells plays an important role in the elimination of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract rec ##om ##bina ##nt fragments of s proteins from the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sara - co ##v ) were generated and used in a western b ##lot ( wb ) ass ##ay that was compared to a commercial sar ##s elisa method . in 85 % of confirmed sar ##s cases ( n = 20 ) , the s ##2 rec ##om ##bina ##nt fragment based wb was positive and this was comparable to the commercial elisa using heat killed sar ##s - co ##v . wb using the other four rec ##om ##bina ##nt fragments in confirmed sar ##s cases generated lower rates of detection ( s ##1 — 75 % , s ##1 - n — 25 % , s ##1 - c — 55 % ) . evaluation of sera from healthy controls ( n = 60 ) resulted in two weakly positive elisa results with the remainder being negative while the s ##2 protein wb demonstrated three positive results from the 20 controls with a history of sar ##s contact and no positive results in 40 non ##con ##ta ##ct controls . a disc ##re ##pan ##cy between the elisa and s ##2 wb arose when evaluating per - 2003 sera from individuals ( n = 10 ) with sar ##s - like symptoms ( elisa — 100 % positive , s ##2 wb — 30 % positive ) . these data suggest that the s ##2 wb ass ##ay may be particularly useful in elisa - negative sar ##s cases and in some elisa - positive non - sar ##s cases .  
abstract in this study , we have identified 87 ##6 poly ##morphism sites in 145 complete or partial genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##v available in the nc ##bi gen ##bank . one hundred and seventy - four of these sites existed in two or more sar ##s - co ##v genome sequences . according to the sequence poly ##morphism , all sar ##s - co ##vs can be divided into three groups : ( i ) group 1 , animal - origin viruses ( such as sar ##s - co ##v s ##z ##1 , s ##z ##3 , s ##z ##13 and s ##z ##16 ) ; ( ii ) group 2 , all viruses with clinical origin during first epidemic ; and ( iii ) group 3 , sar ##s - co ##v g ##d ##0 ##3 ##t ##00 ##13 . according to 10 special lo ##ci , group 2 again can be divided into gen ##otype ##s c and t , which can be further divided into sub - gen ##otype ##s c1 – c ##4 and t ##1 – t ##4 . positive darwin ##ian selections were identified between any pair of these three groups . gen ##otype c gives neutral selection . gen ##otype t , however , shows negative selection . by comparing the death rates of sar ##s patients in the different regions , it was found that the death rate caused by the viruses of the gen ##otype c was lower than that of the gen ##otype t . sar ##s - co ##vs might originate from an unknown ancestor .  
a recent study in this journal studied the genome ##s of the novel sar ##s - like corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) in china and suggested that the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 had undergone genetic rec ##om ##bina ##tion with sar ##s - related co ##v ##1 . by february 14 , 2020 , a total of 66 , 57 ##6 confirmed cases of co ##vid - 19 , people infected with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , were reported in china , leading to 1 , 52 ##4 deaths , per the chinese cdc ( http : / / 2019 ##nco ##v . china ##cd ##c . cn / 2019 - nc ##ov / ) . several full gen ##omic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics ##2 , 3 , 4 . here , we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation . the sequences of beta ##co ##v were downloaded on february 3 , 2020 from the gi ##sai ##d platform ##5 . a total of 58 accession ##s were available , among which beta ##co ##v / bat / yunnan / rat ##g ##13 / 2013 is a known close relative of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . four accession ##s , namely , beta ##co ##v / italy / in ##m ##1 / 2020 , beta ##co ##v / italy / in ##m ##2 / 2020 , beta ##co ##v / kan ##agawa / 1 / 2020 , and beta ##co ##v / usa / il ##1 / 2020 , were excluded because of the short - truncated sequences or multiple ambiguous nu ##cle ##otide ##s . a total of 54 accession ##s ( supplementary table 1 ) isolated from humans were utilized in the following analysis . the sequences nc _ 00 ##47 ##18 . 3 of sar ##s corona ##virus ##6 genes were utilized to define the protein products of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the protein sequences of or ##f ##1 ##ab , s , e , m , and n genes were translated , and all of the lo ##ci without experimental evidence ##s were excluded . first , the protein sequences of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 were compared with rat ##g ##13 , human sar ##s ( nc _ 00 ##47 ##18 . 3 ) , bat sar ##s ( dq ##0 ##22 ##30 ##5 . 2 ) , and human mer ##s ( nc _ 01 ##9 ##8 ##43 . 3 ) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window ( figure 1a ) . the sliding window was set to 500 for or ##f ##1 ##ab and s , and to 50 for proteins e , m , and n considering their short length . sar ##s - co ##v - 2
thus far , no human mer ##s - co ##v infections have been reported from israel . evidence for the circulation of mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies has been reported from almost all the countries of the middle east , except israel . therefore , we aimed to analyze mer ##s - co ##v infection in israeli camel ##ids , sampled between 2012 and 2017 . a total of 411 camel ##s , 102 al ##pac ##as and 19 ll ##ama ##s ' sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to mer ##s - co ##v . our findings indicate a lower mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity among israeli dr ##ome ##dar ##ies than in the surrounding countries , and for the first time naturally infected ll ##ama ##s were identified . in addition , nasal sw ##ab ##s of 66 ##1 camel ##s , al ##pac ##as and lama ##s , obtained from january 2015 to december 2017 , were tested for the presence of mer ##s - co ##v rna . all nasal sw ##ab ##s were negative , indicating no evidence for mer ##s - co ##v active circulation in these camel ##ids during that time period .  
background : middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) remains a major concern for global public health . dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are the source of human zoo ##not ##ic infection . mer ##s - co ##v is enzo ##otic among dr ##ome ##dar ##ies on the arabian peninsula , the middle east and in africa . over 70 % of infected dr ##ome ##dar ##ies are found in africa . however , all known zoo ##not ##ic cases of mer ##s have occurred in the arabian peninsula with none being reported in africa . aim : we aimed to investigate ser ##ological evidence of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans living in camel - herd ##ing areas in morocco to provide insights on whether zoo ##not ##ic transmission is taking place . methods : we carried out a cross sectional ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce study from november 2017 through january 2018 . we adapted a generic world health organization mer ##s - co ##v question ##naire and protocol to assess demographic and risk factors of infection among a presumed high - risk population . elisa , mer ##s - co ##v spike pseudo ##par ##tic ##le neutral ##isation tests ( pp ##nt ) and plaque neutral ##isation tests ( pr ##nt ) were used to assess mer ##s - co ##v ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity . results : serum samples were collected from camel slaughter ##house workers ( n = 137 ) , camel herd ##ers ( n = 156 ) and individuals of the general population without occupational contact with camel ##s but living in camel herd ##ing areas ( n = 186 ) . mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##ising antibodies with ≥ 90 % reduction of plaque numbers were detected in two ( 1 . 5 % ) slaughter ##house workers , none of the camel herd ##ers and one individual from the general population ( 0 . 5 % ) . conclusions : this study provides evidence of zoo ##not ##ic transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in morocco in people who have direct or indirect exposure to dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus was first identified in 2003 when it caused an epidemic of fatal human pneumonia cases that rapidly spread to multiple countries from an epic ##enter in hong kong . the outbreak was eventually controlled by qu ##aran ##tine measures but not before it had caused many fatalities . the original zoo ##not ##ic source of the sar ##s virus that caused the outbreak is still unknown but is suspected to be bats . attempts were made to develop a prop ##hyl ##actic vaccine but the sar ##s epidemic was over before any vaccines could be tested for human efficacy . as will be discussed in this chapter , corona ##virus vaccines present many challenges including low and rapidly wan ##ing immunity and the fact that corona ##virus vaccines , particularly when formulated with th ##2 - biased al ##um ad ##ju ##vant ##s , can ex ##ace ##rba ##te corona ##virus infection - associated e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic lung im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology . fortunately , this problem can be avoided by formulation of corona ##virus vaccines with th ##1 - type ad ##ju ##vant ##s that enhance t cell if ##n - γ responses , such as , delta in ##ulin or t ##lr ago ##nist ##s . hence , appropriate ad ##ju ##vant selection is vital ##ly important for the development of safe and effective corona ##virus vaccines . this chapter will describe the current state of development of sar ##s vaccines , the issue of corona ##virus - associated e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic lung im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology and how ad ##ju ##vant ##s can be used to reduce the risk of this com ##plication .  
abstract the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) was identified as a corona ##virus ( co ##v ) following the outbreak of 2002 – 2003 . there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for sar ##s - co ##v infections . potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models . the aged bal ##b / c mouse model for sar ##s supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimic ##s sar ##s in the elderly . we tested two prevent ##ive strategies , va ##cci ##nation and passive transfer of serum antibody , to determine the extent of protection achieved against sar ##s - co ##v challenge in this model . these approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody ti ##ters sufficient to reduce viral load , protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic changes in the lungs of aged mice . this study valid ##ates the utility of the aged bal ##b / c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and im ##mun ##op ##rop ##hyl ##ax ##is .  
since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) 18 years ago , a large number of sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##sr - co ##vs ) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host , bats ( 1 – 4 ) . previous studies have shown that some bat sar ##sr - co ##vs have the potential to in ##fect humans ( 5 – 7 ) . here we report the identification and characterization of a new corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in wu ##han , china . the epidemic , which started on 12 december 2019 , had caused 2 , 79 ##4 laboratory - confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 january 2020 . full - length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak . the sequences are almost identical and share 79 . 6 % sequence identity to sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , we show that 2019 - nc ##ov is 96 % identical at the whole - genome level to a bat corona ##virus . pair ##wise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non - structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of sar ##sr - co ##v . in addition , 2019 - nc ##ov virus isolated from the bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutral ##ized by sera from several patients . notably , we confirmed that 2019 - nc ##ov uses the same cell entry receptor — ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ii ( ace ##2 ) — as sar ##s - co ##v .  
summary since the initial description of the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in september 2012 , a total of 103 ##8 cases of mer ##s - co ##v including 460 deaths have been reported from saudi arabia . from august 24 , 2013 to september 3 , 2013 , a total of 39 ##7 patients and contacts were tested for mer ##s - co ##v . of those tested , there were 18 ( 4 . 5 % ) mer ##s - co ##v cases reported in al - mad ##ina ##h al - mu ##na ##w ##wara ##h with one large cluster . in this report , we describe the outcome , ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and clinical characteristics of this cluster of which 4 cases involved healthcare workers . fourteen cases appeared to be linked to one cluster involving healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) , family and patient contacts . of the 18 cases , five ( including 2 hc ##ws ) were community acquired , two were household contacts , and 11 were healthcare associated ( including 4 hc ##ws ) . all except 4 cases were sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic and the case fatal ##ity rate was 39 % ( 7 of 18 ) . the outbreak resulted in human to human transmission of an estimated 6 cases . contact screening showed positive test in 1 of 56 ( 1 . 8 % ) household contacts , and 3 of 250 ( 1 . 2 % ) hc ##ws .  
abstract the en ##zy ##matic activity of the sar ##s corona ##virus main protein ##ase dime ##r was characterized by a sensitive , quantitative ass ##ay . the new , flu ##oro ##genic substrate , ( ala - ar ##g - le ##u - g ##ln - nh ) 2 - r ##ho ##dam ##ine , contained a severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) main protein ##ase consensus cleavage sequence and r ##ho ##dam ##ine 110 , one of the most detect ##able compounds known , as the reporter group . the gene for the enzyme was clone ##d in the absence of purification tags , expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and the enzyme pu ##rified . enzyme activity from the sar ##s co ##v main protein ##ase dime ##r could readily be detected at low pm concentrations . the enzyme exhibited a high k m , and is unusually sensitive to ionic strength and reducing agents .  
summary effective counter ##me ##as ##ures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it . however , little information is available about the targets of immune responses to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . we used the immune ep ##ito ##pe database and analysis resource ( ie ##db ) to catalog available data related to other corona ##virus ##es . this includes sar ##s - co ##v , which has high sequence similarity to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and is the best - characterized corona ##virus in terms of ep ##ito ##pe responses . we identified multiple specific regions in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 that have high homo ##logy to the sar ##s - co ##v virus . parallel bio ##in ##form ##atic predictions identified a prior ##i potential b and t cell ep ##ito ##pes for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . these predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority .  
abstract background the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) has been reported for the first time in ##fect ##ing a human being since 2012 . the who was notified of 27 countries have reported cases of mer ##s , the majority of these cases occur in the arabian peninsula , particularly in saudi arabia . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are likely to be the main source of middle east respiratory syndrome virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in humans . methods mer ##s - co ##v infection rates among camel ##s in livestock markets and slaughter ##houses were investigated in saudi arabia . a total of 69 ##8 nasal sw ##ab ##s were collected and examined with rapid ass ##ay and rt ##rt - pc ##r . ten mer ##s - co ##v positive samples were subjected to full gen ##omic sequencing . in addition , the sensitivity and specific ##ity of the rapid im ##mun ##och ##rom ##ato ##graphic ass ##ay ( bio ##note , south korea ) was evaluated as a diagnostic tool for mer ##s - co ##v compared to rt ##rt - pc ##r . results the results showed a high percentage of dr ##ome ##dar ##ies ( 56 . 4 % ) had evidence for nasal mer ##s - co ##v infection . phylogenetic analysis of the ten mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s showed that the sequences were closely related to the other mer ##s - co ##v strains recovered from camel ##s and human cases . moreover , the results showed that 195 samples were positive for mer ##s - co ##v by rapid ass ##ay compared to 39 ##4 positive samples of rt ##rt - pc ##r , which showed low rapid ass ##ay sensitivity ( 49 . 49 % ) while , the specific ##ity were found to be 100 % . conclusion these findings indicate that these sites are a highly - hazardous to zoo ##not ##ic diseases .  
abstract ep ##ito ##pe - based vaccines designed to induce antibody responses specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) are being developed as a means for increasing vaccine pot ##ency . in this study , we identified four b cell ep ##ito ##pes from the spike ( s ) and membrane ( m ) protein through bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis and constructed a multi - ep ##ito ##pe dna vaccine . intra ##mus ##cular im ##mun ##ization of mice with this vaccine was sufficient to induce specific prime as well as a long - term memory humor ##al immune response to at least two candidate ep ##ito ##pes , s ##43 ##7 – 45 ##9 and m1 – 20 . a dna prime – protein boost strategy greatly enhanced the antibody generation and the immune sera not only reacted with the l ##ys ##ates of sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells but also neutral ##ized the cy ##top ##athic effect of sar ##s by 75 % at 1 : 160 dil ##ution . the novel im ##mun ##ogenic s protein peptide revealed in this study provides new target for sar ##s vaccine design ; and our work indicated multi - ep ##ito ##pe dna vaccine as an effective means for eli ##cit ##ing poly ##valent humor ##al immune response against sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic originating from china in 2002 was caused by a previously un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized corona ##virus that could be identified by specific rt - pc ##r amp ##li ##fication . efforts to control future sar ##s outbreak ##s depend on the accurate and early identification of sar ##s - co ##v infected patients . a real - time flu ##oro ##genic rt - pc ##r ass ##ay based on the 3 ′ - non ##co ##ding region ( 3 ′ - nc ##r ) of sar ##s - co ##v genome was developed as a quantitative sar ##s diagnostic tool . the ideal amp ##li ##fication efficiency of a sensitive sar ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r ass ##ay should yield an e value ( pc ##r product concentration increase per amp ##li ##fication cycle ) equal to 2 . 0 . it was demonstrated that the 3 ′ - nc ##r sar ##s - co ##v based rt - pc ##r reactions could be formulated to reach excellent e values of 1 . 81 , or 91 % amp ##li ##fication efficacy . the sar ##s - co ##v cd ##na preparations derived from viral rna extract and the clone ##d rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d both exhibit the identical amp ##li ##fication characteristics , i . e . amp ##li ##fication efficacy using the same pc ##r formulation developed in this study . the viral gen ##omic copy ( or gen ##omic equivalence ##s , ge ) per infectious unit ( ge / p ##fu ) of sar ##s - co ##v used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200 – 1600 : 1 . the ass ##ay ’ s detection sensitivity could reach 0 . 00 ##5 ##pf ##u or 6 – 8 ##ge per ass ##ay . it was pre ##lim ##ina ##rily demonstrated that the ass ##ay could efficiently detect sar ##s - co ##v from clinical specimens of sar ##s probable and suspected patients identified in taiwan . the 3 ′ - nc ##r based sar ##s - co ##v ass ##ay demonstrated 100 % diagnostic specific ##ity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non - sar ##s epidemic region .  
a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , emerged on the arabian peninsula in 2012 . mer ##s - co ##v was found to produce severe respiratory illness with case - fatal ##ity rates near 50 % , and may be transmitted person - to - person in instances of close physical contact , such as among family members and to health care workers . as mice , ham ##sters , fe ##rret ##s , and cy ##no ##mo ##l ##gus mac ##aq ##ues are either not susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v infection or do not develop ob ##ser ##vable clinical disease , we sought to determine whether r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues ( mac ##aca mu ##lat ##ta ) can be used as a model of mer ##s - co ##v infection and disease . animals challenged with mer ##s - co ##v via multiple combined infection routes rapidly developed pneumonia , and we observed other clinical signs of illness , virus shed ##ding , and virus replication in respiratory tissues . using micro ##ar ##ray ##s to compare transcript ##s associated with his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic lesions removed from the lungs of infected animals , we identified 173 significant differential ##ly expressed genes ( de ##g ) associated with lung lesions on day 3 post - infection concurrent with peak clinical signs . functional analysis indicated that these genes were predominantly associated with pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory processes , recruitment and che ##mot ##ax ##is of inflammatory cells , and anti ##vira ##l immunity . using singular value decomposition coupled multi ##dim ##ens ##ional scaling ( sv ##d - md ##s ) , we also identified changes in similar inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells , suggesting a rapid activation of innate immune and inflammatory processes in le ##uk ##ocytes after infection . these data were consistent with cy ##tok ##ine and che ##mo ##kin ##e profiles in the blood of animals . due to the urgent need for an effective therapeutic means of treating mer ##s - co ##v patients , we used this r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue model to evaluate post - exposure treatment with combination inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - a2 ##b and rib ##avi ##rin ( rb ##v ) , and identified key transcription ##al signatures associated with disease severity and treatment efficacy . animals treated with if ##n - a2 ##b / rb ##v beginning 8 ##h post - infection did not develop significant clinical or severe his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic signs of disease , breathing abnormalities , or radio ##graphic evidence of pneumonia , and showed reduced viral loads and lower levels of serum pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines . micro ##ar ##ray analysis of treated animals showed significant induction of inter ##fer ##on - stimulated genes ( is ##gs ) and fewer up ##re ##gul ##ated transcript ##s associated
first reported from wu ##han , the people ' s republic of china , on 31 december 2019 , the ongoing outbreak of a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 ‐ nc ##ov ) causes great global concerns . based on the advice of the international health regulations emergency committee and the fact that to date 24 other countries also reported cases , the who director ‐ general declared that the outbreak of 2019 ‐ nc ##ov constitutes a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 . together with the other two highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es , the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s ‐ co ##v ) , 2019 ‐ nc ##ov and other yet to be identified corona ##virus ##es pose a global threat to public health . in this mini ‐ review , we provide a brief introduction to the pathology and pathogen ##esis of sar ##s ‐ co ##v and mer ##s ‐ co ##v and extra ##pol ##ate this knowledge to the newly identified 2019 ‐ nc ##ov .

surveillance of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was conducted to explore the possible introduction and circulation of this novel virus in catalonia , northeastern spain . five hundred and sixty - three samples from mild and severe respiratory infections collected between january 2012 and april 2013 were screened using real - time rt - pc ##r . all samples were negative , suggesting that mer ##s - co ##v is not circulating silently in catalonia .  
we have read with great interest the correspondence by shi ##bo jiang and colleagues , 1 in which they propose a name change for the newly emerged corona ##virus , 2 which was recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) by the corona ##virus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses . 3 the authors argued that the use of sar ##s in the virus name could confuse the public about the disease that it causes ; in addition , they noted that the name sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is not consistent with the disease name chosen by who , corona ##virus disease 2019 . the authors also indicated that scientific ##ally , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is naturally occurring and different from other sar ##s - like or sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences . furthermore , given the probability of future at ##ten ##uation of this virus to a low - pathogen ##ic form , the authors predict that the use of the name sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might have adverse effects , both socially and economically . on these grounds , the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human corona ##virus 2019 ( hc ##ov - 19 ) . although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated , we feel that the adoption of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by the corona ##virus study group was appropriate . to facilitate good practice and scientific exchange , the international committee on taxonomy of viruses has established standard ##ised formats for classify ##ing viruses . under these rules , a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on ph ##yl ##ogen ##y and taxonomy . 4 through diversity partition ##ing by hierarchical cluster ##ing - based analyses , 5 the newly emerged corona ##virus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to sar ##s - co ##v , the primary viral isolate defining the species . the sar ##s - co ##v species includes viruses such as sar ##s - co ##v , sar ##s - co ##v _ pc ##4 - 227 , and sar ##sr - co ##v - bt ##ky ##7 ##2 . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the newest member of this viral species . the use of sar ##s in naming sar ##s - co ##v - 2 does not derive from the name of the sar ##s disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the sar ##s species . the use of sar ##s for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species , sar ##s - co ##v . in other words , viruses in this species can be named sar ##s regardless of whether or not they cause sar
abstract after deco ##ding the genome of sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , next challenge is to understand how this virus causes the illness at molecular bases . of the viral structural proteins , the n protein plays a pi ##vot role in assembly process of viral particles as well as viral replication and transcription . the sar ##s - co ##v n proteins expressed in the eu ##kar ##yo ##tes , such as yeast and he ##k ##29 ##3 cells , appeared in the multiple spots on two - dimensional electro ##ph ##ores ##is ( 2d ##e ) , whereas the proteins expressed in e . coli showed a single 2d ##e spot . these 2d ##e spots were further examined by western b ##lot and mal ##di - to ##f / to ##f ms , and identified as the n proteins with differently apparent pi values and similar molecular mass of 50 ##k ##da . in the light of the observations and other evidence ##s , a hypothesis was post ##ulated that the sar ##s - co ##v n protein could be ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in eu ##kar ##yo ##tes . to locate the plausible regions of ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation in the n protein , two truncated n proteins were generated in e . coli and treated with p ##k ##c ##α . the two truncated n proteins after inc ##uba ##tion of p ##k ##c ##α exhibited the differently electro ##ph ##ore ##tic behaviors on 2d ##e , suggesting that the region of 1 – 256 aa in the n protein was the possible target for p ##k ##c ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation . moreover , the sar ##s - co ##v n protein expressed in yeast were partially digest ##ed with try ##ps ##in and carefully analyzed by mal ##di - to ##f / to ##f ms . in contrast to the completely try ##ptic digest ##ion , these partially digest ##ed fragments generated two new peptide mass signals with neutral loss , and ms / ms analysis revealed two ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated peptide ##s located at the “ dense ser ##ine ” island in the n protein with amino acid sequences , g ##fy ##ae ##gs ##rg ##gs ##qa ##ss ##rs ##ss ##r and g ##ns ##gn ##st ##pg ##ss ##rg ##ns ##par ##mas ##gg ##g ##k . with the p ##k ##c ##α ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation treatment and the partially try ##ptic digest ##ion , the n protein expressed in e . coli released the same peptide ##s as observed in yeast cells . thus , this investigation provided the preliminary data to determine the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation sites in the sar ##s - co ##v n protein , and partially clarified the argument regarding the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation possibility of the n protein during the infection process of sar ##s - co ##v to human host .  
abstract ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) is the receptor that severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) utilizes for target cell entry and , therefore , plays an important role in sar ##s pathogen ##esis . since chinese r ##hes ##us ( r ##h ) mac ##aq ##ues do not usually develop sar ##s after sar ##s - co ##v infection , it has been suggested that r ##h - ace ##2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently . to determine the role of r ##h - ace ##2 in early lung pathogen ##esis in vivo , we studied eleven chinese r ##hes ##us monkeys experimental ##ly infected with a pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v ##pu ##mc ##01 strain . r ##h - ace ##2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction , and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudo ##virus entry ass ##ay . many natural non - synonymous ( ns ) changes were found in r ##h - ace ##2 genes . compared to human ( hu ) ace ##2 , thirty - eight consensus ns changes were found in r ##h - ace ##2 . since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of sar ##s - co ##v , r ##h - ace ##2 in general is as effective as human homo ##log in supporting viral entry . r ##h - ace ##2 , however , is more poly ##morphic than hu - ace ##2 . additional sporadic ns substitution ##s in clone r ##h ##11 - 7 reduced the level of r ##h - ace ##2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively . further mu ##tage ##nes ##is analysis showed that a natural mutation y ##21 ##7 ##n dramatically alter ##s ace ##2 expression and entry efficiency . moreover , introduction of the y ##21 ##7 ##n mutation into hu - ace ##2 caused the down - regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency . these results indicate that the y ##21 ##7 ##n mutation plays a role in mod ##ulating sar ##s - co ##v infection . our results provide insights for understanding the role of r ##h - ace ##2 in sar ##s lung pathogen ##esis in a non - human primate model .  
abstract hospitalized children < 2 years of age in amman , jordan , admitted for fever and / or respiratory symptoms , were tested for middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) : mer ##s - co ##v by real - time rt - pc ##r ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) . this was a prospective year - round viral surveillance study in children < 2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and / or fever from march 2010 to september 2012 and enrolled from a government - run hospital , al - bash ##ir in amman , jordan . clinical and demographic data , including anti ##biotic use , were collected . combined nasal / throat sw ##ab ##s were collected , ali ##qu ##oted , and frozen at – 80 ##° ##c . specimen ali ##qu ##ots were shipped to vanderbilt university and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , and tested by rr ##t - pc ##r for mer ##s - co ##v . of the 243 ##3 subjects enrolled from 16 march 2010 to 10 september 2012 , 242 ##7 subjects had viral testing and clinical data . of 1898 specimens prospective ##ly tested for other viruses between 16 march 2010 and 18 march 2012 , 47 ##4 samples did not have other common respiratory viruses detected . these samples were tested at cdc for mer ##s - co ##v and all were negative by rr ##t - pc ##r for mer ##s - co ##v . of the remaining 53 ##1 samples , collected from 19 march 2012 to 10 september 2012 and tested at vanderbilt , none were positive for mer ##s - co ##v . our negative findings from a large sample of young jordanian children hospitalized with fever and / or respiratory symptoms suggest that mer ##s - co ##v was not widely circulating in amman , jordan , during the 30 - month period of prospective , active surveillance occurring before and after the first documented mer ##s - co ##v outbreak in the middle east region .  
abstract during the 2015 korean mer ##s outbreak , we experienced at ##yp ##ical presentations of mer ##s - co ##v infections in three im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised hosts that warrant ##ed exceptional management . case 1 showed delayed sy ##mpt ##om development after a four - day as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic period , case 2 experienced a 20 - day inc ##uba ##tion period , and case 3 exhibited persistent viral shed ##ding without clinical deterioration . recognizing these exceptions is extremely important in the management of mer ##s - co ##v - exposed or - infected patients and for control of potential mer ##s outbreak ##s .  
summary in june 2003 , taiwan introduced a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) telephone hot ##line service to provide concerned caller ##s with rapid access to information , advice and appropriate refer ##ral where necessary . this paper reports an evaluation of the knowledge , attitude , practices and sources of information relating to sar ##s among physicians who staffed the sar ##s fever hot ##line service . a retrospective survey was conducted using a self - administered postal question ##naire . participants were physicians who staffed a sar ##s hot ##line during the sar ##s epidemic in taipei , taiwan from june 1 to 10 , 2003 . a response rate of 83 % was obtained . all respondents knew the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s , and knowledge regarding sar ##s features and prevent ##ive practices was good . however , only 54 % of respondents knew the inc ##uba ##tion period of sar ##s . hospital guidelines and news media were the major information sources . in responding to two case scenarios most physicians were likely to tri ##age caller ##s at high risk of sar ##s appropriately , but not caller ##s at low risk . less than half of all respondents answered both scenarios correctly . the results obtained suggest that knowledge of sar ##s was generally good although obtained from both medical and non - medical sources . specific knowledge was however lacking in certain areas and this affected the ability to appropriately tri ##age caller ##s . standardized education and assessment of prior knowledge of sar ##s could improve the ability of physicians to tri ##age caller ##s in future outbreak ##s .  
abstract the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of a corona ##virus plays a crucial role in virus assembly and in its rna transcription . it is important to character ##ize a virus at the nu ##cle ##otide level to discover the virus ’ s gen ##omic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins . this en ##tails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genome ##s of interest for preferred nu ##cle ##otide ##s , cod ##on bias , nu ##cle ##otide changes at the 3rd position ( nt ##3 ##s ) , synonymous cod ##on usage and relative synonymous cod ##on usage . in this study , the variations in the n proteins among 13 different corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) were anal ##yse ##d at the nu ##cle ##otide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred cod ##on usage in the n genes . the results revealed that , overall , eighteen amino acids had different preferred cod ##ons and eight of these were over - biased . the n genes had a higher at % over g ##c % and the values of their effective number of cod ##ons ranged from 40 . 43 to 53 . 85 , indicating a slight cod ##on bias . neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of g ##c ##3 ##s / g ##c correlation in por ##cine epidemic dia ##rr ##hea co ##v ( pe ##dc ##ov ) , followed by middle east respiratory syndrome - co ##v ( mer ##s co ##v ) , por ##cine delta co ##v ( dc ##ov ) , bat co ##v ( bc ##ov ) and fe ##line co ##v ( fc ##ov ) with r values 0 . 81 , 0 . 68 , - 0 . 47 , 0 . 98 and 0 . 58 , respectively . these data implied a high rate of evolution of the co ##v genome ##s and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the co ##v n genes . this type of genetic analysis would be useful for evaluating a virus ’ s host adaptation , evolution and is thus of value to vaccine design strategies .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are enveloped , positive - strand rna viruses with characteristic spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s that project outward like the rays of the sun ( corona – latin for ‘ crown ’ ) , when visual ##ized by electron microscopy . co ##v are classified , together with the toro ##virus ##es , in the family corona ##vir ##idae and the order ni ##do ##vira ##les . all ni ##do ##virus ##es have a common genome organization and generate a nest ##ed set ( ni ##do – latin for ‘ nest ’ ) of 3 ′ co - terminal mrna ##s . co ##vs have been isolated from a variety of species , including birds , livestock , domestic animals , and humans . co ##v infections can cause respiratory , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal , and ne ##uro ##logic disease , depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection . importantly , co ##vs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to in ##fect humans and cause severe disease . the co ##v responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in 2002 – 03 likely originated as a bat corona ##virus which , during replication in an intermediate host ( such as the palm ci ##vet ) , evolved to be able to in ##fect humans efficiently . sar ##s - co ##v infected over 800 ##0 people with approximately 10 % mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts . middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , first reported in 2012 , is likely transmitted from camel ##s to humans with potentially fatal consequences . to date , there are no approved vaccines or direct acting anti ##vira ##l drugs to combat corona ##virus infections in humans . the emergence or re - emergence of co ##vs from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health .  
abstract background : sar ##s corona ##virus has been identified as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . few tests allow confirmation or exclusion of sar ##s within the first few days of infection . a gene chip is a useful tool for the study of micro ##bial infections mainly for its capability of performing multi - target analysis in a single test . objectives : investigate the possibility of early detection of sar ##s virus from clinical samples using the gene chip - based method . study design : we pu ##rified rna from sar ##s - co ##v obtained from routinely collected peripheral blood and sp ##ut ##um samples of 34 patients who had been identified as probable sar ##s patients by following the interim u . s . case definition . four segments of the sar ##s - co ##v were amplified using reverse transcription - nest ##ed pc ##r and the products examined using the 70 - mer gene chips for sar ##s - co ##v detection . results : a blind - test of both peripheral blood and sp ##ut ##um specimens lead to the positive detection of sar ##s - co ##v in 31 out of 34 patients . sar ##s - co ##v was not found in peripheral blood or sp ##ut ##um specimens from three patients . two of the 34 patients were only 3 days post - onset of symptoms and were subsequently confirmed to be sar ##s positive . our results indicate that the gene chip - based molecular test is specific for sar ##s - co ##v and allows early detection of patients with sar ##s with detection rate about 8 % higher than the single pc ##r test when the sp ##ut ##um sample is available .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s disease , which has ever severely menace ##d humans from the end of 2002 to june 2003 . to date , great efforts have been made for the discovery of therapeutic compounds by using various technologies . in this report , we present a survey of these techniques and their applications in the development of promising anti - sar ##s agents . section editors : li - he zhang – school of pharmaceutical science , peking university , beijing , china kai ##xia ##n chen – shanghai institute of mater ##ia med ##ica , chinese academy of sciences , shanghai , china 
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been globally reported . a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , sar ##s - co ##v , was identified as the et ##iol ##ogical agent of the disease . sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) media ##tes the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic processing of replica ##se poly ##pe ##pt ##ides 1a and 1a ##b into functional proteins , playing an important role in viral replication . in this study , we demonstrated the expression of the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and ve ##ro cells , and then characterized the in vitro trans - cleavage and the cell - based cis - cleavage by the 3 ##cl ##pro . mutation ##al analysis of the 3 ##cl ##pro demonstrated the importance of his ##41 , cy ##s ##14 ##5 , and g ##lu ##16 ##6 in the substrate - binding sub ##sit ##e s ##1 for keeping the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity . in addition , alan ##ine substitution of the cleavage substrates indicated that g ##ln - p ##1 in the substrates mainly determined the cleavage efficiency . therefore , this study not only established the quan ##ti ##fia ##ble and reliable ass ##ay for the in vitro and cell - based measurement of the 3 ##cl ##pro activity , but also characterized the molecular interaction of the sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro with the substrates . the results will be useful for the rational development of the anti - sar ##s drugs .  
the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) poses a potential threat to global public health . many aspects of the evolution and transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in its animal reservoir remain unclear . a recent study provides new insights into the evolution and transmission of mer ##s - co ##v in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s .  
both corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) are characterised by an over ##ex ##uber ##ant inflammatory response and , for sar ##s , viral load is not correlated with the worse ##ning of symptoms . in our previous correspondence to the lance ##t , we described how benevolent ##ai ' s proprietary artificial intelligence ( ai ) - derived knowledge graph , que ##ried by a suite of algorithms , enabled identification of a target and a potential therapeutic against sar ##s corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ; the ca ##usa ##tive organism in co ##vid - 19 ) . we identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit cl ##ath ##rin - mediated end ##oc ##yt ##osis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells ( appendix ) . the drug targets are members of the numb - associated kinase ( nak ) family — including aa ##k ##1 and ga ##k — the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro . bari ##cit ##ini ##b was identified as a nak inhibitor , with a particularly high affinity for aa ##k ##1 , a pivotal regulator of cl ##ath ##rin - mediated end ##oc ##yt ##osis . we suggested that this drug could be of use in counter ##ing sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , subject to appropriate clinical testing .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es may cause respiratory , enter ##ic and central nervous system diseases in many species , including humans . until recently , the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses hampered development of corona ##virus specific therapeutic ##s . however , the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has prompted the discovery of such drugs . subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated the efficacy of sar ##s - co ##v specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies , peg ##yla ##ted - inter ##fer ##on - α and sir ##nas against sar ##s - co ##v . furthermore , several anti ##vira ##ls shown to be effective against other viruses were tested in vitro . because of availability and shown efficacy , the use of inter ##fer ##ons may be considered should sar ##s - co ##v or a related corona ##virus ( re ) - emerge . the more recent design of wide - spectrum inhibitors targeting the corona ##virus main pro ##tea ##ses may lead to the discovery of new anti ##vira ##ls against multiple corona ##virus induced diseases .  
abstract over 12 years have el ##ap ##sed since severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) triggered the first global alert for corona ##virus infections . virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) have not been observed since . however , other corona ##virus ##es still pose a continuous threat to human health , as exemplified by the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) in humans . the work on sar ##s - co ##v widen ##s our knowledge on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy and im ##mun ##ology of corona ##virus ##es and may shed light on mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . it has been confirmed that t - cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from sar ##s - co ##v infection . here ##in , we sum ##mar ##ize t - cell im ##mun ##ological studies of sar ##s - co ##v and discuss the potential cross - react ##ivity of the sar ##s - co ##v - specific immunity against mer ##s - co ##v , which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad - spectrum vaccines against corona ##virus infections .  
abstract currently , there is no registered treatment for infections with emerging zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es like sar ##s - and mer ##s - corona ##virus . we here report that in culture ##d cells low - micro ##mo ##lar concentrations of ali ##sp ##ori ##vir , a non - im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a - analog , inhibit the replication of four different corona ##virus ##es , including mer ##s - and sar ##s - corona ##virus . rib ##avi ##rin was found to further potent ##iate the anti ##vira ##l effect of ali ##sp ##ori ##vir in these cell culture - based infection models , but this combination treatment was unable to improve the outcome of sar ##s - co ##v infection in a mouse model . nevertheless , our data provide a basis to further explore the potential of cy ##p inhibitors as host - directed , broad - spectrum inhibitors of corona ##virus replication .  
in december 2019 , health authorities in wu ##han , china , identified a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown ae ##ti ##ology linked to the city ' s south china seafood market . subsequent investigations revealed a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , as the ca ##usa ##tive agent now at the heart of a major outbreak . the rising case numbers have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action , including the wholesale isolation of wu ##han . alongside this has been a robust scientific response , including early publication of the pathogen genome , and rapid development of highly specific diagnostic ##s . this article will review the new knowledge of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 co ##vid - 19 acute respiratory disease , and sum ##mar ##ise its clinical features .  
abstract the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 had caused a high rate of mortality . main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important target to discover pharmaceutical compounds for the therapy of this life - threatening disease . during the course of screening new anti - sar ##s agents , we have identified that a series of un ##sy ##mme ##tric ##al aromatic di ##sul ##fide ##s inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro significantly for the first time . here ##in , 40 novel un ##sy ##mme ##tric ##al aromatic di ##sul ##fide ##s were synthesized chemical ##ly and their biological activities were evaluated in vitro against sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro . these novel compounds displayed excellent ic 50 data in the range of 0 . 51 ##6 – 5 . 95 ##4 μ ##m . preliminary studies indicated that these di ##sul ##fide ##s are rev ##ers ##ible and mp ##eti ##tive inhibitors . a possible binding mode was generated via molecular docking simulation and a comparative field analysis ( com ##fa ) model was constructed to understand the structure - activity relationships . the present research therefore has provided some meaningful guidance to design and identify anti - sar ##s drugs with totally new chemical structures .  
abstract aim of the study severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a life - threatening disease caused by the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the development of new anti ##vira ##l agents for sar ##s - co ##v is an important issue . we tried to find potential resource from traditional chinese medicine ( tc ##m ) for development of new drugs against sar ##s - co ##v . materials and methods our team recruited the potential tc ##m formula ##e ( also known as kam ##po ) from two tc ##m books , shang - han lu ##n ( discussion of cold - induced disorders ) and wen - bing tia ##u - bei ##n ( differential management of feb ##ril ##e diseases ) . several herbs , which were believed to be beneficial for sar ##s by experienced tc ##m doctors were also recruited . in addition , a vegetable pol ##ular in taiwan , china and malaysia , the tender leaf of too ##na sin ##ensis roe ##m ( also known as ce ##dre ##la sin ##ensis , belongs to the family mel ##iac ##ceae ) was also recruited under the suggestion of botanic experts . these tc ##m products and plant extra ##ts were then tested for the effectiveness against sar ##s - co ##v in vitro . results only ts ##l - 1 , the extract from tender leaf of too ##na sin ##ensis roe ##m was found to have an evident effect against sar ##s - co ##v with select ##ivity index [UNK] . conclusion this paper reports for the first time that extract from a vegetable , the tender leaf of too ##na sin ##ensis roe ##m , can inhibit sar ##s - co ##v in vitro . there ##rf ##ore , the tender leaf of too ##na sin ##ensis roe ##m may be an important resource ag ##nin ##st sar ##s - co ##v .  
summary the last century has witnessed the emergence of several previously unknown viruses as life - threatening human pathogen ##s . several examples include hiv , e ##bola , lu ##jo , and , most recently , the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) and e ##bola . in this study , we describe a method for the swift generation of a human - derived mono ##cl ##onal antibody , known as lc ##a ##60 , as a treatment for mer ##s infections . lc ##a ##60 antibody was generated using the cell ##cl ##one technology from the immortal ##ized b cells of a human donor recovering from mer ##s . only four months were required from the initial screening of b cells to the development of a stable cho cell line suitable for the production of clinical grade antibody , thereby del ##ine ##ating a rapid pathway for the development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies against emerging viruses . currently , the lc ##a ##60 antibody is being considered for clinical development , which includes prop ##hyl ##ax ##is in individuals at risk and a treatment for severe mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract an important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic in 2003 to dia ##gno ##se and prevent virus spreading . several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses , subunit vaccines , virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) , dna vaccines , het ##ero ##log ##ous expression systems , and vaccines derived from sar ##s - co ##v genome by reverse genetics . this review describes several aspects essential to develop sar ##s - co ##v vaccines , such as the co ##rre ##lates of protection , virus ser ##otype ##s , va ##cci ##nation side effects , and bio - safeguard ##s that can be engineered into rec ##om ##bina ##nt vaccine approaches based on the sar ##s - co ##v genome . the production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent sar ##s has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates , in contrast to the design of vaccines for other corona ##virus ##es , that in general has been less successful . after pre ##cl ##ini ##cal trials in animal models , efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one third of human patients . in recent years , several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prop ##hyl ##ax ##is in prospective human epidemic ##s . in the current study , eight human mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) with neutral ##izing and non - neutral ##izing capabilities , directed against different ep ##ito ##pes of the mer ##s - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) spike ( mer ##s - s ) protein , were investigated with regard to their ability to im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical ##ly detect respective ep ##ito ##pes on formal ##in - fixed para ##ffin - embedded ( ff ##pe ) nasal tissue sections of mer ##s - co ##v experimental ##ly infected al ##pac ##as . the most intense im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ion was detected using a neutral ##izing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain s ##1 ##b of the mer ##s - s protein , which produced an im ##mun ##osi ##gna ##l in the cy ##top ##las ##m of ci ##lia ##ted respiratory ep ##ith ##eli ##um and along the apical me ##mb ##rano ##us region . a similar stain ##ing was obtained by two other mab ##s which recognize the si ##alic acid - binding domain and the ec ##to ##dom ##ain of the membrane fusion subunit s ##2 , respectively . five mab ##s lacked im ##mun ##ore ##act ##ivity for mer ##s - co ##v antigen on ff ##pe tissue , even though they belong , at least in part , to the same ep ##ito ##pe group . in summary , three tested human mab ##s demonstrated capacity for detection of mer ##s - co ##v antigen on ff ##pe samples and may be implemented in double or triple im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical methods .

abstract the main protein ##ase of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays an important role in viral transcription and replication , and is an attractive target for anti - sar ##s drug development . the important thing is to understand its binding mechanism with possible ligand ##s . in this study , we investigated possible non ##cano ##nical interactions , potential inhibitors , and binding pockets in the main protein ##ase of sar ##s - co ##v based on its recently determined crystal structure . these findings provide a wide clue to searching for anti - sar ##s drug . interesting ##ly , we found that similar structure patterns exist in sar ##s - co ##v main protein ##ase with pol ##io ##virus 3 ##c protein ##ase , rhino ##virus 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se , ns ##p ##4 protein ##ase from e ##quin ##e arte ##rit ##is virus , hepatitis c virus ns ##3 pro ##tea ##se , hepatitis a virus 3 ##c pro ##tea ##se , and deng ##ue virus ns ##3 pro ##tea ##se . it suggests that the available drugs in these viruses could be used to fight sar ##s disease .

abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in southern china in late 2002 and caused a global outbreak with a fatal ##ity rate around 10 % in 2003 . ten years later , a second highly pathogen ##ic human co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v , emerged in the middle east and has spread to other countries in europe , north africa , north america and asia . as of november 2017 , mer ##s - co ##v had infected at least 210 ##2 people with a fatal ##ity rate of about 35 % globally , and hence there is an urgent need to identify anti ##vira ##l drugs that are active against mer ##s - co ##v . here we show that a clinical ##ly available alcohol - ave ##rs ##ive drug , di ##sul ##fi ##ram , can inhibit the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##ses ( pl ##pro ##s ) of mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v . our findings suggest that di ##sul ##fi ##ram acts as an all ##ost ##eric inhibitor of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro but as a competitive ( or mixed ) inhibitor of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro . the phenomenon of slow - binding inhibition and the ir ##re ##co ##vera ##bility of enzyme activity after removing un ##bound di ##sul ##fi ##ram indicate co ##valent ina ##ct ##ivation of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro by di ##sul ##fi ##ram , while syn ##er ##gist ##ic inhibition of mer ##s - co ##v pl ##pro by di ##sul ##fi ##ram and 6 - th ##io ##gua ##nine or my ##co ##ph ##eno ##lic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinical ##ly available drugs .  
abstract we report on ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , a 4 - amino - qui ##no ##line , as an effective inhibitor of the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in vitro . ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e is a clinical ##ly approved drug effective against malaria . we tested ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e phosphate for its anti ##vira ##l potential against sar ##s - co ##v - induced cy ##top ##athic ##ity in ve ##ro e ##6 cell culture . results indicate that the ic ##50 of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e for anti ##vira ##l activity ( 8 . 8 ##± ##1 . 2 ##μ ##m ) was significantly lower than its cy ##tos ##tat ##ic activity ; cc ##50 ( 261 . 3 ##± ##14 . 5 ##μ ##m ) , yielding a select ##ivity index of 30 . the ic ##50 of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e for inhibition of sar ##s - co ##v in vitro approximate ##s the plasma concentrations of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e reached during treatment of acute malaria . addition of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e to infected cultures could be delayed for up to 5 ##h post ##in ##fect ##ion , without an important drop in anti ##vira ##l activity . ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e , an old anti ##mal ##aria ##l drug , may be considered for immediate use in the prevention and treatment of sar ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has boosted research on innate immune responses to corona ##virus ##es . it is now well established that the ca ##usa ##tive agent , a newly identified corona ##virus termed sar ##s - co ##v , employs multiple passive and active mechanisms to avoid induction of the anti ##vira ##l type i inter ##fer ##ons in tissue cells . by contrast , che ##mo ##kin ##es such as ip - 10 or il - 8 are strongly up ##re ##gul ##ated . the im ##balance in the if ##n response is thought to contribute to the establishment of vi ##rem ##ia early in infection , whereas the production of che ##mo ##kin ##es by infected organs may be responsible for ( i ) massive immune cell in ##filtration ##s found in the lungs of sar ##s victims , and ( ii ) the d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation of adaptive immunity . here , we will review the most recent findings on the interaction of sar ##s - co ##v and related corona ##vir ##idae members with the type i inter ##fer ##on and cy ##tok ##ine responses and discuss implications for pathogen ##esis and therapy .  
while severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is increasing in prevalence throughout the world , there had not been a documented case of sar ##s in pregnancy until early 2003 , when a pregnant woman infected with sar ##s sought care at this new jersey hospital in march 2003 . as this patient was the only known pregnant sar ##s patient in the u . s . , there was a critical need to balance patient privacy , confidential ##ity , general care needs and support with a worldwide need for knowledge about the outcomes from sar ##s infections . here ' s how the hospital staff worked with all of the agencies to develop protocols and coordinate this mother ' s and infant ' s care .  
abstract cho ##les ##terol present in the plasma membrane of target cells has been shown to be important for the infection by sar ##s - co ##v . we show that cho ##les ##terol de ##ple ##tion by treatment with methyl - β - cy ##cl ##ode ##xt ##rin ( m ##β ##cd ) affects infection by sar ##s - co ##v to the same extent as infection by ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus - based pseudo ##type ##s containing the surface g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein s of sar ##s - co ##v ( vs ##v - δ ##g - s ) . therefore , the role of cho ##les ##terol for sar ##s - co ##v infection can be assigned to the s protein and is unaffected by other corona ##virus proteins . there have been contradictory reports whether or not ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the cellular receptor for sar ##s - co ##v , is present in deter ##gent - resistant membrane domains . we found that ace ##2 of both ve ##ro e ##6 and ca ##co - 2 cells co - pu ##ri ##fies with marker proteins of deter ##gent - resistant membranes supporting the notion that cho ##les ##terol - rich micro ##dom ##ains provide a platform facilitating the efficient interaction of the s protein with the cellular receptor ace ##2 . to understand the involvement of cho ##les ##terol in the initial steps of the viral life cycle , we applied a cell - based binding ass ##ay with cells expressing the s protein and cells containing ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . alternatively , we used a soluble s protein as interaction partner . de ##ple ##tion of cho ##les ##terol from the ace ##2 - expressing cells reduced the binding of s - expressing cells by 50 % whereas the binding of soluble s protein was not affected . this result suggests that optimal infection requires a multi ##valent interaction between viral attachment protein and cellular receptors .  
abstract entry of sar ##s - co ##v into a target cell is initiated by binding of the s ##1 domain of spike protein to a receptor , followed by conform ##ation ##al changes of the spike protein s ##2 domain , resulting in the formation of a six - helix bundle by the he ##pta ##d - repeat ( hr ##1 and hr ##2 ) regions . our previous studies have demonstrated that peptide ##s derived from hr ##2 region could inhibit sar ##s - co ##v entry . however , synthesis of these peptide ##s is at high cost . in this study , we designed two rec ##om ##bina ##nt proteins , one containing two hr ##1 and one hr ##2 peptide ##s ( denoted hr ##12 ##1 ) , and the other consisting of two hr ##2 and one hr ##1 peptide ##s ( designated hr ##21 ##2 ) . these two proteins could be easily pu ##rified with the low cost of production , exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitor ##y activity on entry of the hiv / sar ##s pseudo ##virus ##es with ic ##50 values of 4 . 13 and 0 . 95 ##μ ##m , respectively . these features suggest that hr ##12 ##1 and hr ##21 ##2 can serve as potent inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v entry .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute respiratory illness , which has broken out in china . it has been known that sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s _ co ##v ) is a novel human corona ##virus and is responsible for sar ##s infection . belonging to one of the major proteins associated with sar ##s _ co ##v , sar ##s 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( sar ##s _ 3 ##cl ##pro ) functions as a cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##se engaging in the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic cleavage of the viral precursor poly ##pro ##tein to a series of functional proteins required for corona ##virus replication and is considered as an appealing target for designing anti - sar ##s agents . to facilitate the studies regarding the functions and structures of sar ##s _ 3 ##cl ##pro , in this report the synthetic genes encoding 3 ##cl ##pro of sar ##s _ co ##v were assembled , and the pl ##as ##mi ##d was constructed using p ##q ##e ##30 as vector and expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli m1 ##5 cells . the highly yielded ( [UNK] / l ) expressed pro ##tea ##se was pu ##rified by use of nt ##a - ni ##2 + affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy and f ##pl ##c system , and its sequence was determined by lc / ms with the residue coverage of 46 . 4 % .  
mer ##s - co ##v infection is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate . the exact incidence and prevalence of the disease is not known as we do not have yet reliable ser ##olo ##gic tests . the diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infection relies on detection of the virus using real - time rt - pc ##r . currently , the origin of the virus and the source is not known and future studies are needed to el ##uc ##ida ##te possible sources and the best therapeutic options .  
background the hallmark of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) disease is the ability to cause major health care - associated nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s with super ##sp ##rea ##ding events leading to massive numbers of cases and excessive mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . in this report , we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hem ##od ##ial ##ysis and became a mer ##s - co ##v super ##sp ##rea ##der , ign ##iting a recent multi ##hos ##pit ##al outbreak in ri ##yad ##h . material and results between may 31 and june 15 , 2017 , 44 cases of mer ##s - co ##v infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia , including 11 fatal cases . out of the total reported cases , 29 cases were reported from king sa ##ud medical city . the cluster at king sa ##ud medical city was ignited by a single super ##sp ##rea ##der patient who presented with acute renal failure . after 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hem ##od ##ial ##ysis sessions he was diagnosed with mer ##s - co ##v . one hundred twenty contacts who had direct un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure were screened . among those contacts , 9 out of 107 health care workers ( 5 nurses , 3 physicians , and 1 para ##med ##ic ) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v . conclusions this hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in dia ##gno ##sing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure , which leads to delayed suspicion of mer ##s - co ##v and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures . in mer ##s - co ##v endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point - of - care testing that would assist emergency department staff in tri ##aging suspected cases of mer ##s - co ##v to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major mer ##s - co ##v outbreak ##s .  
abstract gulf cooperation council ( g ##cc ) countries bear the heaviest br ##unt of mer ##s - co ##v . this study aims to compare public awareness and practice around mer ##s - co ##v across g ##cc countries . a cross - sectional survey was conducted using the gulf indicators ( gi ) smartphone app among people in the six g ##cc countries , namely saudi arabia , kuwait , the united arab emirates , qatar , bahrain , and oman . a total of 1812 participants recruited . all were aware of mer ##s - co ##v , yet the perception and practice around mer ##s - co ##v varied widely between countries . over two thirds were either “ not concerned ” or “ slightly concerned ” about contracting mer ##s - co ##v ; believing that they were under allah ’ s ( god ’ s ) protection ( 40 % ) was the most cited reason . while 79 % were aware that the disease can transmit through drop ##let from infected person , only 12 % stated that mer ##s - co ##v transmit ##s via camel ##s ; people in saudi arabia were better aware of the transmission . nevertheless , only 22 % of respondents believed that camel ##s are the zoo ##not ##ic reservoir of mer ##s - co ##v . those who were concerned about contracting mer ##s - co ##v ( ao ##r : 1 . 6 , 95 % ci : 1 . 2 – 2 . 1 , p < 0 . 01 ) and those who thought mer ##s - co ##v to be a severe disease only for those with high - risk conditions ( ao ##r : 1 . 5 , 95 % ci : 1 . 1 – 2 . 1 , p < 0 . 01 ) were more likely to believe that camel ##s are the zoo ##not ##ic source . however , residents of ks ##a ( ao ##r : 0 . 03 , 95 % ci : 0 . 01 – 0 . 07 , p < 0 . 01 ) , uae ( ao ##r : 0 . 01 , 95 % ci : 0 . 00 ##4 – 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 01 ) and kuwait ( ao ##r : 0 . 03 , 95 % ci : 0 . 01 – 0 . 07 , p < 0 . 01 ) were less likely to believe that camel ##s are the main zoo ##not ##ic source compared to respondents from the other countries . h ##y ##gie ##nic measures were more commonly adopted than avoidance of camel ##s or their raw products , yet there was a disc ##re ##pan ##cy between the countries . this study highlights that despite being aware of the ongoing mer ##s - co ##v epidemic ; many people lack accurate understanding about mer ##s - co ##v transmission , prevention , and are not fully compliant
abstract cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continue to occur , making it one of the who ##´s targets for accelerated vaccine development . one vaccine candidate is based on live - at ##ten ##uated me ##as ##les virus ( mv ) vaccine encoding the mer ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( mer ##s - s ) . mv ##vac ##2 - mer ##s - s ( h ) induce ##s robust humor ##al and cellular immunity against mer ##s - s media ##ting protection . here , the induction and nature of immunity after va ##cci ##nation with mv ##vac ##2 - mer ##s - s ( h ) or novel mv ##vac ##2 - mer ##s - n were further characterized . we focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced t cells , since functional cd ##8 + t cells contribute importantly to clearance of mer ##s - co ##v . while no immunity against mer ##s - co ##v or mv was detected in mv - susceptible mice after im ##mun ##ization with uv - inactivated virus , replication - competent mv ##vac ##2 - mer ##s - s ( h ) triggered robust neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters also in adult mice . furthermore , a significant fraction of mer ##s co ##v - specific cd ##8 + t cells and mv - specific cd ##4 + t cells simultaneously expressing if ##n - γ and tn ##f - α were induced , revealing that mv ##vac ##2 - mer ##s - s ( h ) induce ##s multi ##fu ##nction ##al cellular immunity .

severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) are two highly trans ##missible and pathogen ##ic viruses that emerged in humans at the beginning of the 21st century . both viruses likely originated in bats , and genetically diverse corona ##virus ##es that are related to sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v were discovered in bats worldwide . in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of these two pathogen ##ic corona ##virus ##es and discuss their receptor usage ; we also highlight the diversity and potential of spill ##over of bat - borne corona ##virus ##es , as evidenced by the recent spill ##over of sw ##ine acute dia ##rr ##hoe ##a syndrome corona ##virus ( sad ##s - co ##v ) to pigs .  
abstract pic ##orn ##avi ##rus ##es ( pv ) and corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) are positive - stranded rna viruses which in ##fect millions of people worldwide each year , resulting in a wide range of clinical outcomes . as reported in this study , using high through ##put screening against [UNK] small molecules , we have identified several novel inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro with ic ##50 of low μ ##m . interesting ##ly , one of them equally inhibit ##ed both 3 ##cp ##ro and 3 ##cl ##pro from pv and co ##v , respectively . using computer modeling , the structural features of these compounds as individual and common pro ##tea ##se inhibitors were el ##uc ##ida ##ted to enhance our knowledge for developing anti - viral agents against pv and co ##v .  
background : a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) has infected more than 75 , 000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries . it is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interact ##s with other micro ##org ##ani ##sms in the lung . methods : we have conducted meta ##tra ##ns ##cript ##ome sequencing for the bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge fluid of eight sar ##s - co ##v - 2 patients , 25 community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) patients , and 20 healthy controls . results : the median number of intra - host variants was 1 - 4 in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected patients , which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples . the distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data ( 110 sequences ) . however , very few intra - host variants were observed in the population as poly ##morphism , implying either a bottle ##neck or pu ##ri ##fying selection involved in the transmission of the virus , or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current poly ##morphism data . although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra - host variants in a person - to - person spread , the risk should not be overlooked . the micro ##bio ##ta in sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected patients was similar to those in cap , either dominated by the pathogen ##s or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory com ##men ##sal bacteria . conclusion : sar ##s - co ##v - 2 evolve ##s in vivo after infection , which may affect its vi ##ru ##lence , in ##fect ##ivity , and trans ##mis ##sibility . although how the intra - host variant spreads in the population is still elusive , it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes .  
background / purpose as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) pan ##de ##mic , the world health organization placed taiwan on the travel alert list from may 21 to july 5 , 2003 . the aim of this study was to explore the post - crisis psychological distress among residents in taiwan after the sar ##s epidemic . methods the target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged ≥ 18 years . data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by st ##rat ##ified random sampling according to geographic area . the survey ( n = 127 ##8 ) was conducted in november 2003 , about 4 months after resolution of the sar ##s crisis in taiwan . the maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95 % confidence level was ± 2 . 74 % . psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject ' s changes in perception of life , plus the five - item brief sy ##mpt ##om rating scale . multi ##var ##iate log ##istic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress . results about 9 . 2 % of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic following the sar ##s crisis . the prevalence of psychiatric mor ##bid ##ity was 11 . 7 % . major predict ##ors of higher levels of pe ##ssi ##mism after the sar ##s epidemic included demographic factors , perception of sar ##s and prepared ##ness , knowing people or having personal experiences of sar ##s - related discrimination , and individual worries and psychiatric mor ##bid ##ity . the co ##rre ##lates of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic cases , as indicated by the five - item brief sy ##mpt ##om rating scale , included age ≥ 50 years , senior high school graduate , and worries about rec ##ur ##rence of sar ##s . conclusion psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the sar ##s epidemic . it is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segment ##ed according to age and education level , which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations .  
numerous viral infections have arise ##n and affected global healthcare facilities . millions of people are at severe risk of acquiring several evolving viral infections through several factors . in the present article we have described about risk factors , chance of infection , and prevention methods of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) frequently cause a normal cold which is mild and self - restricting . zoo ##not ##ic transmission of co ##vs such as the newly discovered mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v , may be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection . the present review provides the recent clinical and path ##ological information on mer ##s and sar ##s . the task is to transform these discoveries about mer ##s and sar ##s pathogen ##esis and to develop intervention methods that will eventually allow the effective control of these recently arising severe viral infections . global health sector has learnt many lessons through the recent outbreak of mer ##s and sar ##s , but the need for identifying new anti ##vira ##l treatment was not learned . in the present article we have reviewed the literature on the several face ##ts like transmission , precautions and effectiveness of treatments used in patients with mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s infections .  
abstract development of effective vaccines , in particular , subunit - based vaccines , against emerging middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) will provide the safe ##st means of preventing the continuous spread of mer ##s in humans and camel ##s . this review briefly describes the structure of the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein and its receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , discusses the current status of mer ##s vaccine development and illustrates the strategies used to develop rb ##d - based subunit vaccines against mer ##s . it also sum ##mar ##izes currently available animal models for mer ##s - co ##v and proposes a future direction for mer ##s vaccines . taken together , this review will assist researchers working to develop effective and safe subunit vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v and any other emerging corona ##virus ##es that might cause future pan ##de ##mics .  
abstract the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) protein contains multiple conform ##ation - dependent ep ##ito ##pes that induce neutral ##izing antibody responses . here we used cho - k ##1 cells to establish a cell line for stable expression of a 193 - mer ( residues 318 – 510 ) rb ##d ( rb ##d ##19 ##3 - cho ) and determined its antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity . we found that rb ##d ##19 ##3 - cho reacted strongly with a panel of six mono ##cl ##onal antibodies recognizing various conform ##ation ##al and linear ep ##ito ##pes in rb ##d , suggesting that this rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein maintains intact conform ##ation and good antigen ##ici ##ty . im ##mun ##ization of mice with rb ##d ##19 ##3 - cho resulted in induction of high ti ##ters of rb ##d - specific neutral ##izing antibodies and potent il - 4 - expressing t cell responses . rb ##d ##19 ##3 - cho induced immunity that protected a majority of the va ##cci ##nated mice from sar ##s - co ##v challenge . these results suggest that the rec ##om ##bina ##nt rb ##d produced in an established stable cell line maintains strong im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity with high potential for use as an effective and economic subunit sar ##s vaccine .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) spread from china to more than 30 countries , causing severe outbreak ##s of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia and over 800 deaths worldwide . co ##v primarily in ##fect ##s the upper respiratory and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract ; however , sar ##s - co ##v has a unique pathogen ##esis because it in ##fect ##s both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and leads to human respiratory diseases . sar ##s - co ##v genome has shown containing 14 open reading frames ( or ##fs ) and 8 of them en ##code novel proteins . previous reports show that over ##ex ##press ##ion of or ##f - 3a , or ##f - 3 ##b and or ##f - 7 ##a induce ap ##op ##tosis . in this report , we demonstrate that over ##ex ##press ##ion of or ##f - 6 also induce ##s ap ##op ##tosis and that cas ##pas ##e - 3 inhibitor and j ##nk inhibitor block or ##f - 6 induced ap ##op ##tosis . importantly , the protein level of er cha ##per ##on protein , gr ##p ##9 ##4 , was up - regulated when or ##f - 6 was over ##ex ##pressed . all these data suggest that or ##f - 6 induce ##s ap ##op ##tosis via cas ##pas ##e - 3 mediated , er stress and j ##nk - dependent pathways .  
summary the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic in asia and northern america led to broad use of various types of di ##sin ##fect ##ant in order to control the public spread of the highly con ##tag ##ious virus . however , only limited data were available to demonstrate their efficacy against sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we therefore investigated eight di ##sin ##fect ##ants for their activity against sar ##s - co ##v according to pre ##n 144 ##7 ##6 . four hand rubs were tested at 30 ##s ( ste ##rill ##ium , based on 45 % iso - prop ##ano ##l , 30 % n - prop ##ano ##l and 0 . 2 % me ##ce ##tron ##ium et ##ils ##ul ##phate ; ste ##rill ##ium rub , based on 80 % ethanol ; ste ##rill ##ium gel , based on 85 % ethanol ; ste ##rill ##ium vi ##rug ##ard , based on 95 % ethanol ) . three surface di ##sin ##fect ##ants were investigated at 0 . 5 % for 30 ##min and 60 ##min ( mi ##kr ##ob ##ac forte , based on benz ##al ##kon ##ium chloride and lau ##ryl ##amine ; ko ##hr ##sol ##in ff , based on benz ##al ##kon ##ium chloride , g ##lu ##tara ##lde ##hy ##de and did ##ec ##yl ##dim ##oni ##um chloride ; di ##smo ##zon pu ##r , based on magnesium mono ##per ##ph ##thal ##ate ) , and one instrument di ##sin ##fect ##ant was investigated at 4 % for 15 ##min , 3 % for 30 ##min and 2 % for 60 ##min [ ko ##rso ##le ##x basic , based on g ##lu ##tara ##lde ##hy ##de and ( et ##hyl ##ened ##io ##xy ) dime ##than ##ol ] . three types of organic load were used : 0 . 3 % album ##in , 10 % fetal calf serum , and 0 . 3 % album ##in with 0 . 3 % sheep er ##yt ##hr ##ocytes . virus ti ##tres were determined by a quantitative test ( end ##point ti ##tra ##tion ) in 96 - well micro ##ti ##tre plates . with all tested preparations , sar ##s - co ##v was inactivated to below the limit of detection ( reduction factor mostly ≥ ##4 ) , regardless of the type of organic load . in summary , sar ##s - co ##v can be inactivated quite easily with many commonly used di ##sin ##fect ##ants .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , an emerging infectious disease introduced in south korea in 2015 , spreads quickly through hospitals , and korea became one of the major areas affected by the disease after the middle east region . to stop the spread of an emerging disease , it is important to practice prevention guidelines correctly . objectives the purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing prevent ##ive behavior against mer ##s - co ##v among korean nursing students . methods this is a cross - sectional study using a question ##naire survey . data were collected from 42 ##9 nursing students from three colleges of nursing in korea from june 25 to july 3 in 2015 . results prevent ##ive behavior against mer ##s - co ##v was affected mostly by attitude ( β = . 243 , p < . 001 ) . such behavior was also high in relation to the variables of perceived risk ( β = . 232 , p < . 001 ) , older students ( β = . 202 , p < . 001 ) , knowledge level ( β = . 153 , p < . 01 ) , and female respondents ( β = . 115 , p < . 05 ) . conclusion prevent ##ive behavior against emerging infectious diseases such as mer ##s - co ##v was found to be affected most significantly by attitude and risk perception . it is crucial to provide nursing students with information or knowledge , but it is also important to help those in nursing education recognize that active prevent ##ive behavior can prevent this infectious disease and stop its spread .  
abstract co ##vid - 19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by a new corona ##virus called sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the world health organization declared the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 outbreak a global public health emergency . we performed genetic analyses of eighty - six complete or near - complete genome ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and revealed many mutations and del ##eti ##ons on coding and non - coding regions . these observations provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of this novel corona ##virus .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) has spread worldwide since 2012 . as the clinical symptoms of mer ##s tend to be non - specific , the inc ##uba ##tion period has been shown to complement differential diagnosis , especially to rule out influenza . however , because an infection event is seldom directly ob ##ser ##vable , the present study aims to construct a diagnostic model that predict ##s the probability of mer ##s diagnosis given the time from immigration to illness onset among imported cases which are suspected of mer ##s . addressing ce ##nsor ##ing by considering the transmission dynamics in an export ##ing country , we demonstrate that the illness onset within 2 days from immigration is suggest ##ive of influenza . two exceptions to suspect mer ##s even for those with illness onset within 2 days since immigration are ( i ) when we observe substantial community transmissions of mer ##s and ( ii ) when the cases are at high risk of mer ##s ( e . g . cases with close contact in hospital or household ) . it is vital to collect the information of the inc ##uba ##tion period upon emergence of a novel infectious disease , and moreover , in our model , the fundamental transmission dynamics including the initial growth rate has to be explored to differentiate the disease dia ##gno ##ses with non - specific symptoms .  
abstract background severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a newly recognized infectious disease that caused an outbreak in south china in 2003 . the cause of sar ##s was identified as a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . the existence of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ser ##oco ##n ##vert ##ors and the detection of the sar ##s - co ##v rna in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that sar ##s could , as least theoretically , be transmitted by trans ##fusion . an estimate of the risk of sar ##s transmission through blood trans ##fusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of trans ##fusion - transmitted infections . study design and methods case onset dates from the 2003 shenzhen sar ##s epidemic and investigation ##al results from taiwan on vi ##rem ##ia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were vi ##rem ##ic throughout the epidemic . estimates of the as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic - to - clinical ##ly confirmed sar ##s - co ##v infection ratio , the proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic infections reported in a ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce survey in hong ##kong , and the population size of shenzhen are used to in ##fer the sar ##s - co ##v trans ##fusion – transmission risk . statistical res ##amp ##ling methods are used . results based on data from shenzhen , hong ##kong and taiwan , the maximum and mean risk ( per million ) of sar ##s - co ##v transmission from donors in shenzhen were estimated as 23 . 57 ( 95 % ci : 6 . 83 – 47 . 69 ) and 14 . 11 ( 95 % ci : 11 . 00 – 17 . 22 ) , respectively . the estimated risk peaked on april 02 , 2003 . conclusions although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of sar ##s - co ##v from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals , recent research data indicate that trans ##fusion - transmitted sar ##s - co ##v is at least theoretically possible . although the risk is low , with its rapid spread of the disease , appearance of alarm ##ingly high in ##fect ##ivity and high fatal ##ity rate , public health authorities need to consider strategies for blood donor recruitment and virus ina ##ct ##ivation during an epidemic to further ensure blood safety .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the et ##iol ##ogical agent of sar ##s . analysis of sar ##s - co ##v spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ( s ) using rec ##om ##bina ##nt pl ##as ##mi ##d and virus infections demonstrated that the s - precursor ( pro ##s ) exists as a [UNK] end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum form and a [UNK] go ##l ##gi - modified form . pro ##s is subsequently processed into two c - terminal proteins of [UNK] and [UNK] . the membrane - bound prop ##rot ##ein convert ##ase ##s ( pcs ) fur ##in , pc ##7 or pc ##5 ##b enhanced the production of the [UNK] protein . in agreement , pro ##s processing , cy ##top ##athic effects , and viral ti ##ters were enhanced in rec ##om ##bina ##nt ve ##ro e ##6 cells over ##ex ##pressing fur ##in , pc ##7 or pc ##5 ##b . the convert ##ase inhibitor dec - rv ##kr - cm ##k significantly reduced pro ##s cleavage and viral ti ##ters of sar ##s - co ##v infected cells . in addition , inhibition of processing by dec - rv ##kr - cm ##k completely ab ##rogated the virus - induced cellular cy ##top ##athic ##ity . a flu ##oro ##genic ##ally que ##nched synthetic peptide encompassing ar ##g ##7 ##6 ##1 of the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein was efficiently cl ##ea ##ved by fur ##in and the cleavage was inhibit ##ed by ed ##ta and dec - rv ##kr - cm ##k . taken together , our data indicate that fur ##in or pc - mediated processing plays a critical role in sar ##s - co ##v spread and cy ##top ##athic ##ity , and inhibitors of the pcs represent potential therapeutic anti - sar ##s - co ##v agents .  
abstract an inactivated vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was evaluated in r ##hes ##us monkeys . the monkeys were in ##oc ##ulated intra ##mus ##cular ##ly ( i . m . ) with 0 . 5 , 5 , 50 , or 5000 ##μ ##g of vaccine , or pbs as control , and boosted on day 7 . after 3 weeks , they were challenged with the ns - 1 strain of sar ##s - co ##v . the humor ##al and mu ##cos ##al immune responses , clinical signs , chemical indices and vi ##rem ##ia were monitored following the im ##mun ##ization and challenge . the control animals who received pbs developed at ##yp ##ical sar - co ##v infection after viral challenge , according to clinical , vi ##rol ##ogical and path ##ological findings . no systematic side effects were observed in va ##cci ##nated animals post - im ##mun ##ization , even in at the high dose of 5000 ##μ ##g . the 50 ##μ ##g dos ##age of vaccine eli ##cite ##d sar ##s - co ##v specific immune responses against viral infection as compared to the partial immunity eli ##cite ##d by 0 . 5 and 5 ##μ ##g doses . the results show that this inactivated vaccine can induce effective con ##com ##itan ##t humor ##al and mu ##cos ##al immunity against sar ##s - co ##v infection , is safe in monkeys , and the vaccine maybe a good candidate for clinical trials .  
summary the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) epidemic started in november 2002 and spread worldwide . the path ##ological changes in several human organs of patients with sar ##s have been extensively described . however , to date , little has been reported about the effects of this infection on the thyroid gland . fe ##moral head nec ##rosis and low serum tri ##io ##dot ##hy ##ron ##ine and thy ##ro ##xin ##e levels , commonly found in patients with sar ##s , raise the possibility of thyroid dysfunction . we have undertaken this study to evaluate for any potential injury to the thyroid gland caused by sar ##s on tissue samples obtained from 5 sar ##s auto ##ps ##ies . the terminal de ##ox ##yn ##uc ##le ##ot ##id ##yl transfer ##ase - mediated du ##pt nick end – labeling ass ##ay was performed to identify ap ##op ##to ##tic cells . the f ##oll ##icular ep ##ith ##eli ##um was found to be damaged with large numbers of cells ex ##folia ##ted into the f ##oll ##icle . the terminal de ##ox ##yn ##uc ##le ##ot ##id ##yl transfer ##ase - mediated du ##pt nick end – labeling ass ##ay demonstrated many cells undergoing ap ##op ##tosis . f ##oll ##icular architecture was altered and showed distortion , dil ##ata ##tion , and collapse . no distinct cal ##cit ##oni ##n - positive cells were detect ##able in the sar ##s thyroid ##s . in conclusion , both para ##fo ##lli ##cular and f ##oll ##icular cells were injured . this may provide an explanation both for low serum tri ##io ##dot ##hy ##ron ##ine and thy ##ro ##xin ##e levels and the os ##te ##one ##cr ##osis of the fe ##moral head associated with patients with sar ##s . ap ##op ##tosis may play a role in the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s associated corona ##virus infection in the thyroid gland .  
summary background the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2002 was caused by a previously unknown corona ##virus — sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we have developed an experimental sar ##s vaccine for direct im ##mun ##isation of the respiratory tract , the major site of sar ##s - corona ##virus transmission and disease . methods we expressed the complete sar ##s corona ##virus envelope spike ( s ) protein from a rec ##om ##bina ##nt at ##ten ##uated para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus ( bhp ##iv ##3 ) that is being developed as a live at ##ten ##uated , intra ##nas ##al pa ##ed ##ia ##tric vaccine against human para ##in ##fl ##uen ##za virus type 3 ( hp ##iv ##3 ) . we im ##mun ##ised eight african green monkeys , four with a single dose of bhp ##iv ##3 / sar ##s - s and four with a control , bhp ##iv ##3 / ct ##rl , administered via the respiratory tract . a sar ##s - corona ##virus challenge was given to all monkeys 28 days after im ##mun ##isation . findings im ##mun ##isation of animals with bhp ##iv ##3 / sar ##s - s induced the production of sar ##s - corona ##virus - neutral ##ising serum antibodies , indicating that a systemic immune response resulted from mu ##cos ##al im ##mun ##isation . after challenge with sar ##s corona ##virus , all monkeys in the control group shed sar ##s corona ##virus , with shed ##ding lasting 5 – 8 days . no viral shed ##ding occurred in the group im ##mun ##ised with bhp ##iv ##3 / sar ##s - s . interpretation a vector ##ed mu ##cos ##al vaccine expressing the sar ##s - corona ##virus s protein alone may be highly effective in a single - dose format for the prevention of sar ##s .  
human corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are enveloped viruses with a positive - sense single - stranded rna genome . currently , six human co ##vs have been reported including human corona ##virus 229 ##e ( hc ##ov - 229 ##e ) , o ##c ##43 ( hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 ) , nl ##6 ##3 ( hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 ) , hk ##u ##1 ( hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , and middle ##ea ##st respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . they cause moderate to severe respiratory and int ##estinal infections in humans . in this review , we focus on recent advances in the research and development of small - molecule anti - human corona ##virus the ##ra ##pies targeting different stages of the co ##v life cycle .  
abstract in this review , we sum ##mar ##ize the researches on animal reservoirs of the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . masked palm ci ##vet ##s were suspected as the origin of the sar ##s outbreak in 2003 and was confirmed as the direct origin of sar ##s cases with mild sy ##mpt ##om in 2004 . sequence analysis of the sar ##s - co ##v - like virus in masked palm ci ##vet ##s indicated that they were highly homo ##log ##ous to human sar ##s - co ##v with nt identity over 99 . 6 % , indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm ci ##vet ##s for a very long time . alignment of 10 complete viral genome sequences from masked palm ci ##vet ##s with those of human sar ##s - co ##vs revealed 26 conserved single - nu ##cle ##otide variations ( s ##n ##vs ) in the viruses from masked palm ci ##vet ##s . these conserved s ##n ##vs were gradually lost from the genome ##s of viruses isolated from the early phase to late phase human patients of the 2003 sar ##s epidemic . in 2005 , horseshoe bats were identified as the natural reservoir of a group of corona ##virus ##es that are distant ##ly related to sar ##s - co ##v . the genome sequences of bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus had about 88 – 92 % nt identity with that of the sar ##s - co ##v . the prevalence of antibodies and viral rna in different bat species and the characteristics of the bat sar ##s - like corona ##virus were el ##uc ##ida ##ted . apart from masked palm ci ##vet ##s and bats , 29 other animal species had been tested for the sar ##s - co ##v , and the results are summarized in this paper .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious condition caused by the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a new member in the family corona ##vir ##idae . to evaluate the lung pathology in this life - threatening respiratory illness , we studied post ##mo ##rte ##m lung sections from 8 patients who died from sar ##s during the spring 2003 singapore outbreak . the predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage . the his ##tology varied according to the duration of illness . cases of 10 or fewer days ’ duration demonstrated acute - phase diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage ( dad ) , airspace ed ##ema , and bro ##nch ##iol ##ar fi ##bri ##n . cases of more than 10 days ’ duration exhibited organizing - phase dad , type ii p ##ne ##um ##oc ##yte hyper ##pl ##asia , sq ##ua ##mous meta ##pl ##asia , multi ##nu ##cle ##ated giant cells , and acute bro ##nch ##op ##ne ##um ##onia . in acute - phase dad , pan ##cy ##tok ##era ##tin stain ##ing was positive in h ##yal ##ine membranes along al ##ve ##olar walls and highlighted the absence of p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . multi ##nu ##cle ##ated cells were shown to be both type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and macro ##pha ##ges by pan ##cy ##tok ##era ##tin , thyroid transcription factor - 1 , and cd ##6 ##8 stain ##ing . sar ##s - co ##v rna was identified by reverse transcript ##ase - polymer ##ase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formal ##in - fixed , para ##ffin - embedded lung tissue , including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue . understanding the pathology of dad in sar ##s patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies . further studies of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of dad .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first identified in 2012 , and it continues to threaten human health worldwide . no mer ##s vaccines are licensed for human use , rein ##for ##cing the urgency to develop safe and e ##ffi ##ca ##cious vaccines to prevent mer ##s . mer ##s - co ##v spike protein forms a trim ##er , and its receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) serves as a vaccine target . nevertheless , the protective efficacy of rb ##d in its native trim ##eric form has never been evaluated . in this study , a trim ##eric protein , rb ##d - f ##d , was generated by fu ##sing rb ##d with fold ##on trim ##eri ##zation motif . it bound strongly to the receptor of mer ##s - co ##v , dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , and eli ##cite ##d robust rb ##d - specific neutral ##izing antibodies in mice , maintaining long - term neutral ##izing activity against mer ##s - co ##v infection . rb ##d - f ##d potent ##ly protected hd ##pp ##4 trans ##genic mice from lethal mer ##s - co ##v challenge . these results suggest that mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d in its trim ##eric form maintains native conform ##ation and induce ##s protective neutral ##izing antibodies , making it a candidate for further therapeutic development .  
abstract objectives to explore the ep ##ide ##mi ##ological and clinical factors predict ##ive of the case fatal ##ity rate ( cf ##r ) of middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in an outbreak in da ##ej ##eon , the republic of korea . methods we reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional mer ##s cases in hospitals a ( 14 cases ) and b ( 11 cases ) , and conducted an in - depth interview with the index case . results the cf ##r in hospital b was higher than that in hospital a ( 63 . 6 % vs . 28 . 6 % , respectively ) . higher mer ##s - co ##v exposure conditions were also found in hospital b , including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and ne ##bu ##lizer use in a six - bed admission room . the host factors associated with high cf ##r were pre - existing pneumonia , smoking history , an inc ##uba ##tion period of less than 5 days , le ##uk ##oc ##yt ##osis , abnormal renal function at diagnosis , and respiratory symptoms such as sp ##ut ##um and d ##ys ##p ##nea . conclusions the conditions surrounding mer ##s - co ##v exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre - existing pneumonia may explain the high cf ##r in hospital b . the clinical features described above may enable prediction of the pro ##gno ##sis of mer ##s cases .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new infectious disease of the 21st century that has pan ##de ##mic potential . a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) was identified as its ae ##ti ##ological agent and its genome was sequence ##d within months of the world health organisation issuing a global threat on sar ##s . the high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality of this potentially pan ##de ##mic infection demands a rapid research response to develop effective anti ##vira ##l treatment and vaccine . this will depend on understanding the pathogen ##esis and immune response to sar ##s co ##v . further understanding of the ecology of sar ##s co ##v in human and animals will help prevent future cross species transmission . likewise for the super - spreading events , cl ##ari ##fication of the underlying reasons will be important to prevent a large scale outbreak of sar ##s . lastly it is of utmost importance that international research collaboration should be strengthened to deal with sar ##s and any other emerging infectious disease that can seriously threaten our future .  
summary background pneumonia is the leading cause of hospital admission during the annual islamic pilgrimage ( ha ##j ##j ) . the et ##iology of severe pneumonia is complex and includes the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . since 2012 , the saudi ministry of health ( mo ##h ) has required screening for mer ##s - co ##v for all cases of severe pneumonia requiring hospital ##ization . we aimed to screen ha ##j ##j pilgrims admitted to healthcare facilities in 2013 with severe community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) for mer ##s - co ##v and to determine other et ##iol ##og ##ies . methods sp ##ut ##um samples were collected from all pilgrims admitted to 15 healthcare facilities in the cities of ma ##kka ##h and medina , saudi arabia , who were diagnosed with severe cap on admission , presenting with bilateral pneumonia . the medical records were reviewed to collect information on age , gender , nationality , and patient outcome . samples were screened for mer ##s - co ##v by pc ##r , and a respiratory multiple ##x array was used to detect up to 22 other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogen ##s . results thirty - eight patients met the inclusion criteria ; they were predominantly elderly ( mean age 58 . 6 years , range 25 – 83 years ) and male ( 68 . 4 % ) , and all were from developing countries . fourteen of the 38 patients died ( 36 . 8 % ) . mer ##s - co ##v was not detected in any of the samples . other respiratory pathogen ##s were detected in 26 ( 68 . 4 % ) samples . of these , bacterial pathogen ##s were detected in 84 . 6 % ( 22 / 26 ) and viruses in 80 . 7 % ( 21 / 26 ) . twenty - one ( 80 . 7 % ) samples were positive for more than one respiratory pathogen and 17 ( 65 . 3 % ) were positive for both bacteria and viruses . the most common respiratory virus was human rhino ##virus , detected in 57 . 7 % of the positive samples , followed by influenza a virus ( 23 . 1 % ) and human corona ##virus ##es ( 19 . 2 % ) . ha ##em ##op ##hil ##us influenza ##e and st ##re ##pt ##oco ##ccus pneumonia ##e were the predominant bacteria , detected in 57 . 7 % and 53 . 8 % , respectively , of the positive samples , followed by mora ##x ##ella cat ##ar ##rh ##alis ( 36 . 4 % ) . conclusions mer ##s - co ##v was not the cause of severe cap in any of the hospitalized pilgrims investigated . however we identified a variety of other respiratory pathogen ##s in the sp ##ut ##um of this small number of patients . this indicates that the et
abstract a novel corona ##virus , termed the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , infected humans in guangdong , china , in november 2002 and the subsequent efficient human - to - human transmissions of this virus caused profound disturbances in over 30 countries worldwide in 2003 . eventually , this epidemic was controlled by isolation and there has been no human infection reported since january 2004 . however , research on different aspects of the sar ##s - co ##v is not wan ##ing , as it is not known if this virus will re - emerge , especially since its origins and potential reservoir ( s ) are un ##res ##olved . the sar ##s - co ##v genome is nearly 30 ##k ##b in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . some of these or ##fs en ##code for genes that are homo ##log ##ous to proteins found in all known corona ##virus ##es , namely the replica ##se genes ( or ##fs 1a and 1b ) and the four structural proteins : nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , spike , membrane and envelope , and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the virus . the remaining eight or ##fs en ##codes for accessory proteins , varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids , which are unique to sar ##s - co ##v . this review will sum ##mar ##ize the ex ##ped ##iti ##ous research on these accessory viral proteins in three major areas : ( i ) the detection of antibodies against accessory proteins in the serum of infected patients , ( ii ) the expression , processing and cellular local ##ization of the accessory proteins , and ( iii ) the effects of the accessory proteins on cellular functions . these in - depth molecular and bio ##chemical characterization ##s of the sar ##s - co ##v accessory proteins , which have no homo ##logue ##s in other corona ##virus ##es , may offer clues as to why the sar ##s - co ##v causes such a severe and rapid attack in humans , while other corona ##virus ##es that in ##fect humans seem to be more for ##giving .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a recently emerged virus that has caused a number of human infections and deaths , primarily in the middle east . the transmission of mer ##s - co ##v to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camel ##s , but evidence of human - to - human transmission also exists . in order to work with mer ##s - co ##v in a laboratory setting , the us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has determined that mer ##s - co ##v should be handled at a bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level ( bs ##l ) 3 ( bs ##l - 3 ) bio ##con ##tain ##ment level . many processes and procedures used to character ##ize mer ##s - co ##v and to evaluate samples from mer ##s - co ##v infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at bs ##l - 2 or lower containment . in order to complete experimental work at bs ##l - 2 , demonstration or proof of ina ##ct ##ivation is required before removal of specimens from bio ##con ##tain ##ment laboratories . in the studies presented here , we evaluated typical means of ina ##ct ##ivating viruses prior to handling specimens at a lower bio ##con ##tain ##ment level . we found that tri ##zo ##l , av ##l buffer and gamma ir ##rad ##iation were effective at ina ##ct ##ivating mer ##s - co ##v , that formal ##deh ##yde - based solutions required at least 30 ##min of contact time in a cell culture system while a mixture of met ##han ##ol and ace ##tone required 60 ##min to ina ##ct ##ivate mer ##s - co ##v . together , these data provide a foundation for safely ina ##ct ##ivating mer ##s - co ##v , and potentially other corona ##virus ##es , prior to removal from bio ##con ##tain ##ment facilities .  
abstract introduction middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) belongs to the family corona ##vir ##idae , and is named for the crown - like spikes on its surface . the clinical presentation of mer ##s - co ##v infection ranges from as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic to very severe disease , and the classical presentation includes fever , cough chill ##s , sore throat , my ##al ##gia , and art ##hra ##l ##gia . methods a cross - sectional study of 339 healthcare personnel was conducted over an 8 - month period in the as ##eer region of saudi arabia using a structured survey that included demographic information and questions testing participant ’ s knowledge . results approximately two - thirds of the respondents properly identified the ca ##usa ##tive agent of mer ##s - co ##v as an rna virus ( 66 . 4 % , n = 225 ) that is enveloped ( 68 . 1 % , n = 231 ) . on the other hand , few respondents identified the proper number of strains or the genus ( 16 . 5 % and 17 . 4 % , respectively ) . more than half of the study sample identified the disease as zoo ##not ##ic ( 57 . 2 % , n = 194 ) . similarly , 89 . 1 % ( n = 302 ) identified that camel ##s and bats are prone to infection with corona ##virus ##es . only 23 . 9 % ( n = 81 ) properly identified march through may as the season with the highest transmission rate . there was a massive lack of adequate knowledge regarding prevalence of antibodies . only 18 . 3 % ( n = 62 ) of respondents identified pc ##r as the proper diagnostic confirm ##atory test for mer ##s - co ##v infection . regarding mer ##s - co ##v clinical features , 76 . 4 % ( n = 259 ) recognized the presence of sub - clinical infection , 64 . 7 % ( n = 218 ) indicated that cases should be immediately isolated , and 46 . 9 % ( n = 159 ) identified the main cause of mortality as respiratory failure . conclusions there is limited micro ##bio ##logical and vi ##rol ##ogical knowledge of mer ##s - co ##v infection among healthcare personnel in the southern region of saudi arabia , although the clinical aspects are known .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the cause of an at ##yp ##ical pneumonia that affected asia , north america and europe in 2002 – 2003 . the viral spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is responsible for media ##ting receptor binding and membrane fusion . recent studies have proposed that the car ##box ##yl terminal portion ( s ##2 subunit ) of the s protein is a class i viral fusion protein . the wi ##ml ##ey and white inter ##fa ##cial hydro ##phobic ##ity scale was used to identify regions within the co ##v s ##2 subunit that may prefer ##ential ##ly associate with lip ##id membranes with the premise that peptide ##s analogous to these regions may function as inhibitors of viral in ##fect ##ivity . five regions of high inter ##fa ##cial hydro ##phobic ##ity spanning the length of the s ##2 subunit of sar ##s - co ##v and mu ##rine hepatitis virus ( m ##h ##v ) were identified . peptide ##s analogous to regions of the n - terminus or the pre - trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain of the s ##2 subunit inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v plaque formation by 40 – 70 % at concentrations of 15 – 30 ##μ ##m . interesting ##ly , peptide ##s analogous to the sar ##s - co ##v or m ##h ##v loop region inhibit ##ed viral plaque formation by > 80 % at similar concentrations . the observed effects were dose - dependent ( ic ##50 values of 2 – 4 ##μ ##m ) and not a result of peptide - mediated cell cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city . the anti ##vira ##l activity of the co ##v peptide ##s tested provides an attractive basis for the development of new fusion peptide inhibitors corresponding to regions outside the fusion protein he ##pta ##d repeat regions .
