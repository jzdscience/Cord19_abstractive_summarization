summary the recently reported middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is phylogenetic ##ally closely related to the bat corona ##virus ##es ( bat ##co ##vs ) hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 . however , the evolutionary pathway of mer ##s - co ##v is still unclear . a receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) in the mer ##s - co ##v envelope - embedded spike protein specifically engages human cd ##26 ( hc ##d ##26 ) to initiate viral entry . the high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if hk ##u ##4 and hk ##u ##5 can recognize hc ##d ##26 for cell entry . we found that hk ##u ##4 - rb ##d , but not hk ##u ##5 - rb ##d , binds to hc ##d ##26 , and pseudo ##type ##d viruses em ##bed ##ding hk ##u ##4 spike can in ##fect cells via hc ##d ##26 recognition . the structure of the hk ##u ##4 - rb ##d / hc ##d ##26 complex revealed a hc ##d ##26 - binding mode similar overall to that observed for mer ##s - rb ##d . hk ##u ##4 - rb ##d , however , is less adapted to hc ##d ##26 than mer ##s - rb ##d , explaining its lower affinity for receptor binding . our findings support a bat origin for mer ##s - co ##v and indicate the need for surveillance of hk ##u ##4 - related viruses in bats .  
the spike ( s ) protein of corona ##virus , which binds to cellular receptors and media ##tes membrane fusion for cell entry , is a candidate vaccine target for blocking corona ##virus infection . however , some animal studies have suggested that inadequate im ##mun ##ization against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s ‐ co ##v ) induce ##s a lung e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic im ##mun ##opa ##th ##ology upon infection . the present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine ad ##ju ##vant ##s for use with rec ##om ##bina ##nt s protein : gold nano ##par ##tic ##les ( au ##np ##s ) , which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an ad ##ju ##vant in im ##mun ##ization ; and toll ‐ like receptor ( t ##lr ) ago ##nist ##s , which have previously been shown to be an effective ad ##ju ##vant in an ultraviolet ‐ inactivated sar ##s ‐ co ##v vaccine . all the mice im ##mun ##ized with more than 0 . 5 µ ##g s protein without ad ##ju ##vant escaped from sar ##s after infection with mouse ‐ adapted sar ##s ‐ co ##v ; however , e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic in ##filtration ##s were observed in the lungs of almost all the im ##mun ##ized mice . the au ##np ‐ ad ##ju ##vant ##ed protein induced a strong i ##gg response but failed to improve vaccine efficacy or to reduce e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic in ##filtration because of highly allergic inflammatory responses . whereas similar virus ti ##ters were observed in the control animals and the animals im ##mun ##ized with s protein with or without au ##np ##s , type 1 inter ##fer ##on and pro ‐ inflammatory responses were moderate in the mice treated with s protein with and without au ##np ##s . on the other hand , the t ##lr ago ##nist ‐ ad ##ju ##vant ##ed vaccine induced highly protective antibodies without e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic in ##filtration ##s , as well as th ##1 / 17 cy ##tok ##ine responses . the findings of this study will support the development of vaccines against severe pneumonia ‐ associated corona ##virus ##es .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) outbreak in 2002 , which had a high mor ##bid ##ity rate and caused worldwide alarm , remains un ##tre ##ated today even though sar ##s was eventually isolated and controlled . development and high - through ##put screening of e ##ffi ##ca ##cious drugs is therefore critical . however , currently there remains a lack of such a safe system . here , the generation and characterization of the first select ##able , sar ##s – corona ##virus ( sar ##s – co ##v ) - based rep ##lic ##on cell line which can be used for screening is described . partial sar ##s – co ##v cd ##nas and anti ##biotic resistance / reporter gene dna were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the rep ##lic ##on transcription template , which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the rep ##lic ##on rna . the latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the trans ##fect ##ed cells were selected for by anti ##biotic application . for the anti ##biotic - resistant cell lines thus generated , the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using fluorescent microscopy and flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry . the suit ##ability of this rep ##lic ##on cell line in drug screening was demonstrated by testing the inhibitor ##y effect of several existing drugs and the results demonstrate that the sar ##s – co ##v rep ##lic ##on cell lines provide a safe tool for the identification of sar ##s – co ##v replica ##se inhibitors . the rep ##lic ##on cell lines thus developed can be applied to high - through ##put screening for anti - sar ##s drugs without the need to grow infectious sar ##s – co ##v .  
abstract sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been identified as the causal agent of a new emerging disease : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . its spike protein s ##2 is responsible for media ##ting fusion of viral and cellular membrane . in this study , we modeled the 3d structure of s ##2 subunit and compared this model with the core structure of gp ##41 from hiv - 1 . we found that sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 and gp ##41 share the same two α he ##lices , suggesting that the two viruses could follow an analogous membrane fusion mechanism . further ligand - binding analysis showed that two inhibitors g ##gl and d - peptide from hiv - 1 gp ##41 may serve as inhibitors for sar ##s - co ##v entry .  
abstract the major concern for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , caused by the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is the lack of diagnostic and therapeutic agents . using a ph ##age display technology in a chicken system , high - affinity mono ##cl ##onal antibody fragments against the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein were characterized . ten truncated spike protein gene fragments were expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli cells . following the im ##mun ##ization of chickens with these rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike proteins , two single - chain variable fragment ( sc ##f ##v ) antibody libraries were established with short or long link ##ers to contain 5 ##× ##10 ##7 and 9 ##× ##10 ##6 transform ##ants , respectively . after four rounds of pan ##ning selection , the sc ##f ##v antibodies of randomly chosen clones were demonstrated by co ##oma ##ssi ##e blue stain ##ing , and verified by western b ##lot analysis . in a comparison of nu ##cle ##otide sequences with the chicken ge ##rm ##line gene , we found that all clones varied in the complement ##ari ##ty - determining regions , that two sc ##f ##v antibodies reacted significantly with sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro cells , and that those two specific sc ##f ##v antibodies recognized the same region of the spike protein spanning amino acid residues 750 – 1000 . in conclusion , the results suggest that the chicken sc ##f ##v ph ##age display system can be a potential model for mass production of high - affinity antibodies against the sar ##s - co ##v spike protein .  
abstract we have previously observed that all known hiv - 1 broadly neutral ##izing antibodies ( bn ##ab ##s ) are highly diver ##gent from ge ##rm ##line antibodies in contrast to bn ##ab ##s against hen ##dra virus , ni ##pa ##h virus and sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) . we have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that because the ge ##rm ##line antibodies are so different from the mature hiv - 1 - specific bn ##ab ##s they may not bind the ep ##ito ##pes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual put ##ative ge ##rm ##line - like predecessor antibodies . to further valid ##ate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses , two ph ##age - displayed human cord blood - derived i ##gm libraries were constructed which contained mostly ge ##rm ##line antibodies or antibodies with very low level of so ##matic hyper ##mut ##ations . they were pan ##ned against different hiv - 1 envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( en ##vs ) , sar ##s co ##v protein receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , and soluble hen ##dra virus g protein ( sg ) . despite a high sequence and comb ##inator ##ial diversity observed in the cord blood - derived i ##gm antibody repertoire , no enrichment for bind ##ers of en ##vs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichment ##s produced with pan ##ning against rb ##d and sg ; one of the selected mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( against the rb ##d ) was of high ( nm ) affinity with only few so ##matic mutations . these results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to eli ##cit ##ation of bn ##ab ##s against hiv - 1 compared to sar ##s co ##v and hen ##dra virus . hiv - 1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of ge ##rm ##line antibodies to its en ##v ; in contrast , sar ##s co ##v and hen ##dra virus , and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections , can bind ge ##rm ##line antibody or minimal ##ly so ##matic ##ally mu ##tated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sg and rb ##d as vaccine im ##mun ##ogen ##s .  
we studied structural and im ##mun ##ological properties of the sar ##s - co ##v m ( membrane ) protein , based on comparative analyses of sequence features , phylogenetic investigation , and experimental results . the m protein is predicted to contain a triple - spanning trans ##me ##mb ##rane ( t ##m ) region , a single n - g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion site near its n - terminus that is in the exterior of the vi ##rion , and a long c - terminal region in the interior . the m protein harbor ##s a higher substitution rate ( 0 . 6 % correlated to its size ) among viral open reading frames ( or ##fs ) from published data . the four substitution ##s detected in the m protein , which cause non - synonymous changes , can be classified into three types . one of them results in changes of pi ( iso ##ele ##ctric point ) and charge , affecting antigen ##ici ##ty . the second changes hydro ##phobic ##ity of the t ##m region , and the third one relates to hydro ##phi ##lic ##ity of the interior structure . phylogenetic tree building based on the variations of the m protein appears to support the non - human origin of sar ##s - co ##v . to investigate its im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity , we synthesized eight ol ##igo ##pe ##pt ##ides covering 69 . 2 % of the entire or ##f and screened them by using elisa ( enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ) with sera from sar ##s patients . the results confirmed our predictions on antigen ##ic sites .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a novel lethal zoo ##not ##ic disease of humans caused by the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . although mer ##s is endemic to the middle east , travelers have exported mer ##s - co ##v on return to their home countries . clinical manifestation ##s range from mild to severe acute respiratory disease and death . the elderly , im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised , and those with chronic como ##rb ##id liver , lung , and he ##pati ##c conditions have a high mortality rate . there is no specific treatment . person - to - person spread causes hospital and household outbreak ##s , and thus improved compliance with internationally recommended infection control protocols and rapid implementation of infection control measures are required .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to be a threat to human health in the middle east . development of counter ##me ##as ##ures is ongoing ; however , an animal model that faithful ##ly rec ##ap ##it ##ulates human disease has yet to be defined . a recent study indicated that in ##oc ##ulation of common mar ##mos ##ets resulted in inconsistent lethal ##ity . based on these data we sought to compare two isolate ##s of mer ##s - co ##v . we followed disease progression in common mar ##mos ##ets after intra ##tra ##che ##al exposure with : mer ##s - co ##v - em ##c / 2012 , mer ##s - co ##v - jordan - n ##3 / 2012 , media , or inactivated virus . our data suggest that common mar ##mos ##ets developed a mild to moderate non - lethal respiratory disease , which was quan ##ti ##fia ##ble by computed tom ##ography ( ct ) , with limited other clinical signs . based on ct data , clinical data , and vi ##rol ##ogical data , mer ##s - co ##v in ##oc ##ulation of common mar ##mos ##ets results in mild to moderate clinical signs of disease that are likely due to manipulation ##s of the mar ##mos ##et rather than as a result of robust viral replication .  
abstract the precise mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , which is caused by sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , is still unclear . we generated rec ##om ##bina ##nt va ##cci ##nia virus ( rv ##v ) lc ##16 ##m ##8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , including nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) , membrane ( m ) , en ##vel ##op ( e ) , spike ( s ) proteins ( rv ##v - nme ##s ) and reported that old bal ##b / c mice having prior im ##mun ##ization with rv ##v - nme ##s develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rv ##v - nme ##s - im ##mun ##ized mice showed lower pulmonary viral ti ##ter than in the control mice . furthermore , we determined which sar ##s - co ##v structural protein for the prior rv ##v - im ##mun ##ization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the sar ##s - co ##v infection as observed in the rv ##v - nme ##s - im ##mun ##ized mice . old bal ##b / c mice were in ##oc ##ulated intra ##der ##mal ##ly with rv ##v that expressed each structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v ( rv ##v - n , - m , - e , or - s ) with or without rv ##v - s and then infected intra ##nas ##ally with sar ##s - co ##v more than 4 weeks later . at 9 days after sar ##s - co ##v infection , the rv ##v - n - im ##mun ##ized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups . furthermore , significant up - regulation of th ##1 ( il - 2 ) - and th ##2 ( il - 4 and il - 5 ) - bias cy ##tok ##ines and down - regulation of anti - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine ( il - 10 and t ##gf - β ) were observed in rv ##v - n - im ##mun ##ized mice , resulting in the intensive in ##filtration of im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##ete ##nt cells into the lung . in contrast , rv ##v - s - im ##mun ##ized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia . however , the mice having co - im ##mun ##ization with both rv ##v - n and rv ##v - s showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral ti ##ter was low . these results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the n protein of sar ##s - co ##v is involved in severe pneumonia caused by sar ##s - co ##v infection . these findings increase our understanding of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s .  
abstract introduction mortality due to mer ##s - co ##v infection is common especially among im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised patients . the pathogen ##esis and the transmission mode of this virus are still not well understood . the name of the virus is derived from the area of its appearance and the gen ##omic sequence that was used in the development of q ##rt - pc ##r ass ##ays for mer ##s - co ##v detection was retrieved from the first detected case isolate . the employed ass ##ays target various regions including the area upstream of the envelope gene ( up ##e ) that is used for screening and the open reading frames ( or ##f ) 1a and 1b used for confirmation . aim this study assess ##es the use of a mer ##s - co ##v specific ass ##ay for screening of respiratory samples in anticipation of the possible spread of the virus in the region . methods 46 respiratory specimens were tested using the qu ##ali ##tative one - step q ##rt - pc ##r genes ##ig human corona ##virus 2012 ( mer ##s ) kit ( prime ##rdes ##ign ##™ ) . results out of the 46 tested samples , 45 were negative for mer ##s - co ##v and one sample was found mer ##s - co ##v positive . conclusion the genes ##ig human corona ##virus 2012 ( mer ##s ) kit is very useful for the screening of suspected respiratory cases in the middle east area as well as other regions .  
abstract to warrant potential clinical testing , the e ##quin ##e anti - sar ##s – co ##v f ( ab ′ ) 2 requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible and a safety test in a primate model . in this study , we evaluated the ph ##arm ##aco ##kin ##etic ##s , tolerance and immunity of this kind of antibody in mac ##aq ##ues and rats . results showed that the f ( ab ′ ) 2 fragments had a normal metabolism in injected animals . the general physiological index ##es did not differ between animals injected with anti - sar ##s – co ##v f ( ab ′ ) 2 or saline . however , a mild inflammatory response in local injection site and a moderate immune response against this antibody in the successively injected animals were observed , which however recovered 3 weeks after the last injection . the antibody ti ##tri ##ng from 1 : 100 to 400 against the e ##quin ##e anti - sar ##s – co ##v f ( ab ′ ) 2 in the in ##oc ##ulated hosts could be detected at week 2 during the successive injection ##s of the e ##quin ##e f ( ab ′ ) 2 . the considerable safety of this antibody used in primate ##s and the fact that the immune system of the host can be motivated by post - injection of the f ( ab ′ ) 2 indicate that this type of anti - sar ##s – co ##v antibody can be used for prevention and treatment of sas ##r , especially at the early stage of this virus infection . in addition , it can also provide the precious time for the combined use of other anti - sar ##s – co ##v agents such as anti ##vira ##l drug and vaccine .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein , a type i membrane - bound protein , is essential for the viral attachment to the host cell receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . by screening 312 controlled chinese medicinal herbs supervised by committee on chinese medicine and pharmacy at taiwan , we identified that three widely used chinese medicinal herbs of the family poly ##gon ##aceae inhibit ##ed the interaction of sar ##s - co ##v s protein and ace ##2 . the ic ##50 values for ra ##di ##x et r ##hi ##zo ##ma r ##hei ( the root tube ##rs of r ##he ##um off ##ici ##nal ##e bail ##l . ) , ra ##di ##x poly ##gon ##i multi ##fl ##ori ( the root tube ##rs of poly ##gon ##um multi ##fl ##orum th ##un ##b . ) , and ca ##uli ##s poly ##gon ##i multi ##fl ##ori ( the vines of p . multi ##fl ##orum th ##un ##b . ) ranged from 1 to 10 ##μ ##g / ml . em ##od ##in , an ant ##hra ##quin ##one compound derived from genus r ##he ##um and poly ##gon ##um , significantly blocked the s protein and ace ##2 interaction in a dose - dependent manner . it also inhibit ##ed the in ##fect ##ivity of s protein - pseudo ##type ##d retro ##virus to ve ##ro e ##6 cells . these findings suggested that em ##od ##in may be considered as a potential lead therapeutic agent in the treatment of sar ##s .  
objective : to describe the infection control prepared ##ness measures undertaken for corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) due to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( previously known as 2019 novel corona ##virus ) in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in china , on december 31 , 2019 ( day 1 ) in hong kong . methods : a bundled approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance , early airborne infection isolation , rapid molecular diagnostic testing , and contact tracing for healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) with un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure in the hospitals was implemented . ep ##ide ##mi ##ological characteristics of confirmed cases , environmental samples , and air samples were collected and analyzed . results : from day 1 to day 42 , 42 of 1 , 275 patients ( 3 . 3 % ) fulfilling active ( n = 29 ) and enhanced laboratory surveillance ( n = 13 ) were confirmed to have the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection . the number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 of 13 confirmed cases ( 7 . 7 % , day 22 to day 32 ) to 27 of 29 confirmed cases ( 93 . 1 % , day 33 to day 42 ; p < . 001 ) . among them , 28 patients ( 66 . 6 % ) came from 8 family clusters . of 41 ##3 hc ##ws caring for these confirmed cases , 11 ( 2 . 7 % ) had un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure requiring qu ##aran ##tine for 14 days . none of these was infected , and nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was not observed . environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3 . 3 × 10 ( 6 ) copies / ml ( poole ##d nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and throat sw ##ab ##s ) and 5 . 9 × 10 ( 6 ) copies / ml ( saliva ) , respectively . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples ( 7 . 7 % ) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient ’ s chin with or without wearing a surgical mask . conclusion : appropriate hospital infection control measures was able to prevent nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract mu ##rine anti ##ser ##a with neutral ##ising activity for the corona ##virus ca ##usa ##tive of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) were induced by im ##mun ##isation of bal ##b / c mice with the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the viral spike protein . the mu ##rine anti ##ser ##a induced were fully - neutral ##ising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . to test the neutral ##ising capacity of these anti ##ser ##a in vivo , su ##sc ##ept ##ibility to mer ##s - co ##v was induced in naive recipient bal ##b / c mice by the administration of an aden ##ov ##irus vector expressing the human d ##pp ##4 receptor ( ad ##5 - hd ##pp ##4 ) for mer ##s - co ##v , prior to the passive transfer of the rb ##d - specific mu ##rine anti ##ser ##a to the trans ##duced mice . subsequent challenge of the recipient trans ##duced mice by the intra - nasal route with a clinical isolate of the mer ##s - co ##v resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs , compared with trans ##duced mice receiving a negative control antibody . the mu ##rine anti ##ser ##a used were derived from mice which had been prime ##d sub - cut ##aneous ##ly with a rec ##om ##bina ##nt fusion of rb ##d with a human i ##gg fc tag ( rb ##d - fc ) , ads ##or ##bed to calcium phosphate micro ##cr ##yst ##als and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse mice ##lles . the data gained indicate that this dual - route va ##cci ##nation with novel formulation ##s of the rb ##d - fc , induced systemic and mu ##cos ##al anti - viral immunity with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo neutral ##isation capacity for clinical strains of mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) plays key roles in viral replication and is an attractive target for anti - sar ##s drug discovery . in this report , a flu ##orescence resonance energy transfer ( fr ##et ) - based method was developed to assess the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic activity of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . two internally que ##nched flu ##oro ##genic peptide ##s , 1 ##nc and 2 ##nc , corresponding to the n - terminal and the c - terminal auto ##cle ##ava ##ge sites of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro , respectively , were used as substrates . sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro seemed to work more efficiently on 1 ##nc than on 2 ##nc in trans - cleavage ass ##ay . mutation ##al analysis demonstrated that the his ##41 residue , the n - terminal 7 amino acids , and the domain iii of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro were important for the en ##zy ##matic activity . antibodies recognizing domain iii could significantly inhibit the en ##zy ##matic activity of sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro . the effects of class - specific pro ##tea ##se inhibitors on the trans - cleavage activity revealed that this enzyme worked more like a ser ##ine pro ##tea ##se rather than the papa ##in pro ##tea ##se .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an acute newly emerged infectious respiratory illness . the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of sar ##s was named ‘ sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ’ ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that can be detected with reverse transcription - polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) ass ##ays . in this study , 12 sets of nest ##ed prime ##rs covering the sar ##s - co ##v genome have been screened and showed sufficient sensitivity to detect sar ##s - co ##v in rna isolated from virus culture ##d in ve ##ro 6 cells . to opt ##imi ##ze further the reaction condition of those nest ##ed prime ##rs sets , seven sets of nest ##ed prime ##rs have been chosen to compare their reverse transcribed efficiency with specific and random prime ##rs , which is useful to combine rt with the first round of pc ##r into a one - step rt - pc ##r . based on the sensitivity and simplicity of results , the no . 73 prime ##r set was chosen as the candidate prime ##r set for clinical dia ##gno ##ses . to specify the amp ##lic ##on to minimize false positive results , a ta ##q ##man rt - nest ##ed pc ##r system of no . 73 nest ##ed prime ##r set was developed . through investigations on a test panel of whole blood obtained from 30 sar ##s patients and 9 control persons , the specific ##ity and sensitivity of the ta ##q ##man rt - nest ##ed pc ##r system was found to be 100 and 83 % , respectively , which suggests that the method is a promising one to dia ##gno ##se sar ##s in early stages .  
abstract spike ( s ) protein is the most important membrane protein on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . it associates with cellular receptors to media ##te infection of their target cells . inspired by such a mechanism , an in - depth investigation into the genome sequences of s protein of sar ##s - co ##v and its receptor are conducted thru a mathematical transformation and graphic approach . as an outcome , a novel method for visual ##izing the characteristic of sar ##s - co ##v is suggested . an extensive comparison among a large number of genome sequences has proved that the characteristic thus revealed is unique for sar ##s - co ##v . as such , the characteristic can be regarded as the finger ##print map of sar ##s - co ##v for diagnostic usage . moreover , the conclusion has been further supported in a real case in guangdong province of china . the finger ##print map proposed here has the merits of clear visibility and reliability that can serve as a complementary clinical tool for detecting sar ##s - co ##v , particularly for the cases where the results obtained by the conventional methods are uncertain or conflict ##ed with each other .  
severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , emerged from china and rapidly spread worldwide . over 80 ##9 ##8 people fell ill and 77 ##4 died before the epidemic ended in july 2003 . bats are likely an important reservoir for sar ##s - co ##v . sar ##s - like co ##vs have been detected in horseshoe bats and ci ##vet cats . the main mode of transmission of sar ##s - co ##v is through in ##hala ##tion of respiratory droplets . fae ##co - oral transmission has been recorded . strict infection control procedures with respiratory and contact precautions are essential . fever and respiratory symptoms pre ##dom ##inate , and dia ##rr ##hea is common . treatment involves supportive care . there are no specific anti ##vira ##l treatments or vaccines available .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) in ##fect humans and many animal species , and are associated with respiratory , enter ##ic , he ##pati ##c , and central nervous system diseases . the large size of the co ##v genome and the instability of some co ##v replica ##se gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria , represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense rna viruses . to overcome these limitations , several alternatives to more conventional pl ##as ##mi ##d - based approaches have been established in the last 13 years . in this report , we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for co ##vs , paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome co ##v ( sar ##s - co ##v ) .  
summary background over 2500 ##0 pilgrims from the uk visit saudi arabia every year for the um ##rah and ha ##j ##j pilgrimage ##s . the recent outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in south korea and the continuing reports of mer ##s - co ##v cases from saudi arabia highlight the need for active surveillance for mer ##s - co ##v in returning pilgrims or travellers from the middle east . public health england birmingham laboratory ( ph ##eb ##l ) is one of a few selected uk public health laboratories responsible for mer ##s - co ##v screening in travellers returning to the uk from the middle east who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms . the results of the ph ##eb ##l mer ##s - co ##v screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented . methods uk travellers / pilgrims who returned from the middle east and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period february 1 , 2013 to december 31 , 2015 . patients with respiratory symptoms , who satisfied the public health england mer ##s - co ##v case algorithm , were tested for mer ##s - co ##v and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital . results two hundred and two patients suspected of having mer ##s - co ##v were tested . none of them had a laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection . a viral ae ##ti ##ology was detected in half ( 50 . 3 % ) of the cases , with rhino ##virus ##es , influenza a ( h ##1 ##n ##1 and h ##3 ##n ##2 ) , and influenza b being most frequent . peak testing occurred following the annual ha ##j ##j season and in other periods of raised national awareness . conclusions respiratory tract infections in travellers / pilgrims returning to the uk from the middle east are mainly due to rhino ##virus ##es , influenza a , and influenza b . whilst mer ##s - co ##v was not detected in the 202 patients studied , heightened awareness of the possibility of mer ##s - co ##v and continuous pro ##active surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of mer ##s - co ##v and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as av ##ian influenza , in patients presenting to hospital . early identification and isolation may prevent outbreak ##s in nos ##oco ##mia ##l settings .  
abstract we have investigated to develop novel vaccines against sar ##s co ##v using cd ##na construct ##s encoding the structural antigen ; spike protein ( s ) , membrane protein ( m ) , envelope protein ( e ) , or nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein , derived from sar ##s co ##v . mice va ##cci ##nated with sar ##s - n or - m dna using pc ##dna 3 . 1 ( + ) pl ##as ##mi ##d vector showed t cell immune responses ( ct ##l induction and proliferation ) against n or m protein , respectively . ct ##l responses were also detected to sar ##s dna - trans ##fect ##ed type ii al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elial cells ( t ##7 cell clone ) , which are thought to be initial target cells for sar ##s virus infection in human . to determine whether these dna vaccines could induce t cell immune responses in humans as well as in mice , sci ##d - p ##bl / hu mice was im ##mun ##ized with these dna vaccines . as expected , virus - specific ct ##l responses and t cell proliferation were induced from human t cells . sar ##s - n and sar ##s - m dna vaccines and sci ##d - p ##bl / hu mouse model will be important in the development of protective vaccines .  
abstract the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . the development of rapid screening ass ##ays is essential for anti ##vira ##l drug discovery . by using a cell line expressing a sar ##s - co ##v sub ##gen ##omic rep ##lic ##on , we developed a high - through ##put ass ##ay and used it to screen small molecule compounds for inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v replication in the absence of live virus . the ass ##ay system involves minimal manipulation after ass ##ay set - up , facilitates automated read - out and minimize ##s risks associated with hazardous viruses . based on this ass ##ay system , we screened 70 ##35 small molecule compounds from which we identified 7 compounds with anti - sar ##s - co ##v activity . we demonstrate that the compounds inhibit ##ed sar ##s - co ##v replication - dependent g ##fp expression in the rep ##lic ##on cells and reduced sar ##s - co ##v viral protein accumulation and viral rna copy number in the rep ##lic ##on cells . in a sar ##s - co ##v plaque reduction ass ##ay , these compounds were confirmed to have anti ##vira ##l activity . the target of one of the hit compounds , c1 ##23 ##44 , was valid ##ated by the generation of resistant rep ##lic ##on cells and the identification of the mutations con ##fer ##ring the resistant ph ##eno ##type . these compounds should be valuable for developing anti - sar ##s therapeutic drugs as well as research tools to study the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v replication .  
we prepared the three - dimensional model of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ( aka 2019 - nc ##ov ) 3 ##c - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ( pro ) ) using the crystal structure of the highly similar ( 96 % identity ) or ##th ##olo ##g from the sar ##s - co ##v . all residues involved in the cat ##aly ##sis , substrate binding and dime ##ris ##ation are 100 % conserved . comparison of the poly ##pro ##tein pp ##1 ##ab sequences showed 86 % identity . the 3 ##c - like cleavage sites on the corona ##vira ##l poly ##pro ##tein ##s are highly conserved . based on the near - identical substrate specific ##ities and high sequence identities , we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the sar ##s - co ##v enzyme can be conferred on its sar ##s - co ##v - 2 counterpart . with the 3 ##cl ( pro ) molecular model , we performed virtual screening for pu ##rch ##asa ##ble drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration . among these , the anti ##vira ##ls led ##ip ##as ##vir or ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir are particularly attractive as therapeutic ##s to combat the new corona ##virus with minimal side effects , commonly fatigue and headache . the drugs ep ##cl ##usa ( ve ##lp ##ata ##s ##vir / so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir ) and ha ##r ##von ##i ( led ##ip ##as ##vir / so ##fo ##sb ##u ##vir ) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitor ##y actions on two viral enzymes .  
a mysterious outbreak of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in wu ##han of china . within a few weeks , a novel corona ##virus tentatively named as 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) was announced by the world health organization . we performed bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019 - nc ##ov infection and compared it with other related corona ##virus genome ##s . overall , the genome of 2019 - nc ##ov has 89 % nu ##cle ##otide identity with bat sar ##s - like - co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 and 82 % with that of human sar ##s - co ##v . the phylogenetic trees of their or ##f ##1 ##a / b , spike , envelope , membrane and nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein also clustered closely with those of the bat , ci ##vet and human sar ##s corona ##virus ##es . however , the external sub ##dom ##ain of spike ’ s receptor binding domain of 2019 - nc ##ov shares only 40 % amino acid identity with other sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es . remarkably , its or ##f ##3 ##b en ##codes a completely novel short protein . furthermore , its new or ##f ##8 likely en ##codes a secret ##ed protein with an alpha - helix , following with a beta - sheet ( s ) containing six strands . learning from the roles of ci ##vet in sar ##s and camel in mer ##s , hunting for the animal source of 2019 - nc ##ov and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage b beta ##cor ##ona ##virus . these findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogen ##esis , and opt ##imi ##zing the design of diagnostic , anti ##vira ##l and va ##cci ##nation strategies for this emerging infection .  
abstract the emergence of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , triggered the discovery of a high diversity of corona ##virus ##es in bats . studies from europe have shown that corona ##virus ##es ci ##rc ##ulate in bats in france but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity . in the current study the diversity of corona ##virus ##es circulating in western europe was extensively explored . ten alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es in eleven bat species belonging to the mini ##op ##ter ##idae , ve ##sper ##ti ##lion ##idae and rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae families and , a sar ##s - co ##v - related beta ##cor ##ona ##virus in rhino ##lo ##phus fe ##rr ##ume ##quin ##um were identified . the diversity and prevalence of bat corona ##virus ##es presently reported from western europe is much higher than previously described and includes a sar ##s - co ##v sister group . this diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of corona ##virus ##es in this species . that said , the identified corona ##virus ##es were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus , and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location . the observed phylogenetic grouping of corona ##virus ##es from the same species in europe and asia , emphasizes the role of host / pathogen coe ##vo ##lu ##tion in this group .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers ( hc ##ws ) , patients and visitors . the efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreak ##s of sar ##s in canada , china , hong kong , singapore , taiwan and vietnam . the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s was identified as a novel corona ##virus , the sar ##s corona ##virus . this was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets , although airborne transmission has also been reported . high infection rates among hc ##ws led initially to the theory that sar ##s was highly con ##tag ##ious and the concept of ‘ super - spreading events ’ . such events illustrated that lack of infection control ( ic ) measures or failure to comply with ic precautions could lead to large - scale hospital outbreak ##s . sar ##s was eventually contained by the string ##ent application of ic measures that limited exposure of hc ##ws to potentially infectious individuals . as the ‘ global village ’ becomes smaller and other micro ##bial threats to health emerge , or re - emerge , there is an urgent need to develop a global strategy for infection control in hospitals . this paper provides an overview of the main ic practices employed during the 2003 sar ##s outbreak , including management measures , dedicated sar ##s hospitals , personal protective equipment , isolation , hand ##wash ##ing , environmental deco ##nta ##mina ##tion , education and training . the psychological and psycho ##so ##cial impact on hc ##ws during the outbreak are also discussed . requirements for ic programmes in the post - sar ##s period are proposed based on the major lessons learnt from the sar ##s outbreak .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a newly identified pathogen able of human transmission that causes a mortality of almost 40 % . as in the case of sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s virus lacking e protein represents a potential vaccine . in both cases , ab ##olis ##hm ##ent of channel activity may be a contributor to the at ##ten ##uation observed in e - deleted viruses . here ##in , we report that pu ##rified mer ##s - co ##v e protein , like sar ##s - co ##v e protein , is almost fully α - he ##lica ##l , has a single α - he ##lica ##l trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain , and forms pen ##tam ##eric ion channels in lip ##id bi ##layer ##s . based on these similarities , and the proposed involvement of channel activity as vi ##ru ##lence factor in sar ##s - co ##v e protein , mer ##s - co ##v e protein may constitute a potential drug target .  
abstract the outbreak of sar ##s , a life - threatening disease , has spread over many countries around the world . so far there is no effective drug for the treatment of sar ##s . stimulated by the binding mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro with the oct ##ape ##pt ##ide av ##l ##q ##sg ##fr reported recently as well as the “ cho ##u ' s distorted key ” theory , we synthesized the oct ##ape ##pt ##ide av ##l ##q ##sg ##fr for conducting various bio ##chemical experiments to investigate the anti ##vira ##l potential of the oct ##ape ##pt ##ide against sar ##s corona ##virus ( b ##j - 01 ) . the results demonstrate that , compared with other compounds reported so far , av ##l ##q ##sg ##fr is the most active in inhibit ##ing replication of the sar ##s corona ##virus , and that no detect ##able toxicity is observed on ve ##ro cells under the condition of experimental concentration .  
seven corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have been isolated from humans so far . among them , three emerging pathogen ##ic co ##vs , including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , and a newly identified co ##v ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans , posing significant threats to global public health . sar ##s - co ##v infection in humans ( with about 10 % case fatal ##ity rate ) was first reported from china in 2002 , while mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans ( with about 34 . 4 % case fatal ##ity rate ) was first reported from saudi arabia in june 2012 . 2019 - nc ##ov was first reported from china in december 2019 , and is currently in ##fect ##ing more than 700 ##00 people ( with about 2 . 7 % case fatal ##ity rate ) . both sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v are zoo ##not ##ic viruses , using bats as their natural reservoirs , and then transmitting through intermediate hosts , leading to human infections . nevertheless , the intermediate host for 2019 - nc ##ov is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new co ##v have not been available . although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , none of them has been approved for use in humans . in this review , we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human co ##vs , overview ##ed the current vaccine types to be developed against sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogen ##ic human co ##vs . these subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full - length spike ( s ) protein , receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , non - rb ##d s protein fragments , and non - s structural proteins , and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated . overall , this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019 - nc ##ov and any future co ##vs with pan ##de ##mic potential . this review was written for the topic of anti ##vira ##ls for emerging viruses : vaccines and therapeutic ##s in the vi ##rol ##ogy section of frontiers in micro ##biology .  
abstract cellular immune response plays an important role in anti ##vira ##l immunity . in our previous study , im ##mun ##ization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s co ##v ) spike ( s ) dna vaccine could induce both humor ##al and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping s peptide ##s . identification of functional dominant ep ##ito ##pes in sar ##s co ##v s protein for t cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses eli ##cite ##d by sar ##s co ##v s dna vaccine . in present study , mice were im ##mun ##ized with sar ##s co ##v s dna vaccine . subsequently , a pool of 17 – 19 mer ##s overlap ##ped sar ##s co ##v s peptide ##s , which served as im ##mun ##ogen ##s , were scanned to identify the specific ep ##ito ##pes for t cells . two h - 2d restricted cd ##4 + t ep ##ito ##pes , n ##60 ( s ##43 ##5 – 44 ##4 ) and p ##15 ##2 ( s ##11 ##11 – 112 ##7 ) , and two h - 2d restricted cd ##8 + t cell ep ##ito ##pes , n ##50 ( s ##36 ##5 – 37 ##4 ) and p ##14 ##1 ( s ##10 ##31 – 104 ##7 ) were identified by three different methods , enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , enzyme linked im ##mun ##os ##pot ass ##ay ( eli ##sp ##ot ) and flu ##orescence activated cell sort ##er ( fa ##cs ) . the dominant cd ##4 + t cell ep ##ito ##pe ( n ##60 ) and cd ##8 + t cell ep ##ito ##pe ( n ##50 ) located in the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s co ##v s protein , which mediated virus combining and fu ##sing to susceptible cells . importantly , our novel finding is that mice prime ##d with sar ##s s dna vaccine and boosted with t cell ep ##ito ##pes ( n ##50 and n ##60 ) could promote antigen specific cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cell immune responses . our study provides valuable information for the design of vaccine for sar ##s study .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first described in 2012 and , subsequently , many cases were reported with a lower case fatal ##ity rate than initial cases . humans can become infected within their communities and transmission can then be amplified in the healthcare setting . contact investigation among cases shows a variable amount of spread among family members and healthcare workers . so far , circulating virus strains remain similar under continuous monitoring , with no genetic changes . here , we discuss the transmission pattern , phylogenetic evolution , and pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
the sar ##s corona ##virus was identified as the pathogen of a global outbreak of sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) in 2003 . its large rna genome en ##codes four structural proteins , sixteen non - structural proteins and eight accessory proteins . the availability of structures of sar ##s corona ##virus macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s has enabled the el ##uc ##ida ##tion of their important functions , such as media ##ting the fusion of viral and host cellular membranes , and in replication and transcription . in particular , the spike protein fusion core and the main pro ##tea ##se have been the most extensively studied , with the aim of designing anti - sar ##s therapeutic ##s . attention is now being focused on replica ##se proteins , which should enhance our understanding of the replication and transcription machinery . the structures and functions of most sar ##s proteins remain unknown , and further structural studies will be important for revealing their functions and for designing potential anti - sar ##s therapeutic ##s .  
despite years of research , the precise deter ##mina ##nts of corona ##virus replication and pathogen ##esis remain unidentified . what is known of the pathogen ##esis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is limited , but clinical observations suggest that both viral - induced cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city and host immune - mediated destruction contribute to the severity of disease . this summary discusses recent advances in corona ##virus research that will facilitate the identification of crucial molecular targets for the rational design of sar ##s therapeutic ##s . section editor : anne mo ##sco ##na – department of pediatric ##s , mount sinai school of medicine , one gustave l . levy place , box 119 ##8 , new york , ny 100 ##29 , usa when the sar ##s corona ##virus came dramatically to attention as a fatal and potentially pan ##de ##mic respiratory disease , the scientific response was swift and effective . the et ##iol ##ogical agent was identified , the genome was clone ##d and sequence ##d , and large strides have been made in understanding key points in the viral life cycle , including recent identification of a functional host cell receptor and solution of the three - dimensional structure of the viral attachment protein . much of this progress was possible only because a foundation of basic corona ##virus biology existed . the denis ##on laboratory has been at the forefront of the small group of investigators who have di ##sse ##cted the basic features of corona ##virus ##es . denis ##on has discovered critical mechanisms in the life cycle of the corona ##virus ##es and is a key figure in the effective and urgent application of this knowledge to sar ##s .  
background : corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) primarily cause enzo ##otic infections in birds and mammals but , in the last few decades , have shown to be capable of in ##fect ##ing humans as well . the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 and , more recently , middle - east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) has demonstrated the lethal ##ity of co ##vs when they cross the species barrier and in ##fect humans . a renewed interest in corona ##vira ##l research has led to the discovery of several novel human co ##vs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the co ##v life cycle . the co ##v envelope ( e ) protein is a small , integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus ’ life cycle , such as assembly , bud ##ding , envelope formation , and pathogen ##esis . recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology , its functions as an ion - channel ##ling vi ##rop ##orin , and its interactions with both other co ##v proteins and host cell proteins . main body : this review aims to establish the current knowledge on co ##v e by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge . it also compares e to other viral proteins of a similar nature to spec ##ulate the relevance of these new findings . good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research . conclusions : the most progress has been made on sar ##s - co ##v e , highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the co ##v life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogen ##esis . data shows that e is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that co ##vs lacking e make promising vaccine candidates . the high mortality rate of certain co ##vs , along with their ease of transmission , under ##pins the need for more research into co ##v molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti - corona ##vira ##l agents for both human co ##vs and enzo ##otic co ##vs .  
abstract knowledge of im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant regions in major viral antigen ##s is important for rational design of effective vaccines and diagnostic tests . although there have been many reports of such work done for sar ##s – co ##v , these were mainly focused on the immune responses of humans and mice . in this study , we aim to search for and compare im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant regions of the spike ( s ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins which are recognized by sera from different animal species , including mouse , rat , rabbit , ci ##vet , pig and horse . twelve overlapping rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein fragments were produced in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli , six each for the s and n proteins , which covered the entire coding region of the two proteins . using a membrane - strip based western b ##lot approach , the react ##ivity of each antigen fragment against a panel of animal sera was determined . im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant regions containing linear ep ##ito ##pes , which reacted with sera from all the species tested , were identified for both proteins . the s ##3 fragment ( aa 402 – 62 ##2 ) and the n ##4 fragment ( aa 220 – 336 ) were the most im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant among the six s and n fragments , respectively . antibodies raised against the s ##3 fragment were able to block the binding of a panel of s - specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ) to sar ##s – co ##v in elisa , further demonstrating the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nan ##ce of this region . based on these findings , one - step competition elisa ##s were established which were able to detect sar ##s – co ##v antibodies from human and at least seven different animal species . considering that a large number of animal species are known to be susceptible to sar ##s – co ##v , these ass ##ays will be a useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of sar ##s – co ##v and to mini ##mise the risk of animal - to - human transmission .  
summary the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans is now considered a pan ##de ##mic threat to the gulf region . since its discovery in 2012 , mer ##s - co ##v has reached 23 countries affecting about 1100 people , including a dozen children , and claiming over 400 lives . compared to sar ##s ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mer ##s - co ##v appears to kill more people ( 40 % versus 10 % ) , more quickly , and is especially more severe in those with pre - existing medical conditions . most mer ##s - co ##v cases ( > 85 % ) reported thus far have a history of residence in , or travel to the middle east . the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ology is characterised by slow and sustained transmission with occasional sparks . the dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel is the intermediate host of mer ##s - co ##v , but the transmission cycle is not fully understood . in this current review , we have briefly sum ##mar ##ised the latest information on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology , clinical features , diagnosis , treatment and prevention of mer ##s - co ##v especially highlighting the knowledge gaps in its transmission dynamics , diagnosis and prevent ##ive strategy .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection causes an acute respiratory illness and is associated with a high case fatal ##ity rate ; however , the pathogen ##esis of severe and fatal mer ##s - co ##v infection is unknown . we describe the his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic , im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemical , and ultra ##st ##ru ##ct ##ural findings from the first autopsy performed on a fatal case of mer ##s - co ##v in the world , which was related to a hospital outbreak in the united arab emirates in april 2014 . the main his ##top ##ath ##olo ##gic finding in the lungs was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage . evidence of chronic disease , including severe peripheral vascular disease , patch ##y cardiac fi ##bro ##sis , and he ##pati ##c ste ##ato ##sis , was noted in the other organs . double stain ##ing im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys that used anti – mer ##s - co ##v antibodies paired with im ##mun ##oh ##isto ##chemist ##ry for cy ##tok ##era ##tin and surf ##act ##ant identified p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and ep ##ith ##elial sync ##yt ##ial cells as important targets of mer ##s - co ##v antigen ; double im ##mun ##osta ##ining with dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 showed col ##oca ##lization in scattered p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and sync ##yt ##ial cells . no evidence of extra ##pu ##lm ##ona ##ry mer ##s - co ##v antigen ##s were detected , including the kidney . these results provide critical insights into the pathogen ##esis of mer ##s - co ##v in humans .  
abstract the primary targets for sar ##s - co ##v infection are the ep ##ith ##elial cells in the respiratory and int ##estinal tract . the ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace - 2 ) has been identified as a functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v . ace - 2 has been shown to be expressed at the apical domain of polar ##ized cal ##u - 3 cells . in this report , inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con 1 was examined for inhibitor ##y activities against sar ##s - co ##v on human lung car ##cino ##ma ep ##ith ##elial cal ##u - 3 cell line and the other three african green monkey kidney ep ##ith ##elial cell lines . inter ##fer ##on alfa ##con 1 demonstrated significant anti ##vira ##l activity in neutral red up ##take ass ##ay and virus yield reduction ass ##ay . the data might provide an important insight into the mechanism of pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v allowing further development of anti ##vira ##l the ##ra ##pies for treating sar ##s infections .  
the newly emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is becoming another “ sar ##s - like ” threat to the world . it has an extremely high death rate ( [UNK] % ) as there is no vaccine or efficient therapeutic ##s . the identification of the structures of both the mer ##s - co ##v receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) and its complex with dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , raises the hope of all ##ev ##iating this currently severe situation . in this review , we examined the molecular basis of the rb ##d - receptor interaction to outline why / how could we use mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d to develop vaccines and anti ##vira ##l drugs .  
summary background corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , first detected in china in december , 2019 . in january , 2020 , state , local , and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of co ##vid - 19 in illinois , usa . methods patients with confirmed co ##vid - 19 were defined as those with a positive sar ##s - co ##v - 2 test . contacts were people with exposure to a patient with co ##vid - 19 on or after the patient ' s sy ##mpt ##om onset date . contacts underwent active sy ##mpt ##om monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure . contacts who developed fever , cough , or short ##ness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . a convenience sample of 32 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic health - care personnel contacts were also tested . findings patient 1 — a woman in her 60s — returned from china in mid - january , 2020 . one week later , she was hospital ##ised with pneumonia and tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . her husband ( patient 2 ) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife . he was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . overall , 37 ##2 contacts of both cases were identified ; 34 ##7 underwent active sy ##mpt ##om monitoring , including 152 community contacts and 195 health - care personnel . of monitored contacts , 43 became persons under investigation , in addition to patient 2 . these 43 persons under investigation and all 32 as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic health - care personnel tested negative for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . interpretation person - to - person transmission of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 occurred between two people with prolonged , un ##pro ##tec ##ted exposure while patient 1 was sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic . despite active sy ##mpt ##om monitoring and testing of sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic and some as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic contacts , no further transmission was detected . funding none .  
abstract the outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has caused 209 deaths and 69 ##9 laboratory - confirmed cases in the arabian peninsula as of june 11 , 2014 . prepared ##ness efforts are hampered by considerable uncertainty about the nature and intensity of human - to - human transmission , with previous reproduction number estimates ranging from 0 . 4 to 1 . 5 . here we synth ##es ##ize ep ##ide ##mi ##ological data and transmission models for the mer ##s - co ##v outbreak during april – october 2013 to resolve uncertain ##ties in epidemic risk , while considering the impact of observation bias . we match the progression of mer ##s - co ##v cases in 2013 to a dynamic transmission model that incorporates community and hospital compartments , and distinguishes transmission by zoo ##not ##ic ( index ) cases and secondary cases . when observation bias is assumed to account for the fact that all reported zoo ##not ##ic cases are severe , but only [UNK] % of secondary cases are sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic , the average reproduction number of mer ##s - co ##v is estimated to be 0 . 45 ( 95 % ci : 0 . 29 – 0 . 61 ) . alternatively , if these ep ##ide ##mi ##ological observations are taken at face value , index cases are estimated to transmit substantially more effectively than secondary cases , ( r i = 0 . 84 ( 0 . 58 - 1 . 20 ) vs r s = 0 . 36 ( 0 . 24 – 0 . 51 ) ) . in both scenarios the relative contribution of hospital - based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission , indicating that disease control should be focused on hospitalized patients . adjusting previously published estimates for observation bias confirms a strong support for the average r < 1 in the first stage of the outbreak in 2013 and thus , trans ##mis ##sibility of secondary cases of mer ##s - co ##v remained well below the epidemic threshold . more information on the observation process is needed to clarify whether mer ##s - co ##v is intrinsic ##ally weakly trans ##missible between people or whether existing control measures have contributed meaningful ##ly to reducing the trans ##mis ##sibility of secondary cases . our results could help evaluate the progression of mer ##s - co ##v in recent months in response to changes in disease surveillance , control interventions , or viral adaptation .  
abstract the role of cell - mediated immunity in human sar ##s - co ##v infection is still not well understood . in this study , we found that memory t - cell responses against the spike ( s ) protein were persistent for more than 1 year after sar ##s - co ##v infection by detecting the production of if ##n - γ using elisa and eli ##sp ##ot ass ##ays . flow cy ##tom ##et ##ric analysis showed that both cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t cells were involved in cellular responses against sar ##s - co ##v infection . interesting ##ly , most of sar ##s - co ##v s - specific memory cd ##4 + t cells were central memory cells expressing cd ##45 ##ro + cc ##r ##7 + cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− . however , the majority of memory cd ##8 + t cells revealed effect ##or memory ph ##eno ##type expressing cd ##45 ##ro ##− cc ##r ##7 ##− cd ##6 ##2 ##l ##− . thus , our study provides the evidence that sar ##s - co ##v infection in humans can induce cellular immune response that is persistent for a long period of time . these data may have an important implication in the possibility of designing effective vaccine against sar ##s - co ##v infection , specifically in defining t - cell populations that are implicated in protective immunity .  
summary severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a new infectious disease that first emerged in guangdong province , china , in november , 2002 . a novel corona ##virus was later identified in patients with sar ##s . the detection of the virus in these patients , its absence in healthy controls or other patients with at ##yp ##ical pneumonia , and the reproduction of a similar disease in a relevant animal model fulfilled koch ' s post ##ulates for imp ##lica ##ting this corona ##virus as the causal agent of sar ##s . the full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the virus ' s identification . the rapid progress in the ae ##ti ##ology , the development of laboratory diagnostic tests , and the defining of routes of viral transmission were facilitated through a unique who - coordinated virtual network of laboratories , which shared information on a real - time basis through daily tel ##ec ##on ##ference ##s . subsequent studies have indicated that the sar ##s corona ##virus is of animal origin , that its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region , and that live - animal markets in southern china may have provided the animal - human inter ##pha ##se that allowed this precursor virus to adapt to human - human transmission . these findings under ##sco ##re the potential for the re - emergence of sar ##s and the need for laboratory tests for early diagnosis . however , the low viral load in the respiratory tract makes early diagnosis of sar ##s a diagnostic challenge , although improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods continue to be made .  
a high percentage ( up to 90 % ) of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s in the middle east as well as eastern and central africa have antibodies to middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . here we report com ##para ##bly high po ##sit ##ivity of mer ##s - co ##v antibodies in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s from northern mali . this extends the range of mer ##s - co ##v further west in africa than reported to date and caution ##s that mer ##s - co ##v should be considered in cases of severe respiratory disease in the region .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) infection causes lung failure characterized by at ##yp ##ical pneumonia . we previously showed that antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v spike domain 2 ( s ##2 ) in the patient sera can cross - react with human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells ; however , the auto ##ant ##igen is not yet identified . in this study , we performed pro ##te ##omic studies and identified several candidate auto ##ant ##igen ##s recognized by sar ##s patient sera in human lung type ii ep ##ith ##elial cell a ##54 ##9 . among the candidate proteins , annex ##in a2 , which was identified by mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry analysis and had the highest score by mascot data search , was further characterized and investigated for its role as an auto ##ant ##igen . by con ##fo ##cal microscopic observation , sar ##s patient sera and anti - s ##2 antibodies were co - localized on a ##54 ##9 cells and both of them were co - localized with anti - annex ##in a2 antibodies . anti - annex ##in a2 antibodies bound to pu ##rified s ##2 proteins , and anti - s ##2 bound to im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ated annex ##in a2 from a ##54 ##9 cell l ##ys ##ate in a dose - dependent manner . furthermore , an increased surface expression and raft - structure distribution of annex ##in a2 was present in a ##54 ##9 cells after stimulation with sar ##s - induced cy ##tok ##ines inter ##le ##uki ##n - 6 and inter ##fer ##on - γ . cy ##tok ##ine stimulation increased the binding capability of anti - s ##2 antibodies to human lung ep ##ith ##elial cells . together , the up ##re ##gul ##ated expression of annex ##in a2 by sar ##s - associated cy ##tok ##ines and the cross - react ##ivity of anti - sar ##s - co ##v s ##2 antibodies to annex ##in a2 may have implications in sar ##s disease pathogen ##esis .  
abstract to assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 sar ##s outbreak , we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric mor ##bid ##ity and psychological adaptation among nurses in sar ##s units and non - sar ##s units . nurse participants were from two sar ##s units ( regular sar ##s [ n = 44 ] and sar ##s ic ##u [ n = 26 ] ) and two non - sar ##s units ( ne ##uro ##logy [ n = 15 ] and cc ##u [ n = 17 ] ) . participants periodically self - evaluated their depression , anxiety , post - traumatic stress symptoms , sleep disturbance , attitude towards sar ##s and family support . results showed that depression ( 38 . 5 % vs . 3 . 1 % ) and ins ##om ##nia ( 37 % vs . 9 . 7 % ) were , respectively , greater in the sar ##s unit nurses than the non - sar ##s unit nurses . no difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post - traumatic stress symptoms ( 33 % vs . 18 . 7 % ) , yet , three unit subjects ( sar ##s ic ##u , sar ##s regular and ne ##uro ##logy ) had significantly higher rate than those in cc ##u ( 29 . 7 % vs . 11 . 8 % , respectively ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) . for the sar ##s unit nurses , significant reduction in mood ratings , ins ##om ##nia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of sar ##s at the end of the study ( all p < 0 . 001 ) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred . the adjustment of nurses in the more structured sar ##s ic ##u environment , where nurses care for even more severely ill patients , may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular sar ##s unit . occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to sar ##s patient care , previous mood disorder history , younger age and perceived negative feelings . positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress . in conclusion , the psychological impact on the caring staff ##s facing future bio - disaster will be minimize ##d with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment .  
abstract we investigated whether the surface - linked lip ##osomal peptide was applicable to a vaccine based on cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes ( ct ##ls ) against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . we first identified four h ##la - a * 02 ##01 - restricted ct ##l ep ##ito ##pes derived from sar ##s - co ##v using h ##la - a * 02 ##01 trans ##genic mice and rec ##om ##bina ##nt aden ##ov ##irus expressing predicted ep ##ito ##pes . these peptide ##s were coupled to the surface of lip ##oso ##mes , and in ##oc ##ulated into mice . two of the lip ##osomal peptide ##s were effective for peptide - specific ct ##l induction , and one of them was efficient for the clearance of va ##cci ##nia virus expressing ep ##ito ##pes of sar ##s - co ##v , suggesting that the surface - linked lip ##osomal peptide might offer an effective ct ##l - based vaccine against sar ##s .  
objectives : the outbreak of middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was one of the major events in south korea in 2015 . in particular , this study pays attention to formula ##ting a mathematical model for mer ##s transmission dynamics and est ##imating transmission rates . methods : incidence data of mer ##s - co ##v from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study . a mathematical model for mer ##s - co ##v transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions . results : using the estimates of the transmission rates , the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods . due to the super ##sp ##rea ##der , the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period ; however , the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions . conclusion : it turned out to be the intensive isolation and qu ##aran ##tine interventions that were the most critical factors that prevented the spread of the mer ##s outbreak . the results are expected to be useful to devi ##se more efficient intervention strategies in the future .  
dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 , cd ##26 ) , a type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ec ##top ##ept ##ida ##se , is the receptor for the middle eastern respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . mer ##s emerged in 2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease . a lack of autopsy studies from mer ##s fatalities has hind ##ered understanding of mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis . we investigated the spatial and cellular local ##ization of d ##pp ##4 to evaluate an association mer ##s clinical disease . d ##pp ##4 was rarely detected in the surface ep ##ith ##eli ##um from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways . d ##pp ##4 was also found in a subset of mono ##nu ##cle ##ar le ##uk ##ocytes and in ser ##ous cells of sub ##mu ##cos ##al glands . in the par ##en ##chy ##ma , d ##pp ##4 was found principally in type i and ii cells and al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges and was also detected in vascular end ##oth ##eli ##um ( e ##g , l ##ym ##pha ##tics ) and pl ##eur ##al me ##so ##the ##lia . patients with chronic lung disease , such as chronic ob ##st ##ru ##ctive pulmonary disease and cy ##stic fi ##bro ##sis , exhibited increased d ##pp ##4 im ##mun ##osta ##ining in al ##ve ##olar ep ##ith ##elia ( type i and ii cells ) and al ##ve ##olar macro ##pha ##ges with similar trends in reactive me ##so ##the ##lia . this finding suggests that pre ##ex ##ist ##ing pulmonary disease could increase mer ##s - co ##v receptor abundance and pre ##dis ##pose individuals to mer ##s mor ##bid ##ity and mortality , which is consistent with current clinical observations . we spec ##ulate that the prefer ##ential spatial local ##ization of d ##pp ##4 in al ##ve ##olar regions may explain why mer ##s is characterized by lower respiratory tract disease .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a new corona ##virus that emerged in 2012 , causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in man . its high mortality ( roughly 38 % ) has raised public fear worldwide , calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutic ##s to combat mer ##s - co ##v infection . on the basis of our previous work in development of peptide fusion inhibitors against hiv and sar ##s - co ##v , and the crystal structure of the six - helix - bundle core of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein , we identified a peptide derived from the mer ##s - co ##v s protein s ##2 subunit hr ##2 domain ( hr ##2 ##p ) with a potent inhibitor ##y activity against s - protein - mediated cell – cell fusion . here , we tested an hr ##2 ##p analogue with improved pharmaceutical properties , hr ##2 ##p - m2 , for its inhibitor ##y activity against mer ##s - co ##v infection in vitro and in vivo ( appendix ) . methods we assessed the anti - mer ##s - co ##v activities of hr ##2 ##p - m2 in vitro with pseudo ##type ##d mer ##s - co ##vs in cell culture and in vivo with live mer ##s - co ##vs in hd ##pp ##4 - trans ##genic mice . the activities of hr ##2 ##p - m2 to form six - helix bundles with hr ##1 peptide ##s and to block fusion core formation between hr ##1 and hr ##2 peptide ##s were studied using methods such as circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm , n - page , and f ##n - page . findings hr ##2 ##p - m2 was highly effective in blockade of cell – cell fusion mediated by mer ##s - co ##v s proteins and inhibition of infection by mer ##s pseudo ##virus ##es expressing mer ##s - co ##v s protein with or without mutation in the hr ##1 region , with ic ##50 ( the concentration causing 50 % inhibition ) less than 0 · 7 μ ##m . hr ##2 ##p - m2 bound to the hr ##1 peptide to form stable six - helix bundles and blocked fusion core formation between the hr ##1 and hr ##2 peptide ##s . intra ##nas ##al administration of hr ##2 ##p - m2 before viral challenge fully protected hd ##pp ##4 - trans ##genic mice ( n = 5 ) from mer ##s - co ##v infection , whereas all the un ##tre ##ated mice ( n = 5 ) died 8 days after viral challenge . interpretation our findings suggest that the hr ##2 ##p - m2 peptide merits further development as an effective and safe anti - mer ##s - co ##v drug , alone or in combination with other anti ##vira ##l drugs , to treat mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients and
abstract objective mer ##s - co ##v infection is uncommon ##ly identified among patients visiting healthcare facilities & we were vi ##gil ##ant in screening all patients entering our hospital to prevent cross infection among patients , visitors & healthcare providers and aiming to prevent potential outbreak ##s with mer ##s - co ##v infection . in spite of our efforts on practicing failure mode effect analysis for mer ##s - co ##v infection management we ended up having an outbreak with mer ##s - co ##v . based on our experience , we actively implemented policies , procedures & practices on early identification & appropriate isolation practices along with supplemental infection prevention & control measures for preventing future outbreak ##s at our healthcare facility . methods retrospective ##ly we analyzed our failure in preventing the outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v infection among our hospitalized patients by identifying the outbreak & actively intervening as a team to control the outbreak with the support of hospital higher management , administrators , quality improvement team , infection prevention & control team & the active support of all healthcare workers of the facility . results following the early identification of mer ##s - co ##v outbreak , we could successfully prevent large scale outbreak both in the hospital & the community . conclusion continuous implementation of infection prevention & control standards along with early clinical diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infections based on the case definition as laid out by the ministry of health will prevent infectious outbreak ##s at healthcare facilities .  
abstract the persistent public health threat of infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) highlights the need for an effective mer ##s - co ##v vaccine . previous studies have focused mainly on the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) on the spike protein of mer ##s - co ##v . here ##in , we investigated the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity and protective potential of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt n - terminal domain ( rn ##t ##d ) of spike proteins as a vaccine candidate . bal ##b / c mice va ##cci ##nated with 5 or 10 ##μ ##g of rn ##t ##d protein demonstrated a significant humor ##al immune response ( serum i ##gg and neutral ##izing activity ) . additionally , according to the enzyme - linked im ##mun ##os ##pot , intra ##cellular cy ##tok ##ine stain ##ing , and cy ##tom ##et ##ric bea ##d array ass ##ays , significant and functional t - cell immunity was induced by 10 ##μ ##g of the rn ##t ##d va ##cci ##nation with aluminum and cp ##g ad ##ju ##vant . furthermore , rn ##t ##d - im ##mun ##ized mice showed reduced lung abnormalities in a mer ##s - co ##v - challenge mouse model trans ##fect ##ed with an aden ##ov ##ira ##l vector expressing human d ##pp ##4 , showing protection consistent with that found with rr ##b ##d va ##cci ##nation . these data show that rn ##t ##d induced potent cellular immunity and antigen - specific neutral ##izing antibodies in mice and that it demonstrated protective capacity against a viral challenge , indicating that rn ##t ##d is a vaccine candidate against mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract background since the discovery of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 , diagnostic protocols were quickly published and deployed globally . objectives we set out to assess the quality of mer ##s - co ##v molecular diagnostic ##s worldwide . study design both sensitivity and specific ##ity were assessed using 12 samples containing different viral loads of mer ##s - co ##v or common corona ##virus ##es ( o ##c ##43 , 229 ##e , nl ##6 ##3 , hk ##u ##1 ) . results the panel was sent to more than 106 participants , of which 99 laboratories from 6 continents returned 189 panel results . scores ranged from 100 % ( 84 laboratories ) to 33 % ( 1 laboratory ) . 15 % of respondents reported quantitative results , 61 % semi - quantitative ( ct - values or time to po ##sit ##ivity ) and 24 % reported qu ##ali ##tative results . the major specific technique used was real - time rt - pc ##r using the who recommended targets up ##e , or ##f ##1 ##a and or ##f ##1 ##b . the evaluation confirmed that rt - pc ##rs targeting the or ##f ##1 ##b are less sensitive , and therefore not advised for primary diagnostic ##s . conclusions the first external quality assessment mer ##s - co ##v panel gives a good insight in molecular diagnostic techniques and their performances for sensitive and specific detection of mer ##s - co ##v rna globally . overall , all laboratories were capable of detecting mer ##s - co ##v with some differences in sensitivity . the observation that 8 % of laboratories reported false mer ##s - co ##v positive single ass ##ay results shows room for improvement , and the importance of using confirm ##atory targets .  
summary three years after its first discovery in jed ##dah saudi arabia , the novel zoo ##not ##ic pathogen of humans , the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) continues to be a major threat to global health security . 1 sporadic community acquired cases of mer ##s continue to be reported from the middle east . the recent nos ##oco ##mia ##l outbreak ##s in hospitals in seoul , korea and at the national guard hospital in ri ##yad ##h , saudi arabia indicate the epidemic potential of mer ##s - co ##v . currently there are no effective anti - mer ##s - co ##v anti - viral agents or therapeutic ##s and mer ##s is associated with a high mortality rate ( 40 % ) in hospital ##ised patients . a large proportion of mer ##s patients who die have a range of pulmonary pathology ranging from pneumonia to adult respiratory distress syndrome with multi - organ failure , compound ##ed by co - mor ##bid ##ities , reflecting a pre ##car ##ious balance of interactions between the host - immune system and mer ##s - co ##v . whilst we wait for new mer ##s - co ##v specific drugs , therapeutic ##s and vaccines to be developed , there is a need to advance a range of host - directed the ##ra ##pies . a range of hd ##ts are available , including commonly used drugs with good safety profiles , which could aug ##ment host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to mer ##s - co ##v , mod ##ulate excessive inflammation and reduce lung tissue destruction . we discuss the rational ##e and potential of using host - directed the ##ra ##pies for improving the poor treatment outcomes associated with mer ##s . carefully designed random ##ized controlled trials will be needed to determine whether hd ##ts could benefit patients with mer ##s . the rec ##urrent outbreak ##s of mer ##s - co ##v infections at hospitals in the middle east present unique opportunities to conduct random ##ized clinical trials . the time has come for a more coordinated global response to mer ##s and a multi ##dis ##ci ##plin ##ary global mer ##s - co ##v response group is required to take forward priority research agenda ##s .  
abstract the 3 ##c - like main protein ##ase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro , is widely considered to be a major drug target for the development of anti - sar ##s treatment . based on the chemical structure of a lead compound from a previous screening , we have designed and synthesized a number of non - pep ##ti ##dy ##l inhibitors , some of which have shown significantly improved inhibitor ##y activity against sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro with ic ##50 values of [UNK] . in the absence of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro crystal structures in complex with these synthetic inhibitors , molecular docking tools have been employed to study possible interactions between these inhibitors and sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro . the docking results suggest two major modes for the initial binding of these inhibitors to the active site of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro . they also establish a structural basis for the ‘ core design ’ of these inhibitors by showing that the 3 - ch ##lor ##op ##yr ##idi ##ne functions common to all of the present inhibitors tend to cluster in the s ##1 specific ##ity pocket . in addition , intrinsic flexibility in the s ##4 pocket allows for the accommodation of bulky groups such as benz ##ene rings , suggesting that this structural plastic ##ity can be further exploited for opt ##imi ##zing inhibitor – enzyme interactions that should promote a tighter binding mode . most importantly , our results provide the structural basis for rational design of wide - spectrum anti ##vira ##l drugs targeting the ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like cy ##stein ##e protein ##ase ##s from corona ##virus ##es and pic ##orn ##avi ##rus ##es .  
summary the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is associated with life - threatening severe illnesses and a mortality rate of approximately 35 % , particularly in patients with underlying como ##rb ##idi ##ties . a systematic analysis of 63 ##7 mer ##s - co ##v cases suggests that diabetes and hyper ##tension are equally prevalent in approximately 50 % of the patients . cardiac diseases are present in 30 % and obesity in 16 % of the cases . these conditions down - regulate the synthesis of pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines and imp ##air the host ' s innate and humor ##al immune systems . in conclusion , protection against mer ##s - co ##v and other respiratory infections can be improved if public health va ##cci ##nation strategies are tailored to target persons with chronic disorders .  
summary background since june , 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has , worldwide , caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths , with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from saudi arabia . in addition to confirming diagnosis , we generated the mer ##s - co ##v gen ##omic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on mer ##s - co ##v transmission , evolution , and origin . methods full genome deep sequencing was done on nuclei ##c acid extracted directly from pc ##r - confirmed clinical samples . viral genome ##s were obtained from 21 mer ##s cases of which 13 had 100 % , four 85 – 95 % , and four 30 – 50 % genome coverage . phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences , combined with nine published mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s , was done . findings three distinct mer ##s - co ##v gen ##otype ##s were identified in ri ##yad ##h . ph ##yl ##oge ##ographic analyses suggest the mer ##s - co ##v zoo ##not ##ic reservoir is geographically disperse . selection analysis of the mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the s protein . the genetic diversity in the al - has ##a cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction . interpretation we present the largest number of mer ##s - co ##v genome ##s ( 21 ) described so far . mer ##s - co ##v full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission . multiple introductions of mer ##s - co ##v are identified and suggest lower r ##0 values . transmission within saudi arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir , animal products , or movement of infected people . further definition of the exposure ##s responsible for the sporadic introductions of mer ##s - co ##v into human populations is urgently needed . funding saudi arabian ministry of health , well ##com ##e trust , european community , and national institute of health research university college london hospitals biomedical research centre .  
abstract we describe the anti ##vira ##l activity of plant le ##ct ##ins with specific ##ity for different g ##ly ##can structures against the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and the fe ##line infectious per ##ito ##ni ##tis virus ( fi ##p ##v ) in vitro . the sar ##s - co ##v emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans , and fi ##p ##v infection causes a chronic and often fatal per ##ito ##ni ##tis in cats . a unique collection of 33 plant le ##ct ##ins with different specific ##ities were evaluated . the plant le ##ct ##ins possessed marked anti ##vira ##l properties against both corona ##virus ##es with ec ##50 values in the lower micro ##gram / ml range ( middle nano ##mo ##lar range ) , being non - toxic ( cc ##50 ) at 50 – 100 ##μ ##g / ml . the strongest anti - corona ##virus activity was found predominantly among the mann ##ose - binding le ##ct ##ins . in addition , a number of gala ##ct ##ose - , n - ace ##ty ##lga ##la ##ct ##osa ##mine - , glucose - , and n - ace ##ty ##l ##gl ##uc ##osa ##mine - specific plant ag ##gl ##uti ##nine ##s exhibited anti - corona ##vira ##l activity . a significant correlation ( with an r - value of 0 . 70 ) between the ec ##50 values of the 10 mann ##ose - specific plant le ##ct ##ins effective against the two corona ##virus ##es was found . in contrast , little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of le ##ct ##ins . two targets of possible anti ##vira ##l intervention were identified in the replication cycle of sar ##s - co ##v . the first target is located early in the replication cycle , most probably viral attachment , and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle .  
abstract background middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is an emerging corona ##virus involved in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ar ##ds ) and rapid renal failure . hospital outbreak and nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission were reported , however , several issues remain on the viral ex ##cre ##tion course . objectives describe the kinetic ##s and pattern of viral ex ##cre ##tion in two infected patients . study design after the initial diagnosis , blood , urine , rec ##tal and respiratory samples were collected regularly , ali ##qu ##oted and stored at − ##80 ##° ##c . real - time reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ass ##ay targeted the up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a regions of the mer ##s - co ##v genome . results in patient 1 , who died of ref ##rac ##tory ar ##ds and renal failure , mer ##s - co ##v rna was detected in ph ##ary ##nge ##al and tr ##ache ##al sw ##ab ##s , as well blood samples and urine samples until the 30th day . rec ##tal sw ##ab ##s were negative . patient 2 also developed multiple - organ failure , but survived , with persist ##ing renal ins ##uf ##fi ##ciency ( cr ##ea ##tin ##ine clearance at 30 ##ml / min ) and persistent inter ##sti ##tial syndrome albeit we ##ane ##d off mechanical ventilation and no longer requiring oxygen . tr ##ache ##al aspirations were positive until the 33rd day , while nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab ##s were negative . all other biological samples were negative . discussion lower respiratory tract ex ##cre ##tion of mer ##s - co ##v could be observed for more than one month . the most severely ill patient presented an expression of the virus in blood and urine , consistent with a type - 1 inter ##fer ##on mediated im ##mun ##ological response impaired in patient 1 , but developed by patient 2 . these results suggest that infection control precautions must be adequately evaluated in clinical wards and laboratories exposed to mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the cellular receptor for human corona ##virus nl ##6 ##3 ( hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 ) , a group i corona ##virus , is ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme ##2 ( ace ##2 ) . ace ##2 is also the receptor for the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a group ii corona ##virus . here we describe the ability of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 to utilize a number of ace ##2 variants previously characterized as sar ##s - co ##v receptors . several ace ##2 variants that reduced sar ##s - co ##v s - protein association similarly reduced that of hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , whereas alteration of a number of solvent - exposed ace ##2 residues did not interfere with binding by either s protein . one notable exception is ace ##2 residue 354 , at the boundary of the sar ##s - co ##v binding site , whose alteration markedly inhibit ##ed utilization by the hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 but not sar ##s - co ##v s proteins . in addition , the sar ##s - co ##v s - protein receptor - binding domain inhibit ##ed entry mediated by the hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 s protein . these studies indicate that hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , like sar ##s - co ##v , associates region of human ace ##2 that includes a key loop formed by β - strands 4 and 5 .  
abstract the recent middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) outbreak poses a serious threat to public health . here , we sum ##mar ##ize recent advances in identifying human neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against mer ##s - co ##v , describe their mechanisms of action , and analyze their potential for treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
summary background since the first description of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , it has not been known how long patients shed the virus in respiratory secret ##ions . thus , we analyzed the available data on time to negative mer ##s - co ##v test in patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection and as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic positive contacts . methods data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the saudi arabian vi ##rol ##ogy reference laboratory in jed ##dah , kingdom of saudi arabia from september 1 , 2012 to september 31 , 2013 were recorded . a real - time rt - pc ##r test for mer ##s - co ##v was used . data were analyzed by origin of sample , sample type , and mer ##s - co ##v pc ##r test results . results twenty - six individuals ( 13 patients and 13 contacts ) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained . most samples from mer ##s - co ##v cases were tr ##ache ##al as ##pi ##rate / sp ##ut ##um ( p = 0 . 000 ##6 ) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat sw ##ab ##s ( p = 0 . 000 ##2 ) . kaplan – mei ##er curve analysis showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients . on day 12 , 30 % of contacts and 76 % of cases were still positive for mer ##s - co ##v by pc ##r . conclusions contacts cleared mer ##s - co ##v earlier than ill patients . this finding could be related to the types of sample as well as the types of patient studied . more ill patients with significant como ##rb ##idi ##ties shed the virus for a significantly longer time . the results of this study could have critical implications for infection control guidance and its application in healthcare facilities handling positive cases .  
recent study reported in this journal that the threats of continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 human corona ##virus ##es . 1 since its emergence in december 2019 , a “ seventh ” member of the family of 2019 human corona ##virus named “ sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ” was responsible for an outbreak of corona ##virus disease ( co ##vid - 19 ) in wu ##han , china . 2 as of february 23 , 2020 , china had reported more than 77 , 04 ##2 confirmed cases of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , with 2 , 44 ##5 fatalities and counting ( http : / / www . nh ##c . gov . cn ) . striking ##ly , sar ##s - co ##v - 2 had been transmitted rapidly in more than 29 countries to date ( https : / / www . who . int ) , including asia , europe , north america , africa , and oceania , posing serious concerns about its pan ##de ##mic potential . despite of drop ##let and contact transmissions of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , recent studies demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v - 2 might be transmitted via aero ##sol and fe ##cal – oral routes 3 ( figure 1 ) , which needs to be paid attention in particular .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an infectious condition caused by the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , a new member in the family corona ##vir ##idae . to evaluate the lung pathology in this life - threatening respiratory illness , we studied post ##mo ##rte ##m lung sections from 8 patients who died from sar ##s during the spring 2003 singapore outbreak . the predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage . the his ##tology varied according to duration of illness . cases that were 10 or fewer days in duration demonstrated acute phase diffuse al ##ve ##olar damage ( dad ) , airspace ed ##ema , and bro ##nch ##iol ##ar fi ##bri ##n . cases with a time course greater than 10 days showed organizing phase dad , type ii p ##ne ##um ##oc ##yte hyper ##pl ##asia , sq ##ua ##mous meta ##pl ##asia , multi ##nu ##cle ##ated giant cells , and acute bro ##nch ##op ##ne ##um ##onia . in acute dad , pan ##cy ##tok ##era ##tin stain ##ing was positive in h ##yal ##ine membranes along al ##ve ##olar walls and highlighted the absence of p ##ne ##um ##ocytes . multi ##nu ##cle ##ated cells were shown to be both type ii p ##ne ##um ##ocytes and macro ##pha ##ges by pan ##cy ##tok ##era ##tin , tt ##f - 1 , and cd ##6 ##8 stain ##ing . sar ##s - co ##v rna was identified by rt - pc ##r in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formal ##in - fixed , para ##ffin - embedded lung tissue including the one negative case in fresh tissue . understanding the pathology of dad in sar ##s patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies . further studies of the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s may reveal new insights into mechanisms of dad .  
abstract the human corona ##virus , associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , was identified and molecular ##ly characterized in 2003 . sequence analysis of the virus indicates that there is only 20 % amino acid ( aa ) identity with known corona ##virus ##es . previous studies indicate that protein – protein interactions amongst various corona ##virus proteins are critical for viral assembly . yet , little sequence homo ##logy between the newly identified sar ##s - co ##v and those previously studied corona ##virus ##es suggests that determination of protein – protein interaction and identification of amino acid sequences , responsible for such interaction in sar ##s - co ##v , are necessary for the el ##uc ##ida ##tion of the molecular mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v replication and rational ##ization of anti - sar ##s therapeutic intervention . in this study , we employed mammalian two - hybrid system to investigate possible interactions between sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) and the membrane ( m ) proteins . we found that interaction of the n and m proteins takes place in vivo and identified that a stretch of amino acids ( 168 – 208 ) in the n protein may be critical for such protein – protein interactions . importantly , the same region has been found to be required for multi ##mer ##ization of the n protein ( he et al . , 2004 ) suggesting this region may be crucial in maintaining correct conform ##ation of the n protein for self - interaction and interaction with the m protein .  
abstract the disease outbreak caused by middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is still ongoing in the middle east . over 1700 people have been infected since it was first reported in september 2012 . despite great efforts , licensed vaccines or therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v remain unavailable . the mer ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is an important viral antigen known to media ##te host - receptor binding and virus entry , as well as induce robust humor ##al and cell - mediated responses in humans during infection . in this review , we highlight the importance of the s protein in the mer ##s - co ##v life cycle , sum ##mar ##ize recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutic ##s based on the s protein , and discuss strategies that can be explored to develop new medical counter ##me ##as ##ures against mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract little information is available on persistent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . in this study , we established persistent infection of sar ##s - co ##v in the ve ##ro e ##6 cell line . acute infection of ve ##ro e ##6 with sar ##s - co ##v produced a l ##ytic infection with characteristic rounding cy ##top ##athic effects ( cp ##e ) and the production of a large number of infectious particles in the culture fluid within 3 days post - infection . upon subsequent cult ##uring of the remaining adhere ##nt cells , the cells gradually pro ##life ##rated and recovered normal morphology similar to that of the parental cells , and continued to produce large numbers of infectious viral particles during the observation period of 5 months . among a total of 87 cell clones obtained from the persistent ##ly infected ve ##ro e ##6 , only four cell clones ( named # 13 , # 18 , # 21 , and # 34 ) were positive for viral rna . clones # 13 , # 18 , and # 34 shifted to viral rna - negative during subsequent cultures , while # 21 continuously produced infectious particles at a high rate . the sar ##s - co ##v receptor , ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , was almost completely down regulated from the cell surface of persistent ##ly infected cells . western b ##lot analysis as well as electron microscopy indicated that the ratios of spike to nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein in clone # 21 as well as its parental persistent ##ly infected cells were lower than that in the cells in the acute phase of infection . these ve ##ro e ##6 cells persistent ##ly infected with sar ##s - co ##v may be useful for clarify ##ing the mechanism of the persistent infection and also for el ##uc ##ida ##ting the possible path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logic significance of such long - term maintenance of this virus .  
since december 2019 , china has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . the clinical features include fever , coughing , short ##ness of breath , and inflammatory lung in ##filtration . china rapidly listed sar ##s - co ##v - 2 - related pneumonia as a statutory infectious disease . to standard ##ize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease , an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infection is developed by peking union medical college hospital .  
the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v under ##sco ##res the threat of cross - species transmission events leading to outbreak ##s in humans . in this study , we examine the disease potential for sar ##s - like co ##vs currently circulating in chinese horseshoe bat populations . utilizing the sar ##s - co ##v infectious clone , we generated and characterized a chi ##meric virus expressing the spike of bat corona ##virus sh ##c ##01 ##4 in a mouse adapted sar ##s - co ##v backbone . the results indicate that group 2 ##b viruses encoding the sh ##c ##01 ##4 spike in a wild type backbone can efficiently utilize multiple ace ##2 receptor or ##th ##olo ##gs , replicate efficiently in primary human air ##way cells , and achieve in vitro ti ##ters equivalent to epidemic strains of sar ##s - co ##v . additionally , in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chi ##meric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogen ##esis . evaluation of available sar ##s - based immune - therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic mod ##ali ##ties revealed poor efficacy ; both mono ##cl ##onal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutral ##ize and protect from co ##vs utilizing the novel spike protein . importantly , based on these findings , we synthetic ##ally red ##eri ##ved an infectious full length sh ##c ##01 ##4 rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo . together , the work highlights a continued risk of sar ##s - co ##v re ##eme ##rgen ##ce from viruses currently circulating in bat populations .  
abstract corona ##virus envelope ( e ) protein is a small integral membrane protein with multi - functions in vi ##rion assembly , mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis and virus – host interaction . different corona ##virus e proteins share striking similarities in bio ##chemical properties and biological functions , but seem to adopt distinct membrane topology . in this report , we study the membrane topology of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##ores ##cent stain ##ing of cells differential ##ly per ##me ##abi ##lized with deter ##gent ##s and protein ##ase k protection ass ##ay . it was revealed that both the n - and c - term ##ini of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein are exposed to the cy ##top ##las ##mic side of the membranes ( nc ##yt ##oc ##cy ##to ) . in contrast , parallel experiments showed that the e protein from infectious bro ##nch ##itis virus ( ib ##v ) spanned the membranes once , with the n - terminus exposed lu ##mina ##lly and the c - terminus exposed cy ##top ##las ##mic ##ally ( ne ##x ##o ( lu ##m ) cc ##yt ##o ) . intriguing ##ly , a minor proportion of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein was found to be modified by n - linked g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion on as ##n 66 and inserted into the membranes once with the c - terminus exposed to the lu ##mina ##l side . the presence of two distinct membrane top ##ologies of the sar ##s - co ##v e protein may provide a useful clue to the pathogen ##esis of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the he ##pta ##d repeats 1 and 2 of sar ##s - co ##v spike , termed hr ##1 and hr ##2 , play critical roles in viral entry . moreover , hr ##1 and hr ##2 derived free peptide ##s are inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v entry . in this work we used circular di ##ch ##roi ##sm to show that hr ##2 helix formation is induced at ph 5 , the ph of the end ##oso ##me . in addition , we demonstrate that the hr ##2 helix is further stabilized at physiological ionic strengths . together , these observations provide new insight into the mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v entry and suggest that hr ##2 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention .  
abstract we synthesized on cell ##ulo ##se membranes 49 ##42 ten - amino - acid peptide ##s which included all of the sequences predicted for the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona virus . we probe ##d these membranes with four pairs of acute and con ##vale ##scent sera from recovered sar ##s cases . we correlated positively reacting peptide ##s with the in vitro sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing activity of the samples . we found that con ##vale ##scent sera with high neutral ##izing activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptide ##s on the membranes . this suggests that antibodies against the ep ##ito ##pes represented by these peptide ##s could be responsible for much of the sar ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing activity . the findings have implications for monitoring humor ##al responses to sar ##s - co ##v as well as for developing a successful sar ##s vaccine .  
a large number of sar ##s - related corona ##virus ##es ( sar ##sr - co ##v ) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of china . however , these bat sar ##sr - co ##vs show sequence differences from sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in different genes ( s , or ##f ##8 , or ##f ##3 , etc ) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct pro ##gen ##itor of sar ##s - co ##v . here ##in , we report the findings of our 5 - year surveillance of sar ##sr - co ##vs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in yunnan province , china . the full - length genome ##s of 11 newly discovered sar ##sr - co ##v strains , together with our previous findings , reveals that the sar ##sr - co ##vs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the s gene , or ##f ##3 and or ##f ##8 . importantly , strains with high genetic similarity to sar ##s - co ##v in the hyper ##var ##iable n - terminal domain ( nt ##d ) and receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of the s ##1 gene , the or ##f ##3 and or ##f ##8 region , respectively , were all discovered in this cave . in addition , we report the first discovery of bat sar ##sr - co ##vs highly similar to human sar ##s - co ##v in or ##f ##3 ##b and in the split or ##f ##8 ##a and 8 ##b . moreover , sar ##sr - co ##v strains from this cave were more closely related to sar ##s - co ##v in the non - structural protein genes or ##f ##1 ##a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere . rec ##om ##bina ##tion analysis shows evidence of frequent rec ##om ##bina ##tion events within the s gene and around the or ##f ##8 between these sar ##sr - co ##vs . we h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ize that the direct pro ##gen ##itor of sar ##s - co ##v may have originated after sequential rec ##om ##bina ##tion events between the precursor ##s of these sar ##sr - co ##vs . cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified sar ##sr - co ##vs with different s protein sequences are all able to use human ace ##2 as the receptor , further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and sar ##s - co ##v . this work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of sar ##s - co ##v and highlights the necessity of prepared ##ness for future emergence of sar ##s - like diseases .  
abstract the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has been identified as a novel corona ##virus , sar ##s - co ##v . the main protein ##ase of sar ##s - co ##v , 3 ##cl ##pro , is an attractive target for therapeutic ##s against sar ##s owing to its fundamental role in viral replication . we sought to identify novel inhibitors of 3 ##cl ##pro to advance the development of appropriate the ##ra ##pies in the treatment of sar ##s . 3 ##cl ##pro was clone ##d , expressed , and pu ##rified from the tor ##2 isolate . a que ##nched flu ##orescence resonance energy transfer ass ##ay was developed for 3 ##cl ##pro to screen the protein ##ase against 50 , 000 drug - like small molecules on a fully automated system . the primary screen identified 57 ##2 hits ; through a series of virtual and experimental filters , this number was reduced to five novel small molecules that show potent inhibitor ##y activity ( ic ##50 = 0 . 5 – 7 μ ##m ) toward sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro .  
middle east respiratory syndrome is the acute respiratory syndrome caused by beta ##cor ##ona ##virus mer ##s - co ##v . the first case of this disease was reported from saudi arabia in 2012 . this virus is lethal and is a close relative of a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , which is responsible for more than 3000 deaths in 2002 – 2003 . according to ministry of health , saudi arabia . the number of new cases is 45 ##7 in 2015 . ri ##yad ##h has the highest number of reports in comparison to the other cities . according to this report , males are more susceptible than female , especially after the age of 40 . because of the awareness and early diagnosis the incidence is falling gradually . the pre - existence of another disease like cancer or dia ##bet ##ic etc . boost ##s the infection . mer ##s is a zoo ##not ##ic disease and human to human transmission is low . the mer ##s - co ##v is a rna virus with protein envelope . on the outer surface , virus has spike like g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein which is responsible for the attachment and entrance inside host cells . there is no specific treatment for the mer ##s - co ##v till now , but drugs are in pipeline which bind with the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and inhibit its entrance host cells . mer ##s - co ##v and sar - co ##v are from the same genus , so it was thought that the drugs which inhibit the growth of sar ##s - co ##v can also inhibit the growth of mer ##s - co ##v but those drugs are not completely inhibit ##ing virus activity . until we don ’ t have proper structure and the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v , we should take precautions , especially the health care workers , camel owners and pilgrims during ha ##j ##j and um ##rah , because they are at a higher risk of getting infected .  
corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) are common human and animal pathogen ##s that can transmit zoo ##not ##ically and cause severe respiratory disease syndrome ##s . co ##v infection requires spike proteins , which bind viruses to host cell receptors and cat ##aly ##ze virus - cell membrane fusion . several co ##v strains have spike proteins with two receptor - binding domains , an s ##1 ##a that engages host si ##alic acids and an s ##1 ##b that recognizes host trans ##me ##mb ##rane proteins . as this bi ##valent binding may enable broad zoo ##not ##ic co ##v infection , we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages . focusing on two beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ##es , mu ##rine j ##hm - co ##v and human middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by si ##alic acids ; however , the trans ##me ##mb ##rane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection . these results favored a two - step process in which viruses first adhere to si ##alic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry . however , si ##alic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell - cell membrane fusion , without requiring protein receptors . this virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive s ##1 ##a mutations . overall , these findings reveal roles for si ##alic acids in virus - cell binding , viral spike protein - directed cell - cell fusion , and resultant spread of co ##v infections .  
sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths . there are currently no registered the ##ra ##pies for treating corona ##virus infections . because of time consuming process of new drug development , drug rep ##osition ##ing may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases . we systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 genes , compared them with proteins from other corona ##virus ##es , predicted their structures , and built 19 structures that could be done by homo ##logy modeling . by performing target - based virtual ligand screening , a total of 21 targets ( including two human targets ) were screened against compound libraries including zinc drug database and our own database of natural products . structure and screening results of important targets such as 3 - ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like pro ##tea ##se ( 3 ##cl ##pro ) , spike , rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) , and papa ##in like pro ##tea ##se ( pl ##pro ) were discussed in detail . in addition , a database of 78 commonly used anti - viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 was constructed . possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted . this study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 , new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies , and also possible new strategies for drug rep ##osition ##ing to treat sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections .  
abstract the huge rna genome of sar ##s corona ##virus comprises a number of open reading frames that code for a total of eight accessory proteins . although none of these are essential for virus replication , some appear to have a role in virus pathogen ##esis . notably , some sar ##s - co ##v accessory proteins have been shown to mod ##ulate the inter ##fer ##on signaling pathways and the production of pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines . the structural information on these proteins is also limited , with only two ( p ##7 ##a and p ##9 ##b ) having their structures determined by x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy . this review makes an attempt to sum ##mar ##ize the published knowledge on sar ##s - co ##v accessory proteins , with an emphasis on their involvement in virus – host interaction . the accessory proteins of other corona ##virus ##es are also briefly discussed . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es ” ( see introduction by hi ##lge ##n ##feld and pei ##ris ( 2013 ) ) .  
abstract in 2019 , a new corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) in ##fect ##ing humans has emerged in wu ##han , china . its genome has been sequence ##d and the gen ##omic information promptly released . despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - like co ##vs , we identified a peculiar fur ##in - like cleavage site in the spike protein of the 2019 - nc ##ov , lacking in the other sar ##s - like co ##vs . in this article , we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle , pathogen ##ici ##ty and its potential implication in the development of anti ##vira ##ls .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) have caused outbreak ##s of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century . the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2002 and was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with a fatal ##ity rate of 10 % before being contained in 2003 ( with additional cases reported in 2004 ) . the middle - east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in the arabian peninsula in 2012 and has caused rec ##urrent outbreak ##s in humans with a fatal ##ity rate of 35 % . sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v are zoo ##not ##ic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats / palm ci ##vet ##s and dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , respectively . no specific treatments or vaccines have been approved against any of the six human corona ##virus ##es , highlighting the need to investigate the principles governing viral entry and cross - species transmission as well as to prepare for zoo ##not ##ic outbreak ##s which are likely to occur due to the large reservoir of co ##vs found in mammals and birds . here , we review our understanding of the infection mechanism used by corona ##virus ##es derived from recent structural and bio ##chemical studies .  
abstract the immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is poorly understood . to define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in sar ##s , serum levels of cy ##tok ##ines , che ##mo ##kin ##es , im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins , complement and specific antibodies against sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were ass ##ay ##ed by enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ( elisa ) , and ph ##eno ##type ##s of peripheral l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes were analyzed by flow cy ##tom ##et ##ry in 95 sar ##s - infected patients . results showed that inter ##le ##uki ##n ( il ) - 10 and transforming growth factor β ( t ##gf - β ) were continuously up - regulated during the entirety of sar ##s . regulated on activation normally t cell - expressed and secret ##ed ( ran ##tes ) levels were decreased , while mono ##cy ##te che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t protein - 1 ( mc ##p - 1 ) was elevated in acute patients . im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lins and complement were elevated during the first month of sar ##s . both serum - positive rates and ti ##ters of specific i ##gm and i ##gg antibodies responding to sar ##s - co ##v peaked at days 41 – 60 from the onset of sar ##s . cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes decreased significantly in acute - phase . cd ##3 + cd ##8 + cd ##45 ##ro + t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes were decreased by 36 . 78 % in the con ##vale ##scent patients . conclusion : sar ##s - co ##v seemed to eli ##cit effective humor ##al immunity but inhibit ##ed cellular immunity , especially cd ##8 + memory t l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes over time . prolonged over ##pro ##duction of il - 10 and t ##gf - β may play an important role in the disease .  
summary the novel human corona ##virus 2019 - nc ##ov has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans . human - to - human transmissions have been described , probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces . in a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary corona ##virus ##es on ina ##ni ##mate surfaces it was shown that human corona ##virus ##es such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus or endemic human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ) can persist on ina ##ni ##mate surfaces like metal , glass or plastic for up to 9 days . some di ##sin ##fect ##ant agents effectively reduce corona ##virus in ##fect ##ivity within 1 minute such 62 % - 71 % ethanol , 0 . 5 % hydrogen per ##oxide or 0 . 1 % sodium h ##yp ##och ##lor ##ite . other compounds such as 0 . 05 % - 0 . 2 % benz ##al ##kon ##ium chloride or 0 . 02 % ch ##lor ##he ##xi ##dine dig ##lu ##cona ##te are less effective . an effective surface di ##sin ##fect ##ion may help to ensure an early containment and prevention of further viral spread .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been detected in a number of countries in the middle east and europe with an apparently high mortality rate . it is phylogenetic ##ally related to the sar ##s corona ##virus and has also been associated with severe respiratory illness as well as nos ##oco ##mia ##l transmission in healthcare settings . current international recommendations do not support any specific the ##ra ##pies ; however , there are a number of agents , which were used during the sar ##s epidemic of 2003 . it is possible that these might be active against the related mer ##s corona ##virus . we have reviewed the literature on the safety and efficacy of the ##ra ##pies used in patients with sar ##s with a view to their potential use in patients with mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract a capture enzyme - enhanced che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cence im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##y ( ec ##lia ) based on three specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies to detect the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in the serial serum samples from sar ##s patients was developed . the anti - sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg and the viral rna were also detected in the sera by elisa and rt - pc ##r , respectively . during the first 10 days after onset , anti - sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg , sar ##s - co ##v rna and the n protein were detected in 21 . 4 , 42 . 9 , and 90 % of the patients ’ sera , respectively . the detection rate of the n protein during days 11 – 15 of the disease was still significantly higher than those of anti - sar ##s - co ##v i ##gg and sar ##s - co ##v rna . the data demonstrated that detection of the n protein with the capture ec ##lia appears to be more useful than detection of other viral makers for rapid diagnosis of sar ##s in patients .  
abstract corona ##virus ##es possess a distinctive morphology , the name being derived from the outer fringe , or “ corona ” of embedded envelope protein . members of the family corona ##vir ##idae cause a broad spectrum of animal and human diseases . uniquely , replication of the rna genome proceeds through the generation of a nest ##ed set of viral mrna molecules . until 2003 , corona ##virus ##es attracted little interest beyond causing mild upper respiratory tract infections . this changed dramatically in 2003 with the zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##v and the more recent emergence of mer ##s - co ##v has confirmed the corona ##virus ##es as significant causes of severe respiratory disease .  
abstract the spike protein of sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important target for anti - sar ##s drug discovery . its s ##1 domain is responsible for receptor binding and sar ##s - co ##v entry into cells . in this study , we constructed a rational 3d model for s ##1 domain of sar ##s - co ##v spike protein by fold recognition and molecular modeling techniques . we found that there is a structure similarity between s ##1 protein and influenza virus ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e . our analyses suggest that the existing anti - influenza virus inhibitors and anti - ne ##uram ##ini ##das ##e antibody could be used as a starting point for designing anti - sar ##s drugs , vaccines and antibodies . interesting ##ly , our prediction for antibody is consistent with a recently experimental discovery of anti - sar ##s antibody .  
abstract based on molecular modeling techniques we constructed a rational 3d model of or ##f ##3 in sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . our studies suggest that the function of or ##f ##3 could be involved in fa ##d / nad binding according to its predicted structure and comparison with other structure neighbors . furthermore , we identified three pairs of non - canonical n – [UNK] interactions in the structure of or ##f ##3 , which can make contributions to the stability of protein structure . these results provide important clues for better understanding of sar ##s - co ##v or ##f ##3 and trying new therapeutic strategies .  
as of february 2020 , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) outbreak started in china in december 2019 has been spreading in many countries in the world . with the numbers of confirmed cases are increasing , information on the ep ##ide ##mi ##olo ##gic investigation and clinical manifestation have been accumulated . however , data on viral load kinetic ##s in confirmed cases are lacking . here , we present the viral load kinetic ##s of the first two confirmed patients with mild to moderate illnesses in korea in whom distinct viral load kinetic ##s are shown . this report suggests that viral load kinetic ##s of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may be different from that of previously reported other corona ##virus infections such as sar ##s - co ##v .  
the 2002 – 3 pan ##de ##mic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history ( 1 ) . an ongoing outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) ( 2 ) suggests that this group of viruses remains a major threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized . although bats have been suggested as the natural reservoirs of both viruses ( 3 – 5 ) , attempts to isolate the pro ##gen ##itor virus of sar ##s - co ##v from bats have been unsuccessful . diverse sar ##s - like corona ##virus ##es ( sl - co ##vs ) have now been reported from bats in china , europe and africa ( 5 – 8 ) , but none are considered a direct pro ##gen ##itor of sar ##s - co ##v because of their phylogenetic di ##spar ##ity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins ( s ) to use the sar ##s - co ##v cellular receptor molecule , the human ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ii ( ace ##2 ) ( 9 , 10 ) . here , we report whole genome sequences of two novel bat co ##vs from chinese horseshoe bats ( family : rhino ##lo ##phi ##dae ) in yunnan , china ; rs ##sh ##c ##01 ##4 and rs ##33 ##6 ##7 . these viruses are far more closely related to sar ##s - co ##v than any previously identified bat co ##vs , particularly in the receptor binding domain ( rd ##b ) of the s protein . most importantly , we report the first recorded isolation of a live sl - co ##v ( bat sl - co ##v - wi ##v ##1 ) from bat fe ##cal samples in ve ##ro e ##6 cells , which has typical corona ##virus morphology , 99 . 9 % sequence identity to rs ##33 ##6 ##7 and uses the ace ##2 ##s from human , ci ##vet and chinese horseshoe bat for cell entry . preliminary in vitro testing indicates that wi ##v ##1 also has a broad species tr ##op ##ism . our results provide the strongest evidence to date that chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of sar ##s - co ##v , and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat sl - co ##vs . they also highlight the importance of pathogen discovery programs targeting high - risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hot ##sp ##ots as a strategy for pan ##de ##mic prepared ##ness .  
abstract a remarkable collaborative effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) team at who resulted in discovery of the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome less than 2 months after the announcement of global alert . the development of a vaccine to prevent sar ##s should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit , as sar ##s is highly lethal and , if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission , is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health - care infrastructure is under ##dev ##elo ##ped and ep ##ide ##mi ##ological control measures are weak . the scientific community already learned many important lessons from hiv vaccine development ; these should be hee ##ded . for example , consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of sar ##s , as the newly emerge ##nt corona ##virus sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is proving to be variable and may be mu ##tat ##ing in response to immune pressure . sar ##s - specific research re ##age ##nts should also be collected and shared . these would include sar ##s peptide ##s , ad ##ju ##vant ##s , dna vaccine vectors and clinical grade viral vectors . rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a sar ##s vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the only way to go . this article reviews parallels between hiv and sar ##s and proposes an approach that would accelerate the development of a sar ##s vaccine .  
abstract corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection is usually detected by cellular sensors , which trigger the activation of the innate immune system . nevertheless , co ##vs have evolved viral proteins that target different signaling pathways to counter ##act innate immune responses . some co ##v proteins act as antagonist ##s of inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) by inhibit ##ing if ##n production or signaling , aspects that are briefly addressed in this review . after co ##v infection , potent cy ##tok ##ines relevant in controlling virus infections and pri ##ming adaptive immune responses are also generated . however , an un ##con ##tro ##lled induction of these pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory cy ##tok ##ines can lead to pathogen ##esis and disease severity as described for sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v . the cellular pathways mediated by inter ##fer ##on regulatory factor ( ir ##f ) - 3 and - 7 , act ##ivating transcription factor ( at ##f ) - 2 / jun , act ##iva ##tor protein ( ap ) - 1 , nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhance ##r of activated b cells ( n ##f - κ ##b ) , and nuclear factor of activated t cells ( n ##f - at ) , are the main drivers of the inflammatory response triggered after viral infections , with n ##f - κ ##b pathway the most frequently activated . key co ##v proteins involved in the regulation of these pathways and the pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory immune response are revisited in this manuscript . it has been shown that the envelope ( e ) protein plays a variable role in co ##v mor ##ph ##ogen ##esis , depending on the co ##v genus , being absolutely essential in some cases ( genus α co ##vs such as t ##ge ##v , and genus β co ##vs such as mer ##s - co ##v ) , but not in others ( genus β co ##vs such as m ##h ##v or sar ##s - co ##v ) . a comprehensive accumulation of data has shown that the relatively small e protein eli ##cit ##s a strong influence on the interaction of sar ##s - co ##v with the host . in fact , after infection with viruses in which this protein has been deleted , increased cellular stress and unfolded protein responses , ap ##op ##tosis , and augmented host immune responses were observed . in contrast , the presence of e protein activated a pathogen ##ic inflammatory response that may cause death in animal models and in humans . the modification or del ##eti ##on of different motifs within e protein , including the trans ##me ##mb ##rane domain that harbor ##s an ion channel activity , small sequences within the middle region of the car ##box ##y - terminus of e protein , and its most car ##box ##y - terminal end , which contains a pd ##z
corona ##virus ##es are the well - known cause of severe respiratory , enter ##ic and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man , mammals , fish , and av ##ian . the scientific interest on corona ##virus ##es increased after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) outbreak ##s in 2002 - 2003 followed by middle east respiratory syndrome co ##v ( mer ##s - co ##v ) . this decade ’ s first co ##v , named 2019 - nc ##ov , emerged from wu ##han , china , and declared as ‘ public health emergency of international concern ’ on january 30 ( th ) , 2020 by the world health organization ( who ) . as on february 4 , 2020 , 425 deaths reported in china only and one death outside china ( philippines ) . in a short span of time , the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries . the zoo ##not ##ic transmission ( animal - to - human ) is suspected as the route of disease origin . the genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019 - nc ##ov though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus . the ongoing nc ##ov outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spill ##over zoo ##nos ##es as well . the successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostic ##s and effective vaccines helping in combat ##ing the spread of the virus to newer areas .  
abstract although the recent sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) that appeared in 2002 has now been contained , the possibility of re - emergence of sar ##s - co ##v remains . due to the threat of re - emergence , the overall fatal ##ity rate of [UNK] % , and the rapid di ##sper ##sion of the virus via international travel , viable vaccine candidates providing protection from sar ##s are clearly needed . we developed an at ##ten ##uated vs ##v rec ##om ##bina ##nt ( vs ##v - s ) expressing the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike ( s ) protein . in cells infected with this rec ##om ##bina ##nt , s protein was synthesized , g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted at approximately 17 as ##n residues , and transported via the go ##l ##gi to the cell surface . mice va ##cci ##nated with vs ##v - s developed sar ##s - neutral ##izing antibody and were able to control a challenge with sar ##s - co ##v performed at 1 month or 4 months after a single va ##cci ##nation . we also demonstrated , by passive antibody transfer , that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient for controlling sar ##s - co ##v infection . a vs ##v - vector ##ed sar ##s vaccine could have significant advantages over other sar ##s vaccine candidates described to date .  
summary background the new middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection shares many clinical , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological , and vi ##rol ##ogical similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v . we aimed to estimate virus trans ##mis ##sibility and the epidemic potential of mer ##s - co ##v , and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prep ##and ##emi ##c sar ##s . methods we retrieved data for mer ##s - co ##v clusters from the who summary and subsequent reports , and published descriptions of cases , and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory - confirmed cases of mer ##s - co ##v reported as of june 21 , 2013 , excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks . to assess the inter ##hum ##an trans ##mis ##sibility of mer ##s - co ##v , we used bay ##esian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number ( r ##0 ) and compared it to that of prep ##and ##emi ##c sar ##s . we considered two scenarios , depending on the interpretation of the mer ##s - co ##v cluster - size data . results with our most pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic scenario ( scenario 2 ) , we estimated mer ##s - co ##v r ##0 to be 0 · 69 ( 95 % ci 0 · 50 – 0 · 92 ) ; by contrast , the r ##0 for prep ##and ##emi ##c sar ##s - co ##v was 0 · 80 ( 0 · 54 – 1 · 13 ) . our optimistic scenario ( scenario 1 ) yielded a mer ##s - co ##v r ##0 of 0 · 60 ( 0 · 42 – 0 · 80 ) . because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures , further mer ##s - co ##v transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster , but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient . hence , we calculated that , under scenario 2 , eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5 % or higher chance that the revised mer ##s - co ##v r ##0 would exceed 1 — ie , that mer ##s - co ##v might have pan ##de ##mic potential . interpretation our analysis suggests that mer ##s - co ##v does not yet have pan ##de ##mic potential . we recommend enhanced surveillance , active contact tracing , and vigorous searches for the mer ##s - co ##v animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings . funding age ##nce nationale de la rec ##her ##che ( lab ##ex int ##eg ##rative biology of emerging infectious diseases ) , and the european community ' s seventh framework programme project pre ##de ##mics .  
abstract programmed rib ##osomal frames ##hi ##fting is an essential mechanism used for the expression of or ##f ##1 ##b in corona ##virus ##es . comparative analysis of the frames ##hi ##ft region reveals a universal shift site u _ u ##ua _ aa ##c , followed by a predicted downstream rna structure in the form of either a pseudo ##k ##not or kissing stem loops . frames ##hi ##fting in sar ##s - co ##v has been characterized in culture ##d mammalian cells using a dual lucifer ##ase reporter system and mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry . mu ##tage ##nic analysis of the sar ##s - co ##v shift site and mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry of an affinity tagged frames ##hi ##ft product confirmed tandem tr ##na slip ##page on the sequence u _ u ##ua _ aa ##c . analysis of the downstream pseudo ##k ##not st ##im ##ulator of frames ##hi ##fting in sar ##s - co ##v shows that a proposed rna secondary structure in loop ii and two un ##pa ##ired nu ##cle ##otide ##s at the stem i – stem ii junction in sar ##s - co ##v are important for frames ##hi ##ft stimulation . these results demonstrate key sequences required for efficient frames ##hi ##fting , and the utility of mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry to study rib ##osomal frames ##hi ##fting .  
the beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of co ##vid - 19 outbreak caused by a novel corona ##virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) . there is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread . in this study , we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 by considering the high genetic similarity between sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and sar ##s - co ##v , which caused the outbreak in 2003 , and lever ##aging existing im ##mun ##ological studies of sar ##s - co ##v . by screening the experimental ##ly - determined sar ##s - co ##v - derived b cell and t cell ep ##ito ##pes in the im ##mun ##ogenic structural proteins of sar ##s - co ##v , we identified a set of b cell and t cell ep ##ito ##pes derived from the spike ( s ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins that map identical ##ly to sar ##s - co ##v - 2 proteins . as no mutation has been observed in these identified ep ##ito ##pes among the 120 available sar ##s - co ##v - 2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) , immune targeting of these ep ##ito ##pes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus . for the t cell ep ##ito ##pes , we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated m ##hc all ##eles and proposed a set of ep ##ito ##pes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally , as well as in china . our findings provide a screened set of ep ##ito ##pes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 .  
abstract ve ##ro e ##6 cells are commonly used for in vitro studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and for anti ##vira ##l evaluation purposes . a better understanding of the sar ##s - co ##v growth kinetic ##s in ve ##ro e ##6 cells is crucial to help el ##uc ##ida ##te the mechanism of anti ##vira ##l activity of selective anti ##vira ##l agents . in this study , the growth kinetic ##s of sar ##s - co ##v in ve ##ro e ##6 cells were studied by quan ##ti ##tation of intra - and extra ##cellular viral rna load as well as extra ##cellular virus yield at different time points post - infection . at 12 ##h post - infection , the intra ##cellular viral rna load was 3 ##× ##10 ##2 - fold higher than at the time of infection , and the extra ##cellular viral rna load was increased with a factor of 2 ##× ##10 ##3 . intra ##cellular viral rna levels started to rise at 6 ##h post - infection . one hour later ( at 7 ##h post - infection ) , the levels of extra ##cellular sar ##s - co ##v rna also began to rise . this was co ##rro ##bor ##ated by the fact that infectious pro ##geny sar ##s - co ##v also first appeared in the super ##nat ##ant between 6 and 7 ##h post - infection . at 12 ##h post - infection , sar ##s - co ##v reached ti ##ters in the super ##nat ##ant of 5 . 2 ##× ##10 ##3 cc ##id ##50 / ml .  
abstract sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is a newly emerged , highly pathogen ##ic agent that caused over 800 ##0 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between november 2002 and september 2003 . while direct person - to - person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases , other modes have not been ruled out . sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rae ##mia does not seem to reach high ti ##tres , however , it has to be excluded that virus transmission may occur via blood trans ##fusion or application of therapeutic plasma products , e . g . fresh - frozen plasma or single components derived thereof . manufacturing processes of all plasma derivatives are required to comprise dedicated virus ina ##ct ##ivation / removal steps . treatment with a mixture of solvent and deter ##gent ( sd ) has successfully been applied to ina ##ct ##ivate the most members of the trans ##fusion - relevant viruses without affecting therapeutic properties of the products . the sd treatment ir ##re ##vers ##ibly disrupt ##s the lip ##id envelope of viruses such as hiv , h ##b ##v , hc ##v , h ##g ##v and cm ##v . in this study we evaluated the manufacturing process of an im ##mun ##og ##lo ##bu ##lin preparation ( oct ##aga ##m , manufactured by oct ##ap ##har ##ma ph ##arm ##az ##eu ##ti ##ka pro ##duk ##tions ##ges . m . b . h . , vienna , austria ) for its capacity to ina ##ct ##ivate the sar ##s - co ##v . our results demonstrate that sar ##s - co ##v was completely inactivated below the limit of detection . this was found to occur within 1 ##min of sd treatment .  
abstract excessive immune response is believed to play a role in the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . in ##hom ##ogen ##eous spread of sar ##s led one to think of an asian genetic pre ##dis ##position and contribution of human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen ( h ##la ) to the disease su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . however , past case - control studies showed inconsistent results . in viet nam , of 62 patients with sar ##s , 44 participated in the present study together with 103 individuals who had contact with sar ##s patients and 50 without contact history . h ##la - dr ##b ##1 * 12 was more frequently shown in sar ##s patients than in controls ( corrected p = 0 . 04 ##2 ) . h ##la - dr ##b ##1 * 120 ##2 , the predominant all ##ele in the vietnamese population showed the strongest association with sar ##s in a dominant model ( corrected p = 0 . 00 ##65 and 0 . 00 ##52 , depending on the controls to be compared ) . our results and accumulated data on h ##la in the asian populations would help in the understanding of associations with emerging infectious diseases .  
summary middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was reported from a number of countries in the middle east and europe with a reported high mortality rate . mer ##s - co ##v was initially isolated from a patient from bis ##ha , saudi arabia . a recent outbreak of mer ##s - co ##v infection was described in a healthcare facility . although , the recent publications on this topic had shed light on the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the disease , many questions remain to be answered .  
summary enhanced surveillance systems have been implemented recently in many countries in order to rapidly detect and investigate any possible cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection among travellers returning from the middle east , including notably ha ##j ##j pilgrims . according to the available surveillance data , only a few sporadic travel - associated mer ##s - co ##v cases have been reported outside the arabian peninsula so far , mainly in europe , north africa , and asia . these have resulted in no cases , or limited numbers of secondary cases except in korea . the vast majority of viral respiratory infections in pilgrims returning home have been due to seasonal influenza viruses , rhino ##virus ##es , and other known corona ##virus ##es distinct from the mer ##s corona ##virus . influenza va ##cci ##nation should be a priority for all ha ##j ##j pilgrims , as recommended by experts .  
abstract lip ##id raft ##s are involved in the life cycle of many viruses . in this study , we showed that lip ##id raft ##s also play an important role in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) . cho ##les ##terol de ##ple ##tion by pre ##tre ##at ##ment of ve ##ro e ##6 cells with methyl - β - cy ##cl ##ode ##xt ##rin ( m ##β ##cd ) inhibit ##ed the production of sar ##s - co ##v particles released from the infected cells . this inhibition was prevented by addition of cho ##les ##terol to the culture medium , indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cho ##les ##terol in the cell membrane . in contrast , cho ##les ##terol de ##ple ##tion at the post - entry stage ( 3 ##h post - infection ) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release . northern b ##lot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mrna ##s were significantly affected by pre ##tre ##at ##ment with m ##β ##cd , but not by treatment at 3 ##h post - infection . interesting ##ly , no apparent evidence for col ##oca ##lization of ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme 2 with lip ##id raft ##s in the membrane of ve ##ro e ##6 cells was obtained . these results suggest that lip ##id raft ##s could contribute to sar ##s - co ##v infection in the early replication process in ve ##ro e ##6 cells .  
abstract human corona ##virus ##es ( hc ##ov ##s ) , including hc ##ov - 229 ##e , hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 , hc ##ov - nl ##6 ##3 , and hc ##ov - hk ##u ##1 , are traditionally known to cause symptoms of common cold with only moderate clinical impact . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) and middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , on the other hand , have strike humans in the past two decades as highly fatal human pathogen ##s leading to considerable mortality and economic loss . this article sum ##mar ##ies the updates on the structure , genome organization , replication and clinical features of human corona ##virus ##es . recent studies also shed light upon the zoo ##not ##ic origin of emerging human pathogen ##s including sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v , providing insight for future surveillance and intervention .  
abstract the 90 ##k ##da rib ##osomal s ##6 kinase ##s ( p ##90 ##rsk ##s ) are a family of broadly expressed ser ##ine / th ##re ##oni ##ne kinase ##s with two kinase domains activated by extra ##cellular signal - regulated protein kinase in response to many growth factors . our recent study demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - corona ##virus ( co ##v ) infection of monkey kidney ve ##ro e ##6 cells induce ##s ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation and de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of signaling pathways , resulting in ap ##op ##tosis . in the present study , we investigated the ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation status of p ##90 ##rsk , which is a well - known substrate of these signaling pathways , in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . ve ##ro e ##6 mainly expressed p ##90 ##rsk ##1 and showed weak expression of p ##90 ##rsk ##2 . in the absence of viral infection , ser ##22 ##1 in the n - terminal kinase domain was ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated con ##sti ##tu ##tively , whereas both th ##r ##57 ##3 in the c - terminal kinase domain and ser ##38 ##0 between the two kinase domains were not ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in con ##fl ##uen ##t cells . ser ##38 ##0 , which has been reported to be involved in auto ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation by activation of the c - terminal kinase domain , was ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated in con ##fl ##uen ##t sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells , and this ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation was inhibit ##ed by sb ##20 ##35 ##80 , which is an inhibitor of p ##38 mit ##ogen - activated protein kinase ##s ( map ##k ) . ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of th ##r ##57 ##3 was not up ##re ##gul ##ated in sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells . thus , in virus - infected cells , ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of th ##r ##57 ##3 was not necessary to induce ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of ser ##38 ##0 . on the other hand , both th ##r ##57 ##3 and ser ##38 ##0 were ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated by treatment with ep ##ider ##mal growth factor ( e ##gf ) in the absence of p ##38 map ##k activation . ser ##22 ##0 was con ##sti ##tu ##tively ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lated despite infection . these results indicated that ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation status of p ##90 ##rsk by sar ##s - co ##v infection is different from that by stimulation of e ##gf . this is the first detailed report regarding regulation of p ##90 ##rsk ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation by virus infection .  
abstract the recent outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection has led to more than 800 laboratory - confirmed mer ##s cases with a high case fatal ##ity rate ( [UNK] % ) , posing a serious threat to global public health and calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic strategies to treat and prevent mer ##s - co ##v infection . here we discuss the most recent studies on the structure of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein and its role in virus binding and entry , and the development of mer ##s - co ##v entry / fusion inhibitors targeting the s ##1 subunit , particularly the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) , and the s ##2 subunit , especially the hr ##1 region , of the mer ##s - co ##v spike protein . we then look ahead to future applications of these viral entry / fusion inhibitors , either alone or in combination with specific and non ##sp ##ec ##ific mer ##s - co ##v replication inhibitors , for the treatment and prevention of mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) has been described in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) . the virus , sar ##s - co ##v , differs from the previously described human corona ##virus ##es , 229 ##e and o ##c ##43 . 229 ##e was previously shown to productive ##ly in ##fect human mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges , whereas o ##c ##43 poorly infected the cells . in this study , we examined whether sar ##s - co ##v could productive ##ly in ##fect pu ##rified mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges ( pm ) derived from human donor cells . unlike 229 ##e - infected cells , which produced viral ti ##ters of 103 . 5 to 106 tc ##id ##50 / ml , sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##d poorly in pm , producing ti ##ters of 101 . 75 to 102 tc ##id ##50 / ml . this finding was similar to results reported for o ##c ##43 - infected cells , with ti ##ters ranging from 101 . 2 to 102 . 7 tc ##id ##50 / ml . of interest , sar ##s - co ##v proteins were detected only in pm that did not produce significant amounts of inter ##fer ##on ( if ##n ) - α , and in one such case , preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that sar ##s - co ##v - like particles could enter the cells , possibly via ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis . these results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v , like human co ##v o ##c ##43 , poorly in ##fect ##s human pm , and production of if ##n - α by these cells further limits the infection . given the importance of mono ##cytes / macro ##pha ##ges to the immune response , it is possible that their infection by sar ##s - co ##v and alteration of this infection by if ##n - α may be important to the course of the infection in humans .  
abstract the availability of mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) specific for the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is important for the development of both diagnostic tools and treatment of infection . a molecular characterization of nine mono ##cl ##onal antibodies raised in immune mice , using highly pu ##rified , inactivated sar ##s - co ##v as the in ##oc ##ulating antigen , is presented in this report . these antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets , and six of them are able to effectively neutral ##ize sar ##s - co ##v in vitro , including one with a neutral ##izing ti ##tre of 0 . 07 ##5 ##n ##m . a phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mab ##s share considerable homo ##logy . the majority of the heavy chains belong to a single i ##g ge ##rm ##line v - gene family , while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences . these analyses demonstrate that neutral ##ization ability can be correlated with specific mu ##rine v ##h - gene all ##eles . for instance , one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the v ##h chains of the neutral ##izing mab ##s , particularly in cd ##r - 1 and cd ##r - 2 . the results suggest that optimization of mu ##rine mab ##s for neutral ##ization of sar ##s - co ##v infection will likely be possible , and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) has drawn enormous attention and caused fear worldwide since early 2003 . the disease appears to be under control now ; however , the possible return of sar ##s must be emphasized . although many clinical experiments have been reported , the treatment of sar ##s is largely an ##ec ##dot ##al , and so far no treatment consensus has been reached . we sum ##mar ##ize 14 clinical reports and attempt to assess the effectiveness of various treatment regime ##ns . a combination treatment of ste ##roids and rib ##avi ##rin was widely used empirical ##ly from the outset of the epidemic . in general , the use of ste ##roids for sar ##s seemed beneficial , but the optimal timing , dos ##age , and duration of treatment have not yet been determined . on the other hand , rib ##avi ##rin administration apparently reduced neither the rate of intra ##tra ##che ##al int ##uba ##tion nor that of mortality . moreover , significant toxicity , such as hem ##ol ##ytic an ##emia , has been attributed to rib ##avi ##rin . a few preliminary trials and in vitro data suggest the possibility of treating sar ##s with inter ##fer ##on . other agents , including the hiv pro ##tea ##se inhibitor g ##ly ##cy ##rr ##hi ##zin and con ##vale ##scent plasma , remain to be evaluated .  
introduction successful respiratory viruses have developed means to overcome specific if ##n and is ##g effect ##or functions . yet globally , is ##gs as a class have broad functions and imp ##ede both pathogen ##esis and viral replication . therefore , highly successful respiratory viruses including sar ##s - co ##v and influenza a virus ( ia ##v ) , likely attempt to short - circuit global is ##g induction , potentially through diverse mechanisms . methods in this work , global rna ( micro ##ar ##ray ) and pro ##te ##omics data ( mass spec ##trom ##et ##ry ) are utilized to compare and contrast is ##g control strategies employed by ia ##v h ##5 ##n ##1 , h ##1 ##n ##1 2009 , and sar ##s - co ##v . cal ##u - 3 cells , a human lung ep ##ith ##elial cell line , are treated with type i if ##n to define a consensus list of if ##n responsive genes . these genes are then examined in the context of virus infections to evaluate the global is ##g response . results sar ##s - co ##v and ia ##v h ##5 ##n ##1 utilize contrasting approaches to interfere with the global host is ##g response . whereas ia ##v h ##5 ##n ##1 actively manipulate ##s the is ##g response with up and down regulation of is ##g transcript ##s , sar ##s - co ##v successfully limits is ##g induction until late times during infection . global pro ##te ##omic analysis confirms the absence of is ##g proteins following h ##5 ##n ##1 infection ; in contrast , sar ##s - co ##v induce ##s increased abundance of several is ##g proteins , but not until after peak viral ti ##ters have been achieved . together , the data illustrate that these two vi ##ru ##lent respiratory viruses control the global is ##g response . further examination reveals is ##g manipulation is absent in a less vi ##ru ##lent ia ##v strain . h ##1 ##n ##1 2009 infection results in robust is ##g transcript expression with minimal down regulation . similarly , pro ##te ##omics analysis finds increased abundance of is ##g proteins absent in h ##5 ##n ##1 infection . transcription ##al factor analysis found no direct ant ##ago ##nism ; however , tr ##un ##cation of the c - terminal portion of ns ##1 ab ##lated is ##g down regulation in h ##5 ##n ##1 infections . meta - analysis finds a similar ab ##lation is observed in a ##54 ##9 cells infected h ##1 ##n ##1 1918 when ns ##1 is manipulated . together , the data strongly imp ##lica ##te a role for ns ##1 in media ##ting control of the entire global is ##g response following vi ##ru ##lent ia ##v infections . for sar ##s - co ##v , the delayed is ##g induction is maintained in both mutant and precursor viruses . do ##rf ##6 , a sar ##s - co ##v mutant lacking a major if
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been recognized as a highly pathogen ##ic virus to humans that in ##fect ##s the respiratory tract and is associated with high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . studies in animal models suggest that mer ##s - co ##v infection induce ##s a strong inflammatory response , which may be related to the severity of disease . data showing the cy ##tok ##ine profiles in humans during the acute phase of mer ##s - co ##v infection are limited . in this study , we have analyzed the profile of cy ##tok ##ine responses in plasma samples from patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infections ( n = 7 ) compared to healthy controls ( n = 13 ) . the cy ##tok ##ine profiles , including t help ##er ( th ) 1 , th ##2 and th ##17 responses , were analyzed using cy ##tom ##et ##ric bea ##d array ( cb ##a ) . a prominent pro - inflammatory th ##1 and th ##17 response was clearly seen in patients with mer ##s - co ##v infection , with markedly increased concentrations of if ##n - γ , tn ##f - α , il - 15 and il - 17 compared to controls . il - 12 expression levels showed no difference between patients with mer ##s - co ##v infection and the healthy controls despite the significantly increased levels of if ##n - α ##2 and if ##n - γ ( p < . 01 ) . no changes were observed in the levels of il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 13 , and t ##gf - α ( p > . 05 ) . our results demonstrate a marked pro - inflammatory cy ##tok ##ine response during the acute phase of mer ##s - co ##v infection in humans .  
abstract mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against the urban ##i strain of the sar ##s - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) were developed and characterized for react ##ivity to sar ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v s , n , m , and e proteins using enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oa ##bs ##or ##ben ##t ( elisa ) , radio ##im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation , im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence , western b ##lot and micro ##ne ##ut ##ral ##ization ass ##ays . twenty - six mab ##s were reactive to sar ##s - co ##v by elisa , and nine were chosen for detailed characterization . five mab ##s reacted against the s protein , two against the m protein , and one each against the n and e proteins . two of five s protein mab ##s neutral ##ized sar ##s - co ##v infection of ve ##ro e ##6 cells and reacted to an ep ##ito ##pe within amino acids 490 – 510 in the s protein . while two of the three non - neutral ##izing antibodies recognized at second ep ##ito ##pe within amino acids 270 – 350 . the mab ##s characterized should prove useful for developing sar ##s - co ##v diagnostic ass ##ays and for studying the biology of infection and pathogen ##esis of disease .

abstract in 2012 in jordan , infection by a novel corona ##virus ( co ##v ) caused the first known cases of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) . mer ##s - co ##v sequences have since been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzo ##otic among dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s across the arabian peninsula and in parts of africa . the majority of human cases have occurred in the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) . in humans , the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent , mer ##s - co ##v , has been detected in severe , mild and influenza - like illness and in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease . mer ##s is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever , cough , breathing difficulties , pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome , multi ##org ##an failure and death among more than a third of those infected . severe disease is usually found in older males and como ##rb ##idi ##ties are frequently present in cases of mer ##s . compared to sar ##s , mer ##s progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury , is more often observed as severe disease in patients with underlying illnesses and is more often fatal . mer ##s - co ##v has a broader tr ##op ##ism than sar ##s - co ##v , rapidly triggers cellular damage , employs a different receptor and induce ##s a delayed pro ##in ##fl ##am ##mat ##ory response in cells . most human cases have been linked to laps ##es in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings , with a fifth of virus detection ##s reported among healthcare workers . this review sets out what is currently known about mer ##s and the mer ##s - co ##v , sum ##mar ##ises the new phenomenon of crowd - sourced ep ##ide ##mi ##ology and lists some of the many questions that remain una ##ns ##wer ##ed , nearly three years after the first reported case .  
abstract to confirm an infection with the new corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) diagnostic ass ##ays for detection of sar ##s - co ##v specific antibody are necessary . to evaluate the diagnostic performance of laboratories an external quality assurance ( e ##qa ) study was performed in 2004 . participating laboratories ( 9 / 20 ) correctly detected anti - sar ##s antibodies in serum samples without false positive results in an im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence ass ##ay . in contrast , only 4 / 13 laboratories detected most of the anti - sar ##s antibody positive samples without false positive results using enzyme im ##mun ##oa ##ssa ##ys ( e ##ia ) and / or im ##mun ##ob ##lot . the overall results clearly demonstrate that ser ##ological diagnosis of sar ##s - co ##v remains at an early stage of development , with further technical improvements required , particularly with respect to the use of sar ##s specific e ##ias .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is a cause of severe respiratory infection in humans , specifically the elderly and people with como ##rb ##idi ##ties . the re - emergence of lethal corona ##virus ##es calls for international collaboration to produce corona ##virus vaccines , which are still lacking to date . ongoing efforts to develop mer ##s - co ##v vaccines should consider the different target populations ( dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s and humans ) and the co ##rre ##lates of protection . extending on our current knowledge of mer ##s , va ##cci ##nation of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s to induce mu ##cos ##al immunity could be a promising approach to dim ##ini ##sh mer ##s - co ##v transmission to humans . in addition , it is equally important to develop vaccines for humans that induce broader react ##ivity against various corona ##virus ##es to be prepared for a potential next co ##v outbreak .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a life - threatening disease caused by a novel corona ##virus termed sar ##s - co ##v . due to the severity of this disease , the world health organization ( who ) recommends that manipulation of active viral cultures of sar ##s - co ##v be performed in containment laboratories at bio ##sa ##fe ##ty level 3 ( bs ##l ##3 ) . the virus was inactivated by ultraviolet light ( uv ) at 254 ##n ##m , heat treatment of 65 ##° ##c or greater , al ##kali ##ne ( ph > 12 ) or acidic ( ph < 3 ) conditions , formal ##in and g ##lu ##tara ##lde ##hy ##de treatments . we describe the kinetic ##s of these efficient viral ina ##ct ##ivation methods , which will allow research with sar ##s - co ##v containing materials , that are rendered non - infectious , to be conducted at reduced safety levels .  
in their comment in the lance ##t child & adolescent health , jian ##hui wang and colleagues ##1 suggested a plan to handle neon ##ates with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) infections and outbreak ##s in neon ##atal intensive care units ( nic ##us ) . this is a timely reflection , given the public health problem represented by this infection and the need to anti ##ci ##pate any critical care issue , ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of patients ' ages . however , the plan is incomplete or unsuitable in many points . we do not know anything about neon ##atal sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infections , and we must reasonably follow data from adult critical care . first , testing all nic ##u - admitted neon ##ates for sar ##s - co ##v - 2 represents a wrong ##ful use of resources . neon ##atal respiratory failure can result from a wide range of causes , and testing everybody when other causes are reasonably suspected will divert laboratory resources from adult critical care . tests should be done for infants from families infected by sar ##s - co ##v - 2 or exposed to other infected people , ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of their symptoms .  
abstract in this study , we analyzed the replication and bud ##ding sites of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) at early time points of infection . we detected cy ##top ##las ##mic accumulation ##s containing the viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein , viral rna and the non - structural protein ns ##p ##3 . using em techniques , we found that these put ##ative viral replication sites were associated with characteristic membrane tub ##ules and double membrane ve ##sic ##les that most probably originated from er cis ##tern ##ae . in addition to its presence at the replication sites , n also accumulated in the go ##l ##gi region and col ##oca ##lized with the viral spike protein . im ##mun ##o - em revealed that bud ##ding occurred at membranes of the er ##gic ( er – go ##l ##gi intermediate compartment ) and the go ##l ##gi region as early as 3 h post infection , demonstrating that sar ##s - co ##v replicate ##s surprisingly fast . our data suggest that sar ##s - co ##v establishes replication complexes at er - derived membranes . later on , viral nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##ids have to be transported to the bud ##ding sites in the go ##l ##gi region where the viral g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s accumulate and particle formation occurs .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been a highly threatening zoo ##not ##ic pathogen since its outbreak in 2012 . similar to sar ##s - co ##v , mer ##s - co ##v belongs to the corona ##virus family and can induce severe respiratory symptoms in humans , with an average case fatal ##ity rate of 35 % according to the world health organization . spike ( s ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v is im ##mun ##ogenic and can induce neutral ##izing antibodies , thus is a potential major target for vaccine development . here we constructed a chi ##meric virus based on the ve ##sic ##ular st ##oma ##ti ##tis virus ( vs ##v ) in which the g gene was replaced by mer ##s - co ##v s gene ( vs ##v ##δ ##g - mer ##s ) . the s protein efficiently incorporated into the viral envelope and mediated cell entry through binding its receptor , human d ##pp ##4 . knock ##down of cl ##ath ##rin expression by sir ##na drastically ab ##rogated the infection of vs ##v ##δ ##g - mer ##s in ve ##ro cells . furthermore , in animal studies , the rec ##om ##bina ##nt virus induced neutral ##izing antibodies and t cell responses in r ##hes ##us monkeys after a single intra ##mus ##cular or intra ##nas ##al im ##mun ##ization dose . our findings indicate the potential of the chi ##meric vs ##v ##δ ##g - mer ##s as a rapid response vaccine candidate against emerging mer ##s - co ##v disease .  
summary infection due to the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) is widespread . the present study was performed to assess the protocols used for the molecular diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v by analyzing the nu ##cle ##otide sequences of viruses detected between 2012 and 2015 , including sequences from the large outbreak in eastern asia in 2015 . although the diagnostic protocols were established only 2 years ago , mis ##mat ##ches between the sequences of prime ##rs / probe ##s and viruses were found for several of the ass ##ays . such mis ##mat ##ches could lead to a lower sensitivity of the ass ##ay , thereby leading to false - negative diagnosis . a slight modification in the prime ##r design is suggested . protocols for the molecular diagnosis of viral infections should be reviewed regularly after they are established , particularly for viruses that pose a great threat to public health such as mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly infectious disease caused by a novel corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . specific mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) against the sar ##s - co ##v are vital for early diagnosis and path ##ological studies of sar ##s . direct intra ##sp ##len ##ic in ##oc ##ulation of pl ##as ##mi ##d dna encoding antigen is an effective and fast approach to generate specific mab when the protein antigen is difficult to prepare or dangerous in use . in this study , we selected one fragment of sar ##s - co ##v spike protein ( s ##1 - 3 ) as antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt by im ##mun ##oin ##form ##atics . single intra ##sp ##len ##ic im ##mun ##ization of pl ##as ##mi ##d dna encoding s ##1 - 3 induced anti - spike protein antibodies . we established one hybrid ##oma cell line secret ##ing specific mab and evaluated this mab with mu ##rine leukemia virus pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v spike protein ( ml ##v / sar ##s - co ##v ) . the mab could recognize the spike protein on the ml ##v / sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells albeit with no neutral ##izing effect on the in ##fect ##ivity of the pseudo ##type virus . our results show that a single - shot intra ##sp ##len ##ic dna im ##mun ##ization is efficient for the production of specific mab against sar ##s spike protein , and a linear ep ##ito ##pe of the spike protein is recognized in this study .  
within weeks of the first cases , a series of papers were released detailing the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of the disease ( now termed co ##vid ‐ 19 ) [ 1 - 3 ] . by early january 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined . the virus ( termed sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 ) shares 88 % sequence identity to two corona ##virus ##es found in bats , bat ‐ sl ##co ##v ##z ##c ##45 and bat ‐ sl ‐ co ##v ##z ##x ##c ##21 , 79 % identity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus and 50 % identity with middle eastern respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus [ 4 ] . from the first co ##hort of patients , 8 complete genome ##s were 99 . 9 % identical in sequence . given that the typical rna corona ##virus evolve ##s at a rate of 104 nu ##cle ##otide substitution ##s per year , this suggests a recent single source emergence in early december or late november 2019 [ 4 ] . sar ##s ‐ co ##v ‐ 2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands , surfaces and aero ##sol ##ised droplets ; extensive human ‐ to ‐ human transmission is evident , with clusters of infected families and medical staff [ 5 ] . the number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly , at a rate that far outs ##trip ##ped the rate of rise of cases of sar ##s in 2002 / 3 , raising serious global health concerns . by the 21st january , co ##vid ‐ 19 cases were widespread across mainland china , soon spreading beyond the chinese borders .  
the epidemic of 2019 novel corona ##virus , later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , is still gradually spreading worldwide . the nuclei ##c acid test or genetic sequencing serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of infection , yet several recent studies have reported false - negative results of real - time reverse - transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) . here , we report two representative false - negative cases and discuss the supplementary role of clinical data with rr ##t - pc ##r , including laboratory examination results and computed tom ##ography features . coin ##fect ##ion with sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and other viruses has been discussed as well .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) poses a considerable threat to human health . activation of the viral spike ( s ) - protein by host cell pro ##tea ##ses is essential for viral in ##fect ##ivity . however , the cleavage sites in sar ##s - s and the pro ##tea ##se ( s ) act ##ivating sar ##s - s are incomplete ##ly defined . we found that r ##66 ##7 was di ##sp ##ens ##able for sar ##s - s - driven virus – cell fusion and for sar ##s - s - activation by try ##ps ##in and cat ##he ##ps ##in l in a virus – virus fusion ass ##ay . mutation t ##7 ##60 ##r , which opt ##imi ##zes the minimal fur ##in consensus motif 75 ##8 - r ##xx ##r - 76 ##2 , and fur ##in over ##ex ##press ##ion augmented sar ##s - s activity , but did not result in detect ##able sar ##s - s cleavage . finally , sar ##s - s - driven cell – cell fusion was independent of cat ##he ##ps ##in l , a pro ##tea ##se essential for virus – cell fusion . instead , a so far unknown le ##up ##ept ##in - sensitive host cell pro ##tea ##se activated cellular sar ##s - s for fusion with target cells expressing high levels of ace ##2 . thus , different host cell pro ##tea ##ses activate sar ##s - s for virus – cell and cell – cell fusion and sar ##s - s cleavage at r ##66 ##7 and 75 ##8 - r ##xx ##r - 76 ##2 can be di ##sp ##ens ##able for sar ##s - s activation .  
abstract inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has been tested as a candidate vaccine against the re - emergence of sar ##s . in order to understand the efficacy and safety of this approach , it is important to know the antibody specific ##ities generated with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v . in the current study , a panel of twelve mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) was established by im ##mun ##izing bal ##b / c mice with the inactivated b ##j ##01 strain of sar ##s - co ##v isolated from the lung tissue of a sar ##s - infected chinese patient . these mab ##s could recognize sar ##s - co ##v - infected cells by im ##mun ##of ##lu ##orescence analysis ( if ##a ) . seven of them were mapped to the specific segments of rec ##om ##bina ##nt spike ( s ) protein : six on s ##1 subunit ( aa 12 – 79 ##8 ) and one on s ##2 subunit ( aa 79 ##7 – 119 ##2 ) . high neutral ##izing ti ##ters against sar ##s - co ##v were detected with two mab ##s ( 1a ##5 and 2 ##c ##5 ) targeting at a sub ##dom ##ain of s protein ( aa 310 – 53 ##5 ) , consistent with the previous report that this segment of s protein contains the major neutral ##izing domain . some of these s - specific mab ##s were able to recognize cl ##ea ##ved products of s protein in sar ##s - co ##v - infected ve ##ro e ##6 cells . none of the remaining five mab ##s could recognize either of the rec ##om ##bina ##nt s , n , m , or e antigen ##s by elisa . this study demonstrated that the inactivated sar ##s - co ##v was able to preserve the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of s protein including its major neutral ##izing domain . the relative ease with which these mab ##s were generated against sar ##s - co ##v vi ##rion ##s further supports that subunit va ##cci ##nation with s construct ##s may also be able to protect animals and perhaps humans . it is somewhat unexpected that no n - specific mab ##s were identified albeit anti - n i ##gg was easily identified in sar ##s - co ##v - infected patients . the availability of this panel of mab ##s also provided potentially useful agents with applications in therapy , diagnosis , and basic research of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) in ##fect ##s host cells with its surface g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted spike - protein ( s - protein ) . here we expressed the sar ##s - co ##v s - protein to investigate its interactions with innate immune mechanisms in the lung . the pu ##rified s - protein was detected as a 210 ##k ##da g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##ted protein . it was not secret ##ed in the presence of tunic ##amy ##cin and was detected as a 130 ##k ##da protein in the cell l ##ys ##ate . the pu ##rified s - protein bound to ve ##ro but not 293 ##t cells and was itself recognized by lung surf ##act ##ant protein d ( sp - d ) , a collect ##in found in the lung al ##ve ##oli . the binding required ca ##2 + and was inhibit ##ed by mal ##tose . the serum collect ##in , mann ##an - binding le ##ct ##in ( mb ##l ) , exhibited no detect ##able binding to the pu ##rified s - protein . s - protein binds and activate ##s macro ##pha ##ges but not den ##dr ##itic cells ( dc ##s ) . it suggests that sar ##s - co ##v interact ##s with innate immune mechanisms in the lung through its s - protein and regulates pulmonary inflammation .  
abstract the open - reading - frame 3a of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) had been demonstrated previously to form a cat ##ion - selective channel that may become expressed in the infected cell and is then involved in virus release . drugs that inhibit the ion channel formed by the 3a protein can be expected to inhibit virus release , and would be a source for the development of novel therapeutic agents . here we demonstrate that em ##od ##in can inhibit the 3a ion channel of corona ##virus sar ##s - co ##v and hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 as well as virus release from hc ##ov - o ##c ##43 with a k 1 / 2 value of about 20 ##μ ##m . we suggest that viral ion channels , in general , may be a good target for the development of anti ##vira ##l agents .  
abstract ur ##tica di ##oic ##a ag ##gl ##uti ##nin ( ud ##a ) is a small plant mono ##meric le ##ct ##in , 8 . 7 ##k ##da in size , with an n - ace ##ty ##l ##gl ##uc ##osa ##mine specific ##ity that inhibit ##s viruses from ni ##do ##vira ##les in vitro . in the current study , we first examined the efficacy of ud ##a on the replication of different sar ##s - co ##v strains in ve ##ro 76 cells . ud ##a inhibit ##ed virus replication in a dose - dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the urban ##i strain by 90 % at 1 . 1 ##± ##0 . 4 ##μ ##g / ml in ve ##ro 76 cells . then , ud ##a was tested for efficacy in a lethal sar ##s - co ##v - infected bal ##b / c mouse model . bal ##b / c mice were infected with two ld ##50 ( 57 ##5 ##pf ##u ) of virus for 4 ##h before the mice were treated intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly with ud ##a at 20 , 10 , 5 or 0 ##mg / kg / day for 4 days . treatment with ud ##a at 5 ##mg / kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse - adapted sar ##s - co ##v ( p < 0 . 001 ) , but did not significantly reduce virus lung ti ##ters . all virus - infected mice receiving ud ##a treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss ( p < 0 . 001 ) . ud ##a also effectively reduced lung pathology scores . at day 6 after virus exposure , all groups of mice receiving ud ##a had much lower lung weights than did the place ##bo - treated mice . thus , our data suggest that ud ##a treatment of sar ##s infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss . furthermore , the mode of action of ud ##a in vitro was further investigated using live sar ##s - co ##v urban ##i strain virus and retro ##vira ##l particles pseudo ##type ##d with sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) . ud ##a specifically inhibit ##ed the replication of live sar ##s - co ##v or sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##type ##d virus when added just before , but not after , ads ##or ##ption . these data suggested that ud ##a likely inhibit ##s sar ##s - co ##v infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle , namely , ads ##or ##ption or penetration . in addition , we demonstrated that ud ##a neutral ##izes the virus in ##fect ##ivity , presumably by binding to the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . finally , the target molecule for the inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized . when ud ##a was exposed to
abstract the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in 2012 marked the second time that a new , highly pathogen ##ic corona ##virus has emerged in the human population in the 21st century . in this review , we discuss the current state of knowledge of animal models of mer ##s - co ##v infection . commonly used laboratory animal species such as syrian ham ##sters , mice and fe ##rret ##s are not susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v , due to differences in the mer ##s - co ##v receptor dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) . the initially developed animal models comprise two non ##hum ##an primate species , the r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ue and the common mar ##mos ##et . r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues develop a mild to moderate respiratory disease upon in ##oc ##ulation , reminiscent of mild ##er mer ##s cases , whereas mar ##mos ##ets develop a moderate to severe respiratory disease , rec ##ap ##it ##ulating the severe disease observed in some patients . dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , considered to be the reservoir for mer ##s - co ##v , develop a mild upper respiratory tract infection with abundant viral shed ##ding . although normal mice are not susceptible to mer ##s - co ##v , expression of the human d ##pp ##4 ( hd ##pp ##4 ) overcome ##s the lack of su ##sc ##ept ##ibility . trans ##genic hd ##pp ##4 mice develop severe and lethal respiratory disease upon in ##oc ##ulation with mer ##s - co ##v . these hd ##pp ##4 trans ##genic mice are potentially the ideal first line animal model for efficacy testing of therapeutic and prop ##hyl ##actic counter ##me ##as ##ures . further characterization of identified counter ##me ##as ##ures would ideally be performed in the common mar ##mos ##et model , due to the more severe disease outcome . this article forms part of a symposium in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ” 
abstract the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , nearly a decade after the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) co ##v , highlights the importance of understanding and developing therapeutic treatment for current and emerge ##nt co ##vs . this manuscript explores the role of ns ##p ##16 , a 2 ′ o - methyl - transfer ##ase ( 2 ′ o - mt ##ase ) , in co ##v infection and the host immune response . the review highlights conserved motifs , required interaction partners , as well as the at ##ten ##uation of ns ##p ##16 mutants , and restoration of these mutants in specific immune knockout ##s . importantly , the work also identifies a number of approaches to exploit this understanding for therapeutic treatment and the data clearly illustrate the importance of ns ##p ##16 2 ′ o - mt ##ase activity for co ##v infection and pathogen ##esis .  
there is a worldwide concern about the new corona ##virus 2019 ‐ nc ##ov as a global public health threat . in this article , we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular ep ##ide ##mi ##ological analysis of this new virus . a phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019 ‐ nc ##ov , 12 whole genome sequences of 2019 ‐ nc ##ov , and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank ( five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome , two from middle east respiratory syndrome , and five from bat sar ##s ‐ like corona ##virus ) . fast un ##con ##stra ##ined bay ##esian approximation analysis shows that the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein have some sites under positive pressure , whereas homo ##logy modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses . the phylogenetic tree showed that 2019 ‐ nc ##ov significantly clustered with bat sar ##s ‐ like corona ##virus sequence isolated in 2015 , whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein . from these results , the new 2019 ‐ nc ##ov is distinct from sar ##s virus , probably tr ##as ##mit ##ted from bats after mutation con ##fer ##ring ability to in ##fect humans .  
abstract a new severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) associated with human to human transmission and extreme human sickness has been as of late announced from the city of wu ##han in china . our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genome ##s at various times and locations and to character ##ize the gen ##omic structure of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 using bio ##in ##form ##atics programs . information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention , diagnosis , and therapy of infectious diseases . to understand the gen ##omic structure and variations of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the study analyzed 95 sar ##s - co ##v - 2 complete genome sequences available in gen ##bank , national micro ##biology ##da ##ta center ( nm ##dc ) and ng ##dc genome warehouse from december - 2019 until 05 of april - 2020 . the gen ##omic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection , location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity . we found 116 mutations , the three most common mutations were 87 ##8 ##2 ##c > t in or ##f ##1 ##ab gene , 281 ##44 ##t > c in or ##f ##8 gene and 290 ##9 ##5 ##c > t in the n gene . the mutations might affect the severity and spread of the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 . the finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt , inclusive investigations that combine gen ##omic detail , ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with co ##vid - 19 .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) first emerged in 2012 , and over 2000 infections and 800 deaths have been confirmed in 27 countries . however , to date , no commercial vaccine is available . in this study , structural proteins of mer ##s - co ##v were expressed in silk ##worm larvae and b ##m ##5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates against mer ##s - co ##v and diagnostic methods . the spike ( s ) protein of mer ##s - co ##v lacking its trans ##me ##mb ##rane and cy ##top ##las ##mic domains ( s ##δ ##tm ) was secret ##ed into the hem ##ol ##ym ##ph of silk ##worm larvae using a bomb ##yx ##in signal peptide and pu ##rified using affinity ch ##rom ##ato ##graphy . the pu ##rified s ##δ ##tm forms small nano ##par ##tic ##les as well as the full - length s protein and has the ability to bind human dip ##ept ##id ##yl pep ##ti ##das ##e 4 ( d ##pp ##4 ) , which is a receptor of mer ##s - co ##v . these results indicate that bio ##active s ##δ ##tm was expressed in silk ##worm larvae . to produce mer ##s - co ##v - like particles ( mer ##s - co ##v - lp ##s ) , the coe ##x ##press ##ion of spike proteins was performed in b ##m ##5 cells and envelope ( e ) and membrane ( m ) proteins secret ##ed e and m proteins extra ##cellular ##ly , suggesting that mer ##s - co ##v - lp ##s may be formed . however , this s protein was not displayed on virus - like particles ( v ##lp ##s ) even though e and m proteins were secret ##ed into the culture super ##nat ##ant . by surf ##act ##ant treatment and mechanical ex ##tr ##usion using s protein - or three structural protein - expressing b ##m ##5 cells , s protein - displaying nano ##ves ##icles with diameter ##s of approximately 100 - 200 nm were prepared and confirmed by im ##mun ##o - te ##m . the mechanical ex ##tr ##usion method is favorable for obtaining uniform rec ##om ##bina ##nt protein - displaying nano ##ves ##icles from culture ##d cells . the pu ##rified s ##δ ##tm from silk ##worm larvae and s protein - displaying nano ##ves ##icles from b ##m ##5 cells may lead to the development of nano ##par ##tic ##le - based vaccines against mer ##s - co ##v and the diagnostic detection of mer ##s - co ##v .  
abstract background the increasing reports of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) from many countries emphasize its importance for international travel . muslim pilgrimage ##s of ha ##j ##j and um ##rah involve mass gatherings of international travellers . we set out to assess the presence of influenza and mer ##s - co ##v in ha ##j ##j / um ##rah return ##ees with acute respiratory infection . . methods di ##se ##mba ##rkin ##g passengers ( n = 875 ##3 ) from saudi arabia ( october 2014 to april 2015 ) were interviewed for the presence of respiratory symptoms ; 97 ##7 ( 11 % ) reported symptoms and 300 ( age 26 – 90 , median 60 years ; 140 male ) consent ##ed to participate in the study . after recording clinical and demographic data , twin sw ##ab ##s ( nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al and throat ) were collected from each participant , poole ##d in viral transport media and tested by real - time rt pc ##r for mer ##s - co ##v and influenza a and b viruses and their sub ##type ##s . results the participants had symptoms of 1 – 15 days ( median 5 ##d ) ; cough ( 90 % ) and nasal discharge ( 86 % ) being the common ##est . none of the 300 participants tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v ; however , 33 ( 11 % ) tested positive for influenza viruses ( a / h ##3 ##n ##2 = 13 , a / h ##1 ##n ##1 ##pd ##m ##0 ##9 = 9 and b / ya ##ma ##gata = 11 ) . eighteen patients received os ##elt ##ami ##vir . no hospital ##izations were needed and all had uneven ##tf ##ul recovery . conclusion despite a high prevalence of acute respiratory symptoms , mer ##s co ##v was not seen in returning pilgrims from ha ##j ##j and um ##rah . however detection of flu emphasis ##es prevent ##ive strategies like va ##cci ##nation .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2012 causing a critical challenge to public health . the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of mer ##s - co ##v remain enigma ##tic as human - to - human transmission is not fully understood . one possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural water ##pipe smoking . cafes providing water ##pipe smoking in cities within saudi arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camel ##s markets . we report results of a surveillance study wherein water ##pipe hose ##s throughout several regions in saudi arabia were tested for the presence of mer ##s - co ##v . a total of 248 ##9 water ##pipe samples were collected from cities where mer ##s - co ##v cases were continuously recorded . mer ##s - co ##v rna wasn ’ t detected in collected samples . ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of the negative results of our survey , the public health risk of water ##pipe smoking should not be under ##est ##imated . to avoid a possible transmission within country where mer ##s - co ##v is prevalent , we recommend the replacement of res ##usa ##ble hose ##s with “ one - time - use ” hose ##s in addition to a close inspection of water ##pipe components to assure the appropriate cleaning and san ##iti ##zation .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a highly con ##tag ##ious infectious disease which first emerged in late 2002 , caused by a then novel human corona ##virus , sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . the virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as ci ##vet cats . the re - emergence of sar ##s - co ##v remains a valid concern due to the continual persistence of zoo ##not ##ic sar ##s - co ##vs and sar ##s - like co ##vs ( sl - co ##vs ) in bat reservoirs . in this study , the screening for the presence of sar ##s - specific t cells in a co ##hort of three sar ##s - recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post - infection was carried out , and all memory t cell responses detected target the sar ##s - co ##v structural proteins . two cd ##8 + t cell responses targeting the sar ##s - co ##v membrane ( m ) and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) proteins were characterized by determining their h ##la restriction and minimal t cell ep ##ito ##pe regions . furthermore , these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post - infection . an absence of cross - react ##ivity of these cd ##8 + t cell responses against the newly - emerged middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was also demonstrated . the knowledge of the persistence of sar ##s - specific ce ##lu ##llar immunity targeting the viral structural proteins in sar ##s - recovered individuals is important in the design and development of sar ##s vaccines , which are currently unavailable .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( sar ##s - co ##v n ) is one of the major targets for sar ##s vaccine due to its high pot ##ency in triggering immune responses . in this study , we have identified a novel h ##la - a * 02 ##01 restricted ep ##ito ##pe , n ##22 ##0 ( lal ##ll ##ld ##rl ) , of the sar ##s - co ##v n - protein through bio ##in ##form ##atics analysis . the n - protein peptide n ##22 ##0 shows a high binding affinity towards human m ##hc class i in t ##2 - cells , and is capable of act ##ivating cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t - cells in human peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) . the application of using the n ##22 ##0 peptide sequence with a single - chain - trim ##er ( sc ##t ) approach to produce a potential dna vaccine candidate was investigated in h ##la - a2 . 1 ##k ##b trans ##genic mice . cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city ass ##ay clearly showed that the t - cells obtained from the va ##cci ##nated animals were able to kill the n - protein expressing cells with a cy ##to ##to ##xi ##city level of 86 % in an effect ##or cells / target cells ratio of 81 : 1 one week after the last va ##cci ##nation , which is significantly higher than other n - protein peptide ##s previously described . the novel im ##mun ##ogenic n - protein peptide revealed in the present study provides valuable information for therapeutic sar ##s vaccine design .  
abstract the rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is essential for viral replication and a potential target for anti - sar ##s drugs . we report here the cl ##oning , expression , and purification of the n - terminal gs ##t - fused sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp and its polymer ##ase catalytic domain in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . during purification , the full - length gs ##t - rd ##rp was found to cl ##ea ##ve into three main fragments : an n - terminal p ##12 fragment , a middle p ##30 fragment , and a c - terminal p ##64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain , presumably due to bacterial pro ##tea ##ses . bio ##chemical ass ##ays show that the full - length gs ##t - rd ##rp has rd ##rp activity and the p ##64 and p ##12 fragments form a complex that exhibits comparable rd ##rp activity , whereas the gs ##t - p ##64 protein has no activity , suggesting that the p ##12 domain is required for polymer ##ase activity possibly via involvement in template - prime ##r binding . non ##nu ##cle ##osi ##de hiv - 1 rt inhibitors are shown to have no evident inhibitor ##y effect on sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp activity . this work provides a basis for bio ##chemical and structural studies of sar ##s - co ##v rd ##rp and for development of anti - sar ##s drugs .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) causes severe acute respiratory illness with a case fatal ##ity rate ( cf ##r ) of 35 , 5 % . the highest number of mer ##s - co ##v cases are from saudi - arabia , the major worldwide hot ##sp ##ot for this disease . in the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready - to - use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its ep ##ide ##mi ##ological cycle , prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease ep ##ide ##mi ##ology . we constructed 2 - strain models to predict past outbreak ##s in the interval 2012 – 2016 and derive key ep ##ide ##mi ##ological information for mac ##ca , mad ##ina and ri ##yad ##h . we approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic ( e . g . bi ##line ##ar , b ##l ; non - mono ##tone , nm ; and saturated , sat models ) . the best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of mer ##s - co ##v clinical cases for the 2015 – 2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle . the evolution in the basic reproduction number ( r ( 0 ) ) warns that mer ##s - co ##v may easily take an epidemic form . the best model correctly captures this feature , indicating a high epidemic risk ( 1 ##≤ ##r ( 0 ) ≤ ##2 , 5 ) in ri ##yad ##h and mac ##ca and confirming the alleged co - circulation of more than one strain . accurate predictions of the future mer ##s - co ##v peak week , as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible . these results indicate public health agencies should be aware that measures for strict containment are urgently needed before new epidemic ##s take off in the region .  
abstract sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) has recently been identified as the ca ##usa ##tive agent of sar ##s . we constructed a series of rec ##om ##bina ##nt di ##s ( rd ##is ) , a highly at ##ten ##uated va ##cci ##nia strain , expressing a gene encoding four structural proteins ( e , m , n and s ) of sar ##s - co ##v individually or simultaneously . these rd ##is eli ##cite ##d sar ##s - co ##v - specific serum i ##gg antibody and t - cell responses in va ##cci ##nated mice following intra ##nas ##al or sub ##cut ##aneous administration . mice that were sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly va ##cci ##nated with rd ##is expressing s protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutral ##izing i ##gg antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against sar ##s - co ##v challenge in the absence of a mu ##cos ##al i ##ga response . these results indicate that the potent immune response eli ##cite ##d by sub ##cut ##aneous injection of rd ##is containing s is able to control mu ##cos ##al infection by sar ##s - co ##v . thus , replication - def ##icient di ##s construct ##s hold promise for the development of a safe and potent sar ##s vaccine .  
abstract the pathogen ##esis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of sar ##s . recently , sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro pro ##tea ##se has been implied to be possible relevance to sar ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis . in this study , we intended to identify potential 3 ##cl ##pro - interacting cellular protein ( s ) using the ph ##age - displayed human lung cd ##na library . the va ##cu ##olar - h + atp ##ase ( v - atp ##ase ) g ##1 subunit that contained a 3 ##cl ##pro cleavage site - like motif was identified as a 3 ##cl ##pro - interacting protein , as confirmed using the co - im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation ass ##ay and the relative affinity ass ##ay . in addition , our result also demonstrated the cleavage of the v - atp ##ase g ##1 fusion protein and the im ##mun ##op ##re ##ci ##pit ##ation of cellular v - atp ##ase g ##1 by the 3 ##cl ##pro . moreover , loading cells with s ##nar ##f - 1 ph - sensitive dye showed that the intra ##cellular ph in 3 ##cl ##pro - expressing cells was significantly lower as compared to mock cells .  
abstract the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) on spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is the main region interacting with the viral receptor - ace ##2 and is a useful target for induction of neutral ##izing antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v infection . here we generated two mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( mab ##s ) , targeting rb ##d , with marked virus neutral ##izing activity . the mab ##s recognize a new conform ##ation ##al ep ##ito ##pe which consists of several disco ##nti ##nu ##ous peptide ##s ( aa . 343 – 36 ##7 , 37 ##3 – 390 and 411 – 42 ##8 ) and is spatial ##ly located neighboring the receptor - binding motif ( rpm ) region of the rb ##d . importantly , w ##42 ##3 and n ##42 ##4 residues are essential for mab recognition and are highly conserved among 107 different strains of sar ##s , indicating that the residues are the most critical in the ep ##ito ##pe which is a novel potential target for therapeutic mab ##s . a human – mouse chi ##meric antibody , based upon the original mu ##rine mab , was also constructed and shown to possess good neutral ##izing activity and high affinity .  
in order to develop clinical diagnostic tools for rapid detection of sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ) and to identify candidate proteins for vaccine development , the c - terminal portion of the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( nc ) gene was amplified using rt - pc ##r from the sar ##s - co ##v genome , clone ##d into a yeast expression vector ( peg ##h ) , and expressed as a g ##lu ##tat ##hi ##one s - transfer ##ase ( gs ##t ) and his ##x ##6 double - tagged fusion protein under the control of an ind ##ucible promoter . western analysis on the pu ##rified protein confirmed the expression and purification of the nc fusion proteins from yeast . to determine its antigen ##ici ##ty , the fusion protein was challenged with serum samples from sar ##s patients and normal controls . the nc fusion protein demonstrated high antigen ##ici ##ty with high specific ##ity , and therefore , it should have great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tools and provide useful information for vaccine development .  
abstract background information on the duration of replica ##tive middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) shed ##ding is important for infection control . the detection of mer ##s - co ##v sub - gen ##omic mrna ##s indicates that the virus is replica ##tive . this study examined the duration for detecting mer ##s - co ##v sub - gen ##omic mrna compared with gen ##omic rna in diverse respiratory specimens . methods upper and lower respiratory samples were obtained from 17 mer ##s - co ##v - infected patients . mer ##s - co ##v sub - gen ##omic mrna was detected by reverse transcription pc ##r ( rt - pc ##r ) and mer ##s - co ##v gen ##omic rna by real - time rt - pc ##r . results in sp ##ut ##um and trans ##tra ##che ##al as ##pi ##rate , sub - gen ##omic mrna was detected for up to 4 weeks after symptoms developed , which correlated with the detection of gen ##omic rna . in oro ##pha ##ryn ##ge ##al and nas ##op ##har ##yn ##ge ##al sw ##ab specimens , the detection of sub - gen ##omic mrna and gen ##omic rna did not co ##rre ##late . conclusions these findings suggest that mer ##s - co ##v does not replicate well in the upper respiratory tract .  
abstract background the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreak ##s . the disease carries a high case fatal ##ity rate of 34 . 5 % , and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy . method we searched med ##line , science direct , em ##base and sc ##opus databases for relevant papers published till march 2019 describing in vitro , in vivo or human therapy of mer ##s . results initial search identified 62 articles : 52 articles were from med ##line , 6 from em ##base , and 4 from science direct . based on the inclusion ##s and exclusion ##s criteria , 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised : 22 in vitro studies , 8 studies utilizing animal models , 13 studies in humans , and one study included both in vitro and animal model . there are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon . the combination of lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r and inter ##fer ##on - beta - 1b showed excellent results in common mar ##mos ##ets and currently is in a random ##ized control trial . rib ##avi ##rin and inter ##fer ##on were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observation ##al studies . although , the data are het ##ero ##gen ##ous , this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation . there were no random ##ized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of mer ##s - co ##v infection . only one such study is planned for random ##ization and is pending completion . the study is based on a combination of lo ##pina ##vir / ri ##ton ##avi ##r and inter ##fer ##on - beta - 1b . a fully human poly ##cl ##onal i ##gg antibody ( sa ##b - 301 ) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy . conclusion despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for mer ##s - co ##v . random ##ized clinical trials are needed and potential the ##ra ##pies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials . in order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for mer ##s - co ##v infection , rep ##ur ##po ##sing old drugs against mer ##s - co ##v is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings .  
abstract as a critical adaptive mechanism , amino acid replacements on the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein could alter the receptor - binding specific ##ity of this envelope g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein and in turn lead to the emergence or re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of this viral zoo ##nosis . based on the x - ray structures of sar ##s - co ##v spike receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in complex with its functional receptor ( ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 , ace ##2 ) , we perform computational simulations of interactions between three representative rb ##d mutants and four host species - specific receptors . the comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidence ##s valid ##ate our structural bio ##in ##form ##atics approaches . and the predictions further indicate that some viral prototypes might utilize the rat ace ##2 while rats might serve as a vector or reservoir of sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract objective we aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) among ha ##j ##j pilgrims before and after an education health programme during international vaccine consultation ##s in france . study design a cross - sectional study was performed in the consultation for travel medicine and international va ##cci ##nation in rei ##ms university hospital between july 2014 and october 2015 . methods consecutive adults ( > 18 years old ) who attended for pre - ha ##j ##j men ##ing ##oco ##cca ##l va ##cci ##nation were eligible to complete an anonymous question ##naire with closed answers to evaluate their level of knowledge about mer ##s - co ##v . to evaluate the effectiveness of the information given during the consultation , the same question ##naire was completed by the ha ##j ##j pilgrim before and after the consultation , where the information about mer ##s - co ##v was provided . results among 82 ha ##j ##j pilgrim adults enrolled in the study , less than 25 % were aware of the routes of transmission , symptoms and prevent ##ive behaviour ##s to adopt abroad or in case of fever . pilgrims had a higher rate of correct responses on each question at the time they completed the second question ##naire , as compared with the first , with 11 of 13 questions answered significantly better after delivery of educational information about mer ##s - co ##v . however , although the rate of correct answers to the questions about routes of transmission , symptoms , prevent ##ive behaviour ##s to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential mer ##s - co ##v occurrence increased significantly after receiving the information , the rates remained below 50 % . conclusion information given during travel consultation ##s significantly increases the general level of knowledge , but not enough to achieve epidemic control .  
the r ( replica ##se ) protein is the uniquely defined non - structural protein ( ns ##p ) responsible for rna replication , mutation rate or fidelity , regulation of transcription in corona ##virus ##es and many other ssr ##na viruses . based on our complete genome sequences of four isolate ##s ( b ##j ##01 - b ##j ##0 ##4 ) of sar ##s - co ##v from beijing , china , we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the r protein in comparison with 13 other isolate ##s of sar ##s - co ##v and 6 other corona ##virus ##es . the entire or ##f ( open - reading frame ) en ##codes for two major enzyme activities , rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( rd ##rp ) and protein ##ase activities . the r poly ##pro ##tein undergoes a complex pro ##te ##ol ##ytic process to produce 15 function - related peptide ##s . a hydro ##phobic domain ( ho ##d ) and a hydro ##phi ##lic domain ( hid ) are newly identified within ns ##p ##1 . the substitution rate of the r protein is close to the average of the sar ##s - co ##v genome . the functional domains in all ns ##ps of the r protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure . eleven highly conserved regions in rd ##rp and twelve cleavage sites by 3 ##cl ##p ( ch ##ym ##ot ##ry ##ps ##in - like protein ) have been identified as potential drug targets . findings suggest that it is possible to obtain information about the ph ##yl ##ogen ##y of sar ##s - co ##v , as well as potential tools for drug design , gen ##ot ##yp ##ing and diagnostic ##s of sar ##s .  
abstract the spike ( s ) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is not only responsible for receptor binding , but also a major antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nt capable of inducing protective immunity . in this study , we demonstrated that the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of s protein is an important im ##mun ##ogenic site in patients with sar ##s and rabbits im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v . serum samples from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients and im ##mun ##ized rabbits had potent neutral ##izing activities against infection by pseudo ##virus expressing sar ##s - co ##v s protein . de ##ple ##tion of rb ##d - specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by im ##mun ##oa ##ds ##or ##ption significantly reduced serum - mediated neutral ##izing activity , while affinity - pu ##rified anti - rb ##d antibodies had relatively higher pot ##ency neutral ##izing in ##fect ##ivity of sar ##s pseudo ##virus , indicating that the rb ##d of s protein is a critical neutral ##ization deter ##mina ##nt of sar ##s - co ##v during viral infection and im ##mun ##ization . two mono ##cl ##onal antibodies ( 1a ##5 and 2 ##c ##5 ) targeting at the rb ##d of s protein were isolated from mice im ##mun ##ized with inactivated sar ##s - co ##v . both 1a ##5 and 2 ##c ##5 possessed potent neutral ##izing activities , although they directed against distinct conform ##ation - depend ##ant ep ##ito ##pes as shown by elisa and binding competition ass ##ay . we further demonstrated that 2 ##c ##5 , but not 1a ##5 , was able to block binding of the rb ##d to ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) , the functional receptor on targeted cells . these data provide important information for understanding the antigen ##ici ##ty and im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of sar ##s - co ##v and for designing sar ##s vaccines .  
abstract the highly pathogen ##ic middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - related corona ##virus ( co ##v ) is transmitted from dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s , the natural reservoir , to humans . for at present unclear reasons , mer ##s cases have so far only been observed in the arabian peninsula , although mer ##s - co ##v also ci ##rc ##ulates in african dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s . a recent study showed that mer ##s - co ##v found in north / west - ( morocco ) and west - african ( burkina faso and nigeria ) dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s are genetically distinct from arabian viruses and have reduced replica ##tive capacity in human cells , potentially due to amino acid changes in one or more viral proteins . here , we show that the spike ( s ) proteins of the proto ##typic arabian mer ##s - co ##v strain , human beta ##cor ##ona ##virus 2 ##c em ##c / 2012 , and the above stated african mer ##s - co ##v variants do not app ##re ##cia ##bly differ in expression , d ##pp ##4 binding and ability to drive entry into target cells . thus , virus - host - interactions at the entry stage may not limit spread of north - and west - african mer ##s - co ##v in human cells .  
abstract a new disease , termed severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , emerged at the end of 2002 and caused profound disturbances in over 30 countries worldwide in 2003 . a novel corona ##virus was identified as the ae ##ti ##ological agent of sar ##s and the 30 ##k ##b viral genome was dec ##ip ##hered with unprecedented speed in a coordinated manner by the global community . since then , much progress has been made in the vi ##rol ##ogical and molecular characterization of the proteins encoded by sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome , which contains 14 potential open reading frames ( or ##fs ) . these investigations can be broadly classified into three groups : ( a ) studies on the replica ##se 1a / 1b gene products which are important for viral replication , ( b ) studies on the structural proteins , spike , nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id , membrane and envelope , which have homo ##logue ##s in all corona ##virus ##es , and are important for viral assembly and ( c ) expression and functional studies of the “ accessory ” proteins that are specifically encoded by sar ##s - co ##v . a comparison of the properties of these three groups of sar ##s - co ##v proteins with the knowledge that corona ##vir ##ologists have generated over more than 30 years of research can help us in the prevention and treatment of sar ##s in the event of the re - emergence of this new infectious disease .  
abstract the papa ##in - like pro ##tea ##se of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( pl ##pro ) ( ec 3 . 4 . 22 . 46 ) is essential for the viral life cycle and therefore represents an important anti ##vira ##l target . we have identified 6 ##mp and 6 ##t ##g as rev ##ers ##ible and slow - binding inhibitors of sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , which is the first report about small molecule rev ##ers ##ible inhibitors of pl ##pro . the inhibition mechanism was investigated by kinetic measurements and computer docking . both compounds are competitive , selective , and rev ##ers ##ible inhibitors of the pl ##pro with k is values [UNK] to 20 ##μ ##m . a structure – function relationship study has identified the th ##io ##carbon ##yl moi ##ety of 6 ##mp or 6 ##t ##g as the active ph ##arm ##aco ##ph ##ore essential for these inhibition ##s , which has not been reported before . the inhibition is selective because these compounds do not ex ##ert significant inhibitor ##y effects against other cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses , including sar ##s - co ##v 3 ##cl ##pro and several cat ##he ##ps ##ins . thus , our results present the first potential chemical leads against sar ##s - co ##v pl ##pro , which might be used as lead compounds for further optimization to enhance their pot ##ency against sar ##s - co ##v . both 6 ##mp and 6 ##t ##g are still used extensively in clinics , especially for children with acute l ##ym ##ph ##ob ##lastic or my ##elo ##bla ##stic leukemia . in light of the possible inhibition against subset of cy ##stein ##e pro ##tea ##ses , our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth these drug actions in vivo .  
abstract induction of effective cy ##to ##to ##xi ##c t l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte ( ct ##l ) and / or a specific antibody against conserved viral proteins may be essential to the development of a safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) vaccine . dna va ##cci ##nation represents a new strategy for induction of humor ##al and cellular immune response . to determine the ability of sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##op ##rot ##ein ( n protein ) to induce anti ##vira ##l immunity , in this report , we established a stable c2 ##c ##12 line expressing sar ##s - co ##v n protein , which was used as a target for specific ct ##l ass ##ay . we also expressed rec ##om ##bina ##nt n proteins in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli and prepared n protein - specific poly ##cl ##onal antibodies . c ##3 ##h / he mice were im ##mun ##ized with n protein - express ##ible pc ##d ##n - f ##n vector by intra ##mus ##cular injection ##s . we found that the dna va ##cci ##nation induced both n protein - specific antibody and specific ct ##l activity to the target . when c ##3 ##h / he mice were im ##mun ##ized by three separate injection ##s , high antibody ti ##tre ( 1 : 320 ##0 – 1 : 640 ##0 , average ti ##tre is 1 : 45 ##80 ) and high ct ##l activity ( 67 . 4 ##± ##8 . 4 % ( e : t = 25 : 1 ) , 69 . 6 ##± ##6 . 7 % ( e : t = 50 : 1 ) and 71 . 8 ##± ##6 . 2 % ( e : t = 100 : 1 ) ) were observed . in the case of two vaccine injection ##s , ct ##l activity was also high ( 56 . 6 ##± ##12 . 7 % ( e : t = 25 : 1 ) , 57 . 4 ##± ##11 . 7 % ( e : t = 50 : 1 ) and 63 . 0 ##± ##6 . 3 % ( e : t = 100 : 1 ) ) . however , antibody ti ##tres were much lower ( 1 : 200 – 1 : 320 ##0 , average ti ##tre is 1 : 980 ) . our results suggest that sar ##s - co ##v nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene might be a candidate gene for sar ##s dna va ##cci ##nation .  
ann ##ota ##tion of the genome sequence of the sar ##s - co ##v ( severe acute respiratory syndrome - associated corona ##virus ) is ind ##is ##pen ##sable to understand its evolution and pathogen ##esis . we have performed a full ann ##ota ##tion of the sar ##s - co ##v genome sequences by using ann ##ota ##tion programs publicly available or developed by ourselves . totally , 21 open reading frames ( or ##fs ) of genes or put ##ative un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##ized proteins ( pup ##s ) were predicted . seven pup ##s had not been reported previously , and two of them were predicted to contain trans ##me ##mb ##rane regions . eight or ##fs partially overlap ##ped with or embedded into those of known genes , revealing that the sar ##s - co ##v genome is a small and compact one with overlap ##ped coding regions . the most striking discovery is that an or ##f locate ##s on the minus strand . we have also ann ##ota ##ted non - coding regions and identified the transcription regulating sequences ( tr ##s ) in the inter ##genic regions . the analysis of tr ##s supports the minus strand extending transcription mechanism of corona ##virus . the s ##np analysis of different isolate ##s reveals that mutations of the sequences do not affect the prediction results of or ##fs .  
abstract studies of sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) — the ca ##usa ##tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) — have been hampered by its high transmission rate and the pathogen ##ici ##ty of this virus . to permit analysis of the host range and entry mechanism of sar ##s - co ##v , we incorporated the human ##ized sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein into hiv particles to generate a highly infectious sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##type ##d virus . the infection on ve ##ro e ##6 — a per ##missive cell line to sar ##s - co ##v — could be neutral ##ized by sera from con ##vale ##scent sar ##s patients , and the entry was a ph - dependent process . with these highly infectious sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##type ##s , several cell lines derived from various tissues were revealed as susceptible to sar ##s - co ##v , which were highly corresponding to the expression pattern of virus ’ s receptor ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) . in addition , we also demonstrated ang ##iot ##ens ##in 1 converting enzyme ( ace ) — the homo ##logue of ace ##2 could not function as a receptor for sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract background since the initial description of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , we adopted a systematic process of screening patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia . here , we report the result of the surveillance activity in a general hospital in saudi arabia over a four year period . materials and methods all admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia from 2012 to 2016 were tested for mer ##s - co ##v . in addition , testing for influenza viruses was carried out starting april 2015 . results during the study period , a total of 265 ##7 patients were screened for mer ##s - co ##v and only 20 ( 0 . 74 % ) tested positive . from january 2015 to december 2016 , a total of 1644 patients were tested for both mer ##s - co ##v and influenza . none of the patients tested positive for mer ##s - co ##v and 271 ( 16 . 4 % ) were positive for influenza . the detected influenza viruses were influenza a ( 107 , 6 . 5 % ) , pan ##de ##mic 2009 h ##1 ##n ##1 ( n = 120 , 7 . 3 % ) , and influenza b ( n = 44 , 2 . 7 % ) . pan ##de ##mic h ##1 ##n ##1 was the most common influenza in 2015 with a peak in peaked october to december and influenza a other than h ##1 ##n ##1 was more common in 2016 with a peak in august and then october to december . conclusions mer ##s - co ##v was a rare cause of community acquired pneumonia and other viral causes including influenza were much more common . thus , admitted patients are potentially manage ##able with os ##elt ##ami ##vir or za ##nami ##vir therapy .  
summary background a case control study to better character ##ize the clinical features , laboratory , and radio ##logical abnormalities associated with mer ##s - co ##v infection in order to help with early identification of this syndrome from other respiratory infections . methods eighty patients admitted to a hospital in ri ##yad ##h , diagnosed with mer ##s - co ##v infection based on rt - pc ##r were matched on age , sex , and the presence of a co - mor ##bid condition on a basis of 1 : 2 to other patients admitted with respiratory symptoms and tested negative for mer ##s - co ##v on rt - pc ##r . results none of the reported mer ##s - co ##v presenting symptoms was significantly associated with being infected with mer ##s - co ##v . on the other hand , wb ##c count was significantly lower in patients with confirmed mer ##s - co ##v infection ( median 5 . 7 vs 9 . 3 , p : 0 . 000 ##4 ) . ne ##ut ##rop ##hil count was as well significantly lower in mer ##s - co ##v patients ( median 3 . 7 vs 6 . 7 , p : 0 . 000 ##1 ) . both as ##t , and alt values were significantly higher in mer ##s - co ##v infected group ( as ##t median 42 vs 36 , p : 0 . 03 , and alt median 33 vs 28 , p : 0 . 00 ##3 ) . overall our mer ##s - co ##v mortality rate was ( 10 % ) below the national figure of ( 40 % ) . conclusions none of the presenting symptoms are specific for mer ##s - co ##v infection . and out of all the investigations wb ##c , ne ##ut ##rop ##hil counts , as ##t and alt values have some predict ##ive utility .  
summary development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) is crucial in the prevention of sar ##s re ##eme ##rgen ##ce . the receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) of sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein is an important target in developing safe and effective sar ##s vaccines . our previous study has demonstrated that va ##cci ##nation with aden ##o - associated virus encoding rb ##d ( rb ##d - ra ##av ) induce ##s high ti ##ter of neutral ##izing antibodies . in this study , we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the im ##mun ##ization with rb ##d - ra ##av prime / rb ##d - specific t cell peptide boost . compared with the rb ##d - ra ##av prime / boost va ##cci ##nation , rb ##d - ra ##av prime / rb ##d - peptide ( rb ##d - pep ) boost induced similar levels of th ##1 and neutral ##izing antibody responses that protected the va ##cci ##nated mice from subsequent sar ##s - co ##v challenge , but stronger th ##2 and ct ##l responses . no significant immune responses and protective effects were detected in mice va ##cci ##nated with rb ##d - pep or blank aa ##v alone . since t cell ep ##ito ##pes are highly conserved and boost ##ing with peptide ##s may induce the production of effect ##or memory t cells , which may be effective against viruses with mutations in the neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes , our results suggest that the va ##cci ##nation protocol used may be ideal for providing effective , broad and long - term protection against sar ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract mer ##s - co ##v , a highly pathogen ##ic virus in humans , is associated with high mor ##bid ##ity and case fatal ##ity . inflammatory responses have a significant impact on mer ##s - co ##v pathogen ##esis and disease outcome . however , cd ##4 + t - cell induced immune responses during acute mer ##s - co ##v infection are barely detect ##able , with potent inhibition of effect ##or t cells and down ##re ##gul ##ation of antigen presentation . the local pulmonary immune response , particularly the th ##1 and th ##2 - related immune response during acute severe mer ##s - co ##v infection is not fully understood . in this study , we offer the first insights into the pulmonary gene expression profile of th ##1 and th ##2 - related cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es ( th ##1 & th ##2 responses ) during acute mer ##s - co ##v infection using rt ##2 profile ##r pc ##r arrays . we also quan ##ti ##fied the expression level of primary inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines / che ##mo ##kin ##es . our results showed a down ##re ##gul ##ation of th ##2 , inadequate ( partial ) th ##1 immune response and high expression levels of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines il - 1 ##α and il - 1 ##β and the ne ##ut ##rop ##hil che ##mo ##att ##rac ##tan ##t che ##mo ##kin ##e il - 8 ( c ##x ##cl ##8 ) in the lower respiratory tract of mer ##s - co ##v infected patients . moreover , we identified a high viral load in all included patients . we also observed a correlation between inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines , th ##1 , and th ##2 down ##re ##gul ##ation and the case fatal ##ity rate . th ##1 and th ##2 response down ##re ##gul ##ation , high expression of inflammatory cy ##tok ##ines , and high viral load may contribute to lung inflammation , severe infection , the evolution of pneumonia and ar ##ds , and a higher case fatal ##ity rate . further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the th ##1 and th ##2 regulatory pathways will be vital for active vaccine development and the identification of novel therapeutic strategies .  
abstract background : the effect of co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid treatment on the viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) patients is unknown . objective : to compare the plasma sar ##s - co ##v rna concentrations in rib ##avi ##rin - treated patients who received early hydro ##cor ##tis ##one therapy with those who received place ##bo . study design : serial plasma sar ##s - co ##v rna concentrations measured in the setting of a prospective , random ##ized double - blinded , place ##bo - controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of “ early ” ( < 7 days of illness ) hydro ##cor ##tis ##one use in previously healthy sar ##s patients were analyzed . sar ##s - co ##v rna was quan ##ti ##fied using a one - step real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay targeting the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id gene . results : among 16 non - ic ##u cases , sar ##s - co ##v rna was detected in plasma since day 3 – 4 after fever onset ; viral concentration peaked in the first week , which then rapidly declined in the second week of illness . on days 8 , 12 , 16 , and 20 , the cumulative proportion of patients with und ##ete ##ctable virus in plasma was 31 % , 69 % , 92 % , and 100 % , respectively . plasma sar ##s - co ##v rna concentrations in the second and third week of illness were significantly higher in patients who received initial hydro ##cor ##tis ##one treatment ( n = 9 ) , as compared to those who received place ##bo ( n = 7 ) ( au ##c ; mann – whitney , p = 0 . 02 ##3 ) . the median time for sar ##s - co ##v to become und ##ete ##ctable in plasma was 12 days ( 11 – 20 days ) versus 8 days ( 8 – 15 days ) , respectively . conclusion : our findings suggested “ early ” co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oid treatment was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load .  
background . middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 , causing severe acute respiratory disease and pneumonia , with 44 % mortality among 136 cases to date . design of vaccines to limit the virus spread or diagnostic tests to track newly emerging strains requires knowledge of antigen ##ic and ser ##olo ##gic relationships between mer ##s - co ##v and other co ##vs . methods . using synthetic gen ##omics and venezuelan e ##quin ##e en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus rep ##lic ##ons ( vr ##ps ) expressing spike and nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id proteins from mer ##s - co ##v and other human and bat co ##vs , we character ##ize the antigen ##ic responses ( using western b ##lot and enzyme - linked im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ay ) and ser ##olo ##gic responses ( using neutral ##ization ass ##ays ) against 2 mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s in comparison with those of other human and bat co ##vs . results . ser ##olo ##gic and neutral ##ization responses against the spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein were primarily strain specific , with a very low level of cross - react ##ivity within or across subgroup ##s . co ##v n proteins within but not across subgroup ##s share cross - reactive ep ##ito ##pes with mer ##s - co ##v isolate ##s . our findings were valid ##ated using a con ##vale ##scent - phase serum specimen from a patient infected with mer ##s - co ##v ( na 01 ) and human anti ##ser ##um against sar ##s - co ##v , human co ##v nl ##6 ##3 , and human co ##v o ##c ##43 . conclusions . vaccine design for emerging co ##vs should involve chi ##meric spike protein containing neutral ##izing ep ##ito ##pes from multiple virus strains across subgroup ##s to reduce immune pathology , and a diagnostic platform should include a panel of nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and spike proteins from phylogenetic ##ally distinct co ##vs .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a zoo ##not ##ic viral disease that can be transmitted from dr ##ome ##dar ##ies to human beings . more than 1500 cases of mer ##s have been reported in human beings to date . although mer ##s has been associated with 30 % case fatal ##ity in human beings , mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies is usually as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic . in rare cases , dr ##ome ##dar ##ies may develop mild respiratory signs . no mer ##s - co ##v or antibodies against the virus have been detected in camel ##ids other than dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . mer ##s - co ##v is mainly acquired in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies when they are less than 1 year of age , and the proportion of ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity increases with age to a ser ##op ##re ##vale ##nce of 100 % in adult dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . laboratory diagnosis of mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies can be achieved through virus isolation using ve ##ro cells , rna detection by real - time quantitative reverse transcript ##ase - pc ##r and antigen detection using respiratory specimens or serum . rapid nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id antigen detection using a lateral flow platform allows efficient screening of dr ##ome ##dar ##ies carrying mer ##s - co ##v . in addition to mer ##s - co ##v , which is a lineage c virus in the beta ##cor ##ona ##virus ( beta ##co ##v ) genus , a lineage b beta ##co ##v and a virus in the alpha ##cor ##ona ##virus ( alpha ##co ##v ) genus have been detected in dr ##ome ##dar ##ies . dr ##ome ##dar ##y co ##v uae - hk ##u ##23 is closely related to human co ##v o ##c ##43 , whereas the alpha ##co ##v has not been detected in human beings to date .  
abstract sar ##s - like corona ##virus ( sl - co ##v ) in bats have a similar gen ##omic organization to the human sar ##s - co ##v . their co ##gna ##te gene products are highly conserved with the exception of the n - terminal region of the s proteins , which have only 63 – 64 % sequence identity . the n - terminal region of corona ##virus s protein is responsible for virus – receptor interaction . in this study , the im ##mun ##ogenic ##ity of the sl - co ##v s protein ( ss ##l ) was studied and compared with that of sar ##s - co ##v ( ss ##ars ) . dna im ##mun ##ization in mice with ss ##l eli ##cite ##d a high ti ##ter of antibodies against hiv - pseudo ##type ##d ss ##l . the sera had low cross - react ##ivity , but no neutral ##ization activity , for the hiv - pseudo ##type ##d ss ##ars . studies using wild bat sera revealed that it is highly likely that the im ##mun ##od ##omi ##nant ep ##ito ##pes overlap with the major neutral ##izing sites of the sl - co ##v s protein . these results demonstrated that sl - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v shared only a limited number of im ##mun ##ogenic ep ##ito ##pes in their s proteins and the major neutral ##ization ep ##ito ##pes are substantially different . this work provides useful information for future development of differential ser ##olo ##gic diagnosis and vaccines for corona ##virus ##es with different s protein sequences .  
abstract this article sum ##mar ##izes progress in research on middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) since a fa ##o - o ##ie - who global technical meeting held at who headquarters in geneva on 25 – 27 september 2017 . the meeting reviewed the latest scientific findings and identified and prior ##iti ##zed the global activities necessary to prevent , manage and control the disease . critical needs for research and technical guidance identified during the meeting have been used to update the who r & d mer ##s - co ##v road ##ma ##p for diagnostic ##s , therapeutic ##s and vaccines and a broader public health research agenda . since the 2017 meeting , progress has been made on several key actions in animal populations , at the animal / human interface and in human populations . this report also sum ##mar ##izes the latest scientific studies on mer ##s since 2017 , including data from more than 50 research studies examining the presence of mer ##s - co ##v infection in dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s .  
abstract background : the et ##iol ##og ##ic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is a recently identified , positive single - stranded rna ( ssr ##na ) corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . little is known about the dynamic changes of the viral replica ##tive form in sar ##s cases . objectives : evaluate whether sar ##s - co ##v can in ##fect and replicate in peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells ( p ##bm ##cs ) of infected persons and reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease . study design : peripheral blood mono ##nu ##cle ##ar cells collected from sar ##s cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative - stranded rna ( minus - rna , “ replica ##tive intermediate ##s ” ) and positive - stranded rna ( gen ##omic rna ) of sar ##s - co ##v during the course of hospital ##ization by reverse transcription - polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) . results : sar ##s - co ##v minus - rna was detected in p ##bm ##cs from sar ##s patients . the viral replica ##tive forms in p ##bm ##cs were detect ##able during a period of 6 days post - onset of the disease , while the plus - rna were detect ##able for a longer period ( 8 – 12 days post - onset ) . conclusions : sar ##s - corona ##virus can in ##fect and replicate within p ##bm ##cs of sar ##s patients , but viral replication in p ##bm ##cs seems subject to self - limitation .  
abstract in the corona ##virus ( co ##v ) , the envelope spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is responsible for co ##v cell entry and host - to - host transmission . the s is a multi ##fu ##nction ##al g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein that media ##tes both attachment of co ##v particles to cell surface receptor molecules as well as membrane penetration by fusion . receptor - binding domains ( rb ##d ) have been identified in the s of diverse co ##v ; they usually contain antigen ##ic deter ##mina ##nts targeted by antibodies that neutral ##ize co ##v infections . to penetrate host cells , the co ##v can use various cell surface molecules , although they prefer ##ential ##ly bind to ec ##to ##en ##zy ##mes . several crystal structures have determined the folding of co ##v rb ##d and the mode by which they recognize cell entry receptors . here we review the co ##v – receptor complex structures reported to date , and highlight the distinct receptor recognition modes , common features , and key deter ##mina ##nts of the binding specific ##ity . structural studies have established the basis for understanding receptor recognition diversity in co ##v , its evolution and the adaptation of this virus family to different hosts . co ##v responsible for recent outbreak ##s have extraordinary potential for cross - species transmission ; their rb ##d bear large platforms specialized in recognition of receptors from different species , which facilitates host - to - host circulation and adaptation to man .  
abstract the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) pan ##de ##mic revealed that zoo ##not ##ic transmission of animal corona ##virus ##es ( co ##v ) to humans poses a significant threat to public health and warrant ##s surveillance and the development of counter ##me ##as ##ures . the activity of host cell pro ##tea ##ses , which cl ##ea ##ve and activate the sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein , is essential for viral in ##fect ##ivity and constitutes a target for intervention . however , the identities of the pro ##tea ##ses involved have been unclear . pioneer studies identified cat ##he ##ps ##ins and type ii trans ##me ##mb ##rane ser ##ine pro ##tea ##ses as cellular act ##iva ##tors of sar ##s - co ##v and demonstrated that several emerging viruses might exploit these enzymes to promote their spread . here , we will review the pro ##te ##ol ##ytic systems hi ##jack ##ed by sar ##s - co ##v for s protein activation , we will discuss their contribution to viral spread in the host and we will outline anti ##vira ##l strategies targeting these enzymes . this paper forms part of a series of invited articles in anti ##vira ##l research on “ from sar ##s to mer ##s : 10 ##year ##s of research on highly pathogen ##ic human corona ##virus ##es . ’ ’ 
abstract we have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that genetic pre ##dis ##position influences the progression of sar ##s . ang ##iot ##ens ##in converting enzyme ( ace ##1 ) insertion / del ##eti ##on ( i / d ) poly ##morphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome , which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in sar ##s cases . this time , the poly ##morphism was gen ##otype ##d in 44 vietnamese sar ##s cases , with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the sar ##s patients and 50 controls without any contact history . sar ##s cases were divided into either non - h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c or h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c groups . despite the small sample size , the frequency of the d all ##ele was significantly higher in the h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c group than in the non - h ##yp ##ox ##emi ##c group ( p = 0 . 01 ##3 ) , whereas there was no significant difference between the sar ##s cases and controls , ir ##res ##pe ##ctive of a contact history . ace ##1 might be one of the candidate genes that influence the progression of pneumonia in sar ##s .  
abstract the 2019 - nc ##ov is officially called sar ##s - co ##v - 2 and the disease is named co ##vid - 19 . this viral epidemic in china has led to the deaths of over 1800 people , mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressed state . this is the third serious corona ##virus outbreak in less than 20 years , following sar ##s in 2002 – 2003 and mer ##s in 2012 . while human strains of corona ##virus are associated with about 15 % of cases of the common cold , the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 may present with varying degrees of severity , from flu - like symptoms to death . it is currently believed that this deadly corona ##virus strain originated from wild animals at the hua ##nan market in wu ##han , a city in hub ##ei province . bats , snakes and pang ##olin ##s have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homo ##logy of co ##v isolated from these animals and the viral nuclei ##c acids of the virus isolated from sar ##s - co ##v - 2 infected patients . extreme qu ##aran ##tine measures , including sealing off large cities , closing borders and con ##fin ##ing people to their homes , were instituted in january 2020 to prevent spread of the virus , but by that time much of the damage had been done , as human - human transmission became evident . while these qu ##aran ##tine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the spanish flu , earlier recognition and earlier implementation of qu ##aran ##tine measures may have been even more effective . lessons learned from sar ##s resulted in faster determination of the nuclei ##c acid sequence and a more robust qu ##aran ##tine strategy . however , it is clear that finding an effective anti ##vira ##l and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges . the costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects , as the virus has led to significant sociological , psychological and economic effects globally . unfortunately , emergence of sar ##s - co ##v - 2 has led to numerous reports of asian ##s being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world .  
abstract a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is being intensive ##ly pursued against its re - emergence . we generated a sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) spike protein - expressing rec ##om ##bina ##nt va ##cci ##nia virus ( rv ##v - s ) using highly at ##ten ##uated strain lc ##16 ##m ##8 . intra ##der ##mal administration of rv ##v - s into rabbits induced neutral ##izing ( nt ) antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v 1 week after administration and the nt ti ##ter reached 1 : 1000 after boost im ##mun ##ization with rv ##v - s . significantly , nt antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v were induced by administration of rv ##v - s to rabbits that had been pre - im ##mun ##ized with lc ##16 ##m ##8 . rv ##v - s can induce nt antibodies against sar ##s - co ##v despite the presence of nt antibodies against v ##v . these results suggest that rv ##v - s may be a powerful sar ##s vaccine , including in patients previously im ##mun ##ized with the smallpox vaccine .  
rapid diagnostic ##s , vaccines and therapeutic ##s are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) outbreak . it is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions , including those for middle east respiratory syndrome - corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v , to guide policy ##makers globally on their prior ##iti ##zation of resources for research and development . a systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases ( pub ##med , em ##base and cochrane library ) to identify published studies in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses ( prism ##a ) guidelines . supplementary strategies through google search and personal communications were used . a total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review . several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019 - nc ##ov cases using real - time reverse transcription polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) have been published . a commercial rt - pc ##r kit developed by the beijing gen ##omic institute is currently widely used in china and likely in asia . however , ser ##ological ass ##ays as well as point - of - care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future . several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline . the likely earliest phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic dna - based candidate . a number of novel compounds as well as therapeutic ##s licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019 - nc ##ov . some are being tested in clinical trials against mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v , while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019 - nc ##ov . however , there are currently no effective specific anti ##vira ##ls or drug combinations supported by high - level evidence .  
abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) , a life - threatening disease , is caused by the newly identified virus sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in order to study the spike ( s ) protein of this highly con ##tag ##ious virus , we established a cl ##onal cell - line , cho - sg , from the chinese ham ##ster o ##vary cells that stab ##ly expresses c - terminal ##ly e ##gf ##p - tagged sar ##s - co ##v s protein ( s - e ##gf ##p ) . the ec ##to ##dom ##ain of the s g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein is localized on the surface of cho - sg cells with n - ace ##ty ##l - g ##lu ##cos ##amine - terminated car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te structure . cho - sg cells associated tightly with ve ##ro e ##6 cells , a sar ##s - co ##v receptor ( ace ##2 ) expressing cell - line , and the interaction remained stable under highly string ##ent condition ( 1 ##m na ##cl ) . this interaction could be blocked by either the serum from a sar ##s con ##vale ##scent patient or a goat anti - ace ##2 antibody , indicating that the interaction is specific . a binding ep ##ito ##pe with lesser degree of g ##ly ##cos ##yla ##tion and native conform ##ation was localized by using rabbit anti - sera raised against five den ##at ##ured rec ##om ##bina ##nt s protein fragments expressed in es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli . one of the sera obtained from the fragment encompassing amino acids 48 - 35 ##8 significantly blocked the interaction between cho - sg and ve ##ro e ##6 cells . the region is useful for studying neutral ##izing antibodies in future vaccine development . this paper describes an easy and safe cell - based ass ##ay suitable for studying the binding between sar ##s - co ##v s protein and its receptor .  
abstract the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) is a lethal zoo ##nosis caused by mer ##s corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) and poses a significant threat to public health worldwide . therefore , a rapid , sensitive , and specific ser ##olo ##gic test for detecting anti - mer ##s - co ##v antibodies in both humans and animals is urgently needed for the successful management of this illness . here , we evaluated various novel lucifer ##ase im ##mun ##oso ##rb ##ent ass ##ays ( lisa ) based on nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id protein ( np ) as well as fragments derived from spike protein ( s ) including subunit 1 ( s ##1 ) , n terminal domain ( nt ##d ) , receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) and subunit 2 ( s ##2 ) of s for the detection of mer ##s - co ##v - specific i ##gg . fusion proteins , including nano ##lu ##ci ##fera ##se ( nl ##uc ) and various fragments derived from the np or s protein of mer ##s - co ##v , were expressed in human embryo ##nic kidney 293 t cells . lisa ##s that detected anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg were further developed using cell l ##ys ##ates expressing various fusion proteins . panels of human or animal samples infected with mer ##s - co ##v were used to analyze the sensitivity and specific ##ity of various lisa ##s in reference to a mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r , commercial s ##1 - based elisa , and pseudo ##virus particle neutral ##ization test ( pp ##nt ) . our results showed that the s ##1 - , rb ##d - , and np - lisa ##s were more sensitive than the nt ##d - and s ##2 - lisa ##s for the detection of anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg . furthermore , the s ##1 - , rb ##d - , and np - lisa ##s were more sensitive ( by at least 16 - fold ) than the commercially available s ##1 - elisa . moreover , the s ##1 - , rb ##d - , and np - lisa specifically recognized anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg and did not cross - react with samples derived from other human co ##v ( o ##c ##43 , 229 ##e , hk ##u ##1 , nl ##6 ##3 ) - infected patients . more importantly , these lisa ##s proved their app ##lica ##bility and reliability for detecting anti - mer ##s - co ##v i ##gg in samples from camel ##s , monkeys , and mice , among which the rb ##d - lisa exhibited excellent performance . the results of this study suggest that the novel mer ##s - co ##v rb ##d - and s ##1 - lisa ##s are highly effective platforms for the rapid and sensitive detection
abstract background the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) emerged in 2012 and attracted an international attention as the virus caused multiple healthcare associated outbreak ##s . there are reports of the role of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals in the transmission of mer ##s - co ##v , however , the exact role is not known . method the med ##line / pub ##med and sc ##opus databases were searched for relevant papers published till august 2018 describing as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s - co ##v infection . results a total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review . the extent of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s infection had increased with change in the policy of testing as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic contacts . in early cases in april 2012 – october 2013 , 12 . 5 % were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic among 144 pc ##r laboratory - confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25 . 1 % among 255 confirmed cases . the proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic cases reported among pediatric confirmed mer ##s - co ##v cases were higher ( 41 . 9 % – 81 . 8 % ) . overall , the detection rate of mer ##s infection among as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic contacts was 1 - 3 . 9 % in studies included in this review . as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases . of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic with no clear explanation . conclusions the proportion of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic mer ##s cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime . those patients were less likely to have como ##rb ##id disease and may contribute to the transmission of the virus .  
replication of corona ##virus ##es is inhibit ##ed in vitro by cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a , a well - known im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive drug which binds to cellular cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##ins thus ina ##ct ##ivating their en ##zy ##matic cis - trans pep ##ti ##dy ##l - pro ##ly ##l iso ##mer ##ase function . latter is required for proper folding of cellular proteins and of proteins of several viruses . here , we sum ##mar ##ize present knowledge on the role of cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a during corona ##virus replication . we present data on the effect of cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a single nu ##cle ##otide poly ##morphism mutants on the replication of human co ##v - 229 ##e demonstrating the requirement of proper cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a function for virus propagation . results define cellular cy ##cl ##op ##hil ##in a as a host target for inhibition of corona ##virus ##es ranging from relatively mild common cold to highly pathogen ##ic sar ##s - co ##v and mer ##s - co ##v viruses with the perspective of disc ##los ##ing non - im ##mun ##os ##up ##pressive cy ##cl ##os ##por ##in a analog ##s to broadly ina ##ct ##ivate the corona ##virus family .  
a novel lineage c beta ##cor ##ona ##virus , originally named human corona ##virus em ##c / 2012 ( hc ##ov - em ##c ) and recently renamed middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , that is phylogenetic ##ally closely related to ty ##lon ##y ##cter ##is bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##4 and pip ##ist ##rell ##us bat corona ##virus hk ##u ##5 , which we discovered in 2007 from bats in hong kong , has recently emerged in the middle east to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - like infection in humans . the first laboratory - confirmed case , which involved a 60 - year - old man from bis ##ha , the kingdom of saudi arabia ( ks ##a ) , who died of rapidly progressive community - acquired pneumonia and acute renal failure , was announced by the world health organization ( who ) on september 23 , 2012 . since then , a total of 70 cases , including 39 fatalities , have been reported in the middle east and europe . recent clusters involving ep ##ide ##mi ##ological ##ly - linked household contacts and hospital contacts in the middle east , europe , and africa strongly suggested possible human - to - human transmission . clinical and laboratory research data generated in the past few months have provided new insights into the possible animal reservoirs , trans ##mis ##sibility , and vi ##ru ##lence of mer ##s - co ##v , and the optimal laboratory diagnostic options and potential anti ##vira ##l targets for mer ##s - co ##v - associated infection .  
summary objectives the aim of this study was to review the ep ##ide ##mi ##ology of cases of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) reported in the kingdom of saudi arabia from 2012 when the first mer ##s - co ##v was confirmed up to july 2015 . methods mer ##s - co ##v data were obtained from the saudi ministry of health for the period 2012 to july 2015 . descriptive statistics were used to sum ##mar ##ize the results regarding the risk factors and mortality of mer ##s - co ##v infection . results in this series , the risk factors and outcomes of 93 ##9 cases of mer ##s - co ##v occurring in the last 3 years are described . the majority of the affected patients were aged ≥ ##40 years ( n = 65 ##7 ; 70 % ) . of the 65 ##7 patients aged ≥ ##40 years , 37 ##7 ( 57 . 3 % ) died . conclusions the case - fatal ##ity ratio was found to increase significantly with age . it ranged from 12 . 5 % in those aged ≤ ##19 years to 86 . 2 % in those aged ≥ ##80 years . the results confirmed the association between severe mer ##s - co ##v illness and patients with a pre - existing health mor ##bid ##ity . the duration from sy ##mpt ##om onset to admission was not statistical ##ly associated with the disease outcome .  
abstract clinical detection of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) in patients is achieved using genetic diagnostic methods , such as real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay . previously , we developed a reverse transcription - loop - mediated iso ##thermal amp ##li ##fication ( rt - lamp ) ass ##ay for the detection of mer ##s - co ##v [ vi ##rol j . 2014 . 11 : 139 ] . generally , amp ##li ##fication of rt - lamp is monitored by the tu ##rb ##idi ##ty induced by precipitation of magnesium p ##yr ##op ##hos ##phate with newly synthesized dna . however , this mechanism cannot completely exclude the possibility of unexpected reactions . therefore , in this study , fluorescent rt - lamp ass ##ays using que ##nch ##ing probe ##s ( q ##pro ##bes ) were developed specifically to monitor only prime ##r - derived signals . two prime ##r sets ( targeting nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id and or ##f ##1 ##a sequences ) were constructed to confirm mer ##s cases by rt - lamp ass ##ay only . our data indicate that both prime ##r sets were capable of detecting mer ##s - co ##v rna to the same level as existing genetic diagnostic methods , and that both were highly specific with no cross - react ##ivity observed with other respiratory viruses . these prime ##r sets were highly efficient in amp ##li ##fying target sequences derived from different mer ##s - co ##v strains , including camel mer ##s - co ##v . in addition , the detection efficacy of q ##pro ##be rt - lamp was comparable to that of real - time rt - pc ##r ass ##ay using clinical specimens from patients in saudi arabia . altogether , these results indicate that q ##pro ##be rt - lamp ass ##ays described here can be used as powerful diagnostic tools for rapid detection and surveillance of mer ##s - co ##v infections .  
abstract effective anti ##vira ##l treatments for mer ##s - co ##v are urgently needed . lc ##a ##60 is a mer ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing mono ##cl ##onal antibody isolated from a con ##vale ##scent mer ##s patient . previously , it was shown that treatment with lc ##a ##60 resulted in reduced disease and virus ti ##ters in mouse models of mer ##s - co ##v infection . here , we tested the prop ##hyl ##actic efficacy of lc ##a ##60 in the common mar ##mos ##et model of mer ##s - co ##v infection . intra ##ven ##ous administration of lc ##a ##60 one day before virus challenge resulted in high levels of mer ##s - co ##v - neutral ##izing activity in circulating blood . clinical ##ly , there was a moderate benefit of treatment with lc ##a ##60 including reduced respiratory involvement . although viral lung loads were not reduced in lc ##a ##60 - treated animals as compared to controls , there were fewer path ##ological changes in the lungs . thus , prop ##hyl ##actic lc ##a ##60 treatment could be implemented to reduce disease burden in contacts of confirmed mer ##s - co ##v patients .  
the middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has been recognized as a highly pathogen ##ic virus that in ##fect ##s the human respiratory tract and has high mor ##bid ##ity and mortality . the mer ##s - co ##v is a huge burden on saudi arabian health - care facilities , causing approximately 40 % mortality . the transmission mechanism of the virus is still not well understood . therefore , the prevention of any route of transmission is the best measure to arrest the spread of this disease . using the real time polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rt - pc ##r ) , mer ##s - co ##v was detected in the nasal secret ##ions of a human cad ##aver . full precautions should be applied and carefully followed to prevent the transmission of the virus , especially among health care workers .  
summary introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) caused large outbreak ##s of at ##yp ##ical pneumonia in 2003 , with the largest localized outbreak occurring in beijing , china . l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia was prominent amongst the laboratory abnormalities reported in acute sar ##s . methods the effect of sar ##s on peripheral blood l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes and their subset ##s was examined in 271 sar ##s corona ##virus - infected individuals . results there was a significant decrease in the cd ##45 + , cd ##3 + , cd ##4 + , cd ##8 + , cd ##19 + and cd ##16 + / 56 + cell counts over the five weeks of the sar ##s illness although cd ##4 + / cd ##8 + ratios did not change significantly . the l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia was prolonged , reaching a nad ##ir during days 7 – 9 in the second week of illness before returning towards normal after five weeks , with the lowest mean cd ##4 + cell count of 317 cells ##× ##10 ##6 / l at day 7 , and cd ##8 + cell count of 239 cells ##× ##10 ##6 / l at day 8 . patients with more severe clinical illness , or patients who died , had significantly more profound cd ##4 + and cd ##8 + l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia . discussion l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia is a prominent part of sar ##s - co ##v infection and l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte counts may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes . possible reasons for the sar ##s - associated l ##ym ##ph ##open ##ia may be direct infection of l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes by sar ##s - co ##v , l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte se ##quest ##ration in the lung or cy ##tok ##ine - mediated l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte trafficking . there may also be immune - mediated l ##ym ##ph ##oc ##yte destruction , bone marrow or thy ##mus suppression , or ap ##op ##tosis .

abstract we have expressed a series of truncated spike ( s ) g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s of sar ##s - co ##v and found that the n - terminus 14 – 50 ##2 residual ##s were sufficient to bind to sar ##s - co ##v susceptible ve ##ro e ##6 cells . with this soluble s protein fragment as an affinity ligand , we screened he ##la cells trans ##duced with retro ##vira ##l cd ##na library from ve ##ro e ##6 cells and obtained a he ##la cell clone which could bind with the s protein . this cell clone was susceptible to hiv / sar ##s pseudo ##virus infection and the presence of a functional receptor for s protein in this cell clone was confirmed by the cell – cell fusion ass ##ay . further studies showed the su ##sc ##ept ##ibility of this cell was due to the expression of end ##ogen ##ous ang ##iot ##ens ##in - converting enzyme 2 ( ace ##2 ) which was activated by inserted lt ##r from retro ##vira ##l vector used for expression cl ##oning . when human ace ##2 cd ##na was trans ##duced into ni ##h ##3 ##t ##3 cells , the ace ##2 expressing ni ##h ##3 ##t ##3 cells could be infected with hiv / sar ##s pseudo ##virus . these data clearly demonstrated that ace ##2 was the functional receptor for sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract we sum ##mar ##ize findings of sar ##s - co ##v infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by his ##top ##ath ##ological changes and / or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees . new findings are reported on sar ##s - co ##v replication and associated pathology in two additional strains ( c ##57 ##bl / 6 and 129 ##s ##6 ) of aged mice . we also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden syrian ham ##sters with various sar ##s - co ##v strains and report the levels of neutral ##izing antibody ti ##ters following these infections and the cross - protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against het ##ero ##log ##ous challenge . finally , we sum ##mar ##ize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re - infection in animals previously va ##cci ##nated against or infected with sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract sar ##s - co ##v entry is mediated by spike g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein . during the viral and host cellular membrane fusion , hr ##1 and hr ##2 form 6 - helix bundle , positioning the fusion peptide closely to the c - terminal region of ec ##to ##dom ##ain to drive app ##osition and subsequent membrane fusion . connecting to the hr ##2 region is a tr ##p - rich region which is absolutely conserved in members of corona ##virus ##es . to investigate the importance of tr ##p - rich region in sar ##s - co ##v entry , we produced different mu ##tated s proteins using alan ##ine scan strategy . sar ##s - co ##v pseudo ##type ##d with mu ##tated s protein was used to measure viral in ##fect ##ivity . to restore the aromatic ##ity of ala - mutants , we performed rescue experiments using ph ##en ##yla ##lani ##ne substitution ##s . our results show that individually substituted ala - mutants substantially decrease in ##fect ##ivity by > 90 % , global ala - mutants totally ab ##rogated in ##fect ##ivity . in contrast , ph ##e - substituted mutants are able to restore 10 – 25 % in ##fect ##ivity comparing to the wild - type . the results suggest that the tr ##p - rich region of s protein is essential for sar ##s - co ##v in ##fect ##ivity .  
middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) still causes outbreak ##s despite public awareness and implementation of health care measures , such as rapid viral diagnosis and patient qu ##aran ##tine . here we describe the current ep ##ide ##mi ##ological picture of mer ##s - co ##v , focusing on humans and animals affected by this virus and propose specific intervention strategies that would be appropriate to control mer ##s - co ##v . one - third of mer ##s - co ##v patients develop severe lower respiratory tract infection and su ##cc ##umb to a fatal outcome ; these patients would require effective therapeutic anti ##vira ##l therapy . because of the lack of such intervention strategies , supportive care is the best that can be offered at the moment . limiting viral spread from sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic human cases to health care workers and family members , on the other hand , could be achieved through prop ##hyl ##actic administration of mer ##s - co ##v neutral ##izing antibodies and vaccines . to ultimately prevent spread of the virus into the human population , however , va ##cci ##nation of dr ##ome ##dar ##y camel ##s – currently the only confirmed animal host for mer ##s - co ##v – may be the best option to achieve a sustained drop in human mer ##s cases in time . in the end , a one health approach combining all these different efforts is needed to tackle this zoo ##not ##ic outbreak .  
abstract continuous efforts have been made to develop a prop ##hyl ##actic vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) . in this study , two rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus ##es , va ##c - n and va ##c - s , were constructed , which contained the mammalian - cell activate promoter element , human el ##onga ##tion factor 1 ##α - subunit ( e ##f - 1 ##α ) , the human cy ##tom ##ega ##lov ##irus ( cm ##v ) immediate - early promoter , and the nu ##cle ##oca ##ps ##id ( n ) or spike ( s ) gene of bat sar ##s - like co ##v ( sl - co ##v ) under the control of the cm ##v promoter . mice were sub ##cut ##aneous ##ly and intra ##per ##ito ##nea ##lly injected with rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus , and both humor ##al and cellular immune responses were induced in the va ##cci ##nated groups . the secret ##ion level of if ##n - γ was much higher than that of il - 4 in va ##c - n or va ##c - s im ##mun ##ized groups , suggesting a strong th ##1 bias towards cellular immune responses . additionally , a marked increase of cd ##4 t cell immune responses and high levels of anti - sar ##s - co ##v humor ##al responses were also detected in the va ##c - n or va ##c - s im ##mun ##ized groups . in contrast , there were significantly weaker cellular immune responses , as well as less antibody production than in the control groups . our data demonstrates that the rec ##om ##bina ##nt ba ##cu ##lov ##irus can serve as an effective vaccine strategy . in addition , because effective sar ##s vaccines should act to not only prevent the re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of sar ##s - co ##v , but also to provide cross - protection against sl - co ##v , findings in this study may have implications for developing such cross - protective vaccines .  
abstract mer ##s - co ##v is the only lethal human co ##v still endemic in the arabian peninsula and neither vaccine nor therapeutic ##s against mer ##s - co ##v infection is available . the ns ##p ##1 of co ##v is thought to be a major vi ##ru ##lence factor because it suppress ##es protein synthesis through the degradation of host mrna . in contrast , viral rna ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##s the ns ##p ##1 - mediated translation ##al shut ##off for an efficient propagation . in this study , we identified amino acid residue in mer ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 that differ from those of sar ##s - co ##v ns ##p ##1 , and that appear to be crucial for ci ##rc ##um ##venting the translation ##al shut ##off . in addition , reverse genetics analysis suggested the presence of a cis - acting element at the 5 ′ - terminus of the ns ##p ##1 - coding region , which contributes to the specific recognition of viral rna that is required for an efficient viral replication . our results suggest the co ##vs share a common mechanism for ci ##rc ##um ##venting the ns ##p ##1 - mediated translation ##al shut ##off .  
abstract middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) has emerged as a corona ##virus infection of humans in the past 5 years . though confined to certain geographical regions of the world , infection has been associated with a case fatal ##ity rate of 35 % , and this mortality may be higher in vent ##ila ##ted patients . as there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease , it has been a challenge to ethical ##ly determine what opt ##imum treatment strategies can be used for this disease . we used in - vitro and human ex - vivo ex ##pl ##ant cultures to investigate the effect of two im ##mun ##omo ##du ##lat ##ory agents , inter ##fer ##on alpha and cy ##cl ##os ##por ##ine , sing ##ly and in combination , on mer ##s - co ##v replication . in both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing mer ##s - co ##v replication . pc ##r super ##ar ##ray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of inter ##fer ##on stimulated genes . as these therapeutic agents are already licensed for clinical use , it may be relevant to investigate their use for therapy of human mer ##s - co ##v infection .  
abstract the recent identification of a novel human corona ##virus responsible of a sar ##s - like illness in the middle - east a decade after the sar ##s pan ##de ##mic , demonstrates that re ##eme ##rgen ##ce of a sar ##s - like corona ##virus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat . because sar ##s is contracted by aero ##sol ##ized contamination of the respiratory tract , a vaccine inducing mu ##cos ##al long - term protection would be an asset to control new epidemic ##s . to this aim , we generated live at ##ten ##uated rec ##om ##bina ##nt me ##as ##les vaccine ( mv ) candidates expressing either the membrane - anchored sar ##s - co ##v spike ( s ) protein or its secret ##ed soluble ec ##to ##dom ##ain ( ss ##ol ) . in mice susceptible to me ##as ##les virus , rec ##om ##bina ##nt mv expressing the anchored full - length s induced the highest ti ##ters of neutral ##izing antibodies and fully protected im ##mun ##ized animals from intra ##nas ##al infectious challenge with sar ##s - co ##v . as compared to im ##mun ##ization with ad ##ju ##vant ##ed rec ##om ##bina ##nt ss ##ol protein , rec ##om ##bina ##nt mv induced stronger and th ##1 - biased responses , a hallmark of live at ##ten ##uated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an anti ##vira ##l vaccine .  
abstract since discovery of middle east respiratory syndrome corona ##virus ( mer ##s - co ##v ) , a novel beta ##cor ##ona ##virus first isolated and characterized in 2012 , mer ##s - co ##v real - time reverse transcript ##ase polymer ##ase chain reaction ( rr ##t - pc ##r ) ass ##ays represent one of the most rapidly expanding commercial tests . however , in the absence of extensive evaluation ##s of these ass ##ays on positive clinical material of different sources , evaluating their diagnostic effectiveness remains challenging . we describe the diagnostic performance evaluation of 3 common commercial mer ##s - co ##v rr ##t - pc ##r ass ##ays on a large panel ( n = 234 ) of upper respiratory tract specimens collected during an outbreak episode in saudi arabia . ass ##ays were compared to the real ##star ##® mer ##s - co ##v rt - pc ##r ( alton diagnostic ##s , hamburg , germany ) ass ##ay as the gold standard . results showed i ) the ti ##b mo ##lb ##iol ##® light ##mi ##x up ##e and or ##f ##1 ##a ass ##ays ( ti ##b mo ##lb ##iol , berlin , germany ) to be the most sensitive , followed by ii ) the any ##plex ##™ see ##gen ##e mer ##s - co ##v ass ##ay ( see ##gen ##e , seoul , korea ) , and finally iii ) the prime ##rdes ##ign ##™ genes ##ig ##® hc ##ov _ 2012 ass ##ay ( prime ##rdes ##ign , england , united kingdom ) . we also evaluate a modified protocol for the prime ##rdes ##ign ##™ genes ##ig ##® hc ##ov _ 2012 ass ##ay .  
the newly identified 2019 novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) has caused more than 11 , 900 laboratory - confirmed human infections , including 259 deaths , posing a serious threat to human health . currently , however , there is no specific anti ##vira ##l treatment or vaccine . considering the relatively high identity of receptor - binding domain ( rb ##d ) in 2019 - nc ##ov and sar ##s - co ##v , it is urgent to assess the cross - react ##ivity of anti - sar ##s co ##v antibodies with 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein , which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019 - nc ##ov . here , we report for the first time that a sar ##s - co ##v - specific human mono ##cl ##onal antibody , cr ##30 ##22 , could bind potent ##ly with 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d ( k ##d of 6 . 3 nm ) . the ep ##ito ##pe of cr ##30 ##22 does not overlap with the ace ##2 binding site within 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d . these results suggest that cr ##30 ##22 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutic ##s , alone or in combination with other neutral ##izing antibodies , for the prevention and treatment of 2019 - nc ##ov infections . interesting ##ly , some of the most potent sar ##s - co ##v - specific neutral ##izing antibodies ( e . g . m3 ##9 ##6 , cr ##30 ##14 ) that target the ace ##2 binding site of sar ##s - co ##v failed to bind 2019 - nc ##ov spike protein , implying that the difference in the rb ##d of sar ##s - co ##v and 2019 - nc ##ov has a critical impact for the cross - react ##ivity of neutral ##izing antibodies , and that it is still necessary to develop novel mono ##cl ##onal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019 - nc ##ov rb ##d .  
background : human infections with zoo ##not ##ic corona ##virus ##es ( co ##vs ) , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) - co ##v and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mer ##s ) - co ##v , have raised great public health concern globally . here , we report a novel bat - origin co ##v causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans . methods : we collected clinical data and bro ##nch ##oa ##l ##ve ##olar lava ##ge ( bal ) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from jin yin - tan hospital of wu ##han , hub ##ei province , china . nuclei ##c acids of the bal were extracted and subjected to next - generation sequencing . virus isolation was carried out , and maximum - likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed . results : five patients hospitalized from december 18 to december 29 , 2019 presented with fever , cough , and d ##ys ##p ##nea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome . chest radio ##graphy revealed diffuse op ##ac ##ities and consolidation . one of these patients died . sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown beta - co ##v strain in all five patients , with 99 . 8 - 99 . 9 % nu ##cle ##otide identities among the isolate ##s . these isolate ##s showed 79 . 0 % nu ##cle ##otide identity with the sequence of sar ##s - co ##v ( gen ##bank nc _ 00 ##47 ##18 ) and 51 . 8 % identity with the sequence of mer ##s - co ##v ( gen ##bank nc _ 01 ##9 ##8 ##43 ) . the virus is phylogenetic ##ally closest to a bat sar ##s - like co ##v ( sl - z ##c ##45 , gen ##bank mg ##7 ##7 ##29 ##33 ) with 87 . 6 - 87 . 7 % nu ##cle ##otide identity , but is in a separate clade . moreover , these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8 , as a further indicator of bat - origin co ##vs . however , the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor - binding domain resembles that of sar ##s - co ##v , indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor . conclusion : a novel bat - borne co ##v was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans .  
abstract recently , a novel corona ##virus ( 2019 - nc ##ov ) , officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona ##virus 2 ( sar ##s - co ##v - 2 ) , emerged in china . despite drastic containment measures , the spread of this virus is ongoing . sar ##s - co ##v - 2 is the ae ##ti ##ological agent of corona ##virus disease 2019 ( co ##vid - 19 ) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans . the efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for the ##ra ##pies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease . in the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public - health emergency , it made sense to investigate the possible effect of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e / hydro ##xy ##ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e against sar ##s - co ##v - 2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most corona ##virus ##es , including sar ##s - co ##v - 1 . preliminary trials of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e rep ##ur ##po ##sing in the treatment of co ##vid - 19 in china have been encouraging , leading to several new trials . here we discuss the possible mechanisms of ch ##lor ##o ##quin ##e interference with the sar ##s - co ##v - 2 replication cycle .  
abstract when severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) spread in vietnam in march 2003 , bach mai hospital ( b ##m ##h ) contributed greatly to putting sar ##s under control by conducting strict nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control . at b ##m ##h , technical guidance on nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control had been implemented by japanese experts since 2000 . in addition , after the sar ##s outbreak , the japan disaster relief team was dispatched to assist in sar ##s control at b ##m ##h . sar ##s control in vietnam was reviewed in reference to this technical guidance to investigate effective control measures . major subjects of the technical guidance included the establishment of a control system , development of manual ##s and teaching materials , training of medical staff , and supplying protective attire . b ##m ##h provided medical care for 35 sar ##s cases ; however , no nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection cases occurred leading to sar ##s containment . a swift reaction , effective nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control , proper advice by the ministry of health and other elements are considered important factors in the success of sar ##s containment at b ##m ##h . in addition , the fruit of technical cooperation conducted under the project is regarded , to no small extent , as having formed the basis for this . nos ##oco ##mia ##l infection control is a crucial factor in achieving high - quality medical care , as well as sar ##s control at the hospital level .  
abstract apart from bat - sar ##s - co ##v , we have identified a novel group 1 corona ##virus , bat - co ##v hk ##u ##2 , in rhino ##lo ##phus sin ##icus ( chinese horseshoe bats ) . since it has been suggested that the receptor - binding motif ( rb ##m ) of sar ##s - co ##v may have been acquired from a group 1 corona ##virus , we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat - sar ##s - co ##v and bat - co ##v hk ##u ##2 in 8 . 7 % and 7 . 5 % respectively of r . sin ##icus in hong kong and guangdong . complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat - co ##v hk ##u ##2 revealed the smallest corona ##virus genome ( 271 ##64 nu ##cle ##otide ##s ) and a unique spike protein evolution ##ari ##ly distinct from the rest of the genome . this spike protein , sharing similar del ##eti ##ons with other group 2 corona ##virus ##es in its c - terminus , also contained a 15 - amino acid peptide homo ##log ##ous to a corresponding peptide within the rb ##m of spike protein of sar ##s - co ##v , which was absent in other corona ##virus ##es except bat - sar ##s - co ##v . these suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat - co ##v hk ##u ##2 , bat - sar ##s - co ##v , and sar ##s - co ##v .  
abstract the viral pro ##tea ##ses have proven to be the most selective and useful for removing the fusion tags in fusion protein expression systems . as a key enzyme in the viral life - cycle , the main pro ##tea ##se ( mp ##ro ) is most attractive for drug design targeting the sar ##s corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) , the et ##iol ##ogical agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) in 2003 . in this study , sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro was used to specifically remove the gs ##t tag in a new fusion protein expression system . we report a new method to produce wild - type ( w ##t ) sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro with authentic n and c term ##ini , and compare the activity of w ##t pro ##tea ##se with those of three different types of sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro with additional residues at the n or c terminus . our results show that additional residues at the n terminus , but not at the c terminus , of mp ##ro are detrimental to enzyme activity . to explain this , the crystal structures of w ##t sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro and its complex with a michael accept ##or inhibitor were determined to 1 . 6 a and 1 . 95 a resolution respectively . these crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this pro ##tea ##se is important for sustaining the substrate - binding pocket and inhibitor binding . this study suggests that sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro could serve as a new tag - cleavage end ##ope ##pt ##ida ##se for protein over ##pro ##duction , and the w ##t sar ##s - co ##v mp ##ro is more appropriate for me ##chan ##istic characterization and inhibitor design .  
the envelope spike ( s ) proteins of mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v determine the virus host tr ##op ##ism and entry into host cells , and constitute a promising target for the development of prop ##hyl ##actic ##s and therapeutic ##s . here , we present high - resolution structures of the trim ##eric mer ##s - co ##v and sar ##s - co ##v s proteins in its pre - fusion conform ##ation by single particle cry ##o - electron microscopy . the overall structures resemble that from other corona ##virus ##es including hk ##u ##1 , m ##h ##v and nl ##6 ##3 reported recently , with the exception of the receptor binding domain ( rb ##d ) . we captured two states of the rb ##d with receptor binding region either buried ( lying state ) or exposed ( standing state ) , demonstrating an inherently flexible rb ##d readily recognized by the receptor . further sequence conservation analysis of six human - in ##fect ##ing corona ##virus ##es revealed that the fusion peptide , hr ##1 region and the central helix are potential targets for eli ##cit ##ing broadly neutral ##izing antibodies .  
summary introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sar ##s ) is an emerging infectious disease that first occurred in humans in the people ' s republic of china in november 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide . a novel virus belonging to the corona ##vir ##idae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease . the severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic ass ##ays . results a real - time quantitative rt - pc ##r was designed in the ns ##p ##11 region of the replica ##se 1b domain of the sar ##s - corona ##virus ( sar ##s - co ##v ) genome . to evaluate this quantitative rt - pc ##r , cr ##na standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of sar ##s - co ##v frankfurt 1 rna using t ##7 rna polymer ##ase , followed by real - time rt - pc ##r . the ass ##ay allowed quan ##ti ##tation over a range of 102 to 108 rna copies per reaction . conclusions extra ##pol ##ated to clinical samples , this novel ass ##ay has a detection range of 104 to 101 ##0 copies of viral genome equivalent ##s per mill ##ili ##tre . in comparison to the current de facto cr ##na art ##us bio ##tech standard , the in - house cr ##na standard gives a 100 - fold higher absolute quantity , suggesting a possible under ##est ##ima ##tion of the viral load when using the art ##us bio ##tech standard .
