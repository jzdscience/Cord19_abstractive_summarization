a b s t r a c t abortion and neonatal mortality are events that can occur in breeding bitches and queens it has been reported that up to 55% and 33% of these cases remain without a known cause respectively in canine and feline pregnancies unusual abortigenic and potentially zoonotic agents including coxiella burnetii and leptospira spp may be involved in these cases c burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in cattle sheep and goats and cases of abortion have been observed in dogs and cats moreover several outbreaks of c burnetii infection in humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens and some of these animals experienced abortion leptospira interrogans sensu lato is able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens the aim of this study was to search for c burnetii and leptospira spp dna in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline abortion stillbirth and neonatal mortality submitted for the identification of possible infectious agents one hundred and fifty-one specimens were tested using pcr assays and found negative for c burnetii and leptospira dna however in 49 samples 47.6% other infectious causes of abortion stillbirth and neonatal mortality were identified these results showed that c burnetii and leptospira spp are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths in dogs however given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of these agents surveillance of canine and feline abortion stillbirth and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation of these events
background although bats are natural reservoirs of many pathogens few studies have been conducted on the genetic variation and detection of selection in major histocompatibility complex mhc genes these genes are critical for resistance and susceptibility to diseases and host-pathogen interactions are major determinants of their extensive polymorphism here we examined spatial patterns of diversity of the expressed mhc class ii drb gene of three sympatric neotropical bats carollia perspicillata and desmodus rotundus phyllostomidae and molossus molossus molossidae all of which use the same environments e g forests edge habitats urban areas comparison with neutral marker mtdna d-loop diversity was performed at the same time results twenty-three drb alleles were identified in 19 c perspicillata 30 alleles in 35 d rotundus and 20 alleles in 28 m molossus the occurrence of multiple drb loci was found for the two phyllostomidae species the drb polymorphism was high in all sampling sites and different signatures of positive selection were detected depending on the environment the patterns of drb diversity were similar to those of neutral markers for c perspicillata and m molossus in contrast these patterns were different for d rotundus for which a geographical structure was highlighted a heterozygote advantage was also identified for this species no recombination or gene conversion event was found and phylogenetic relationships showed a trans-species mode of evolution in the phyllostomids conclusions this study of mhc diversity demonstrated the strength of the environment and contrasting pathogen pressures in shaping drb diversity differences between positively selected sites identified in bat species highlighted the potential role of gut microbiota in shaping immune responses furthermore multiple geographic origins and/or population admixtures observed in c perspicillata and m molossus populations acted as an additional force in shaping drb diversity in contrast drb diversity of d rotundus was shaped by environment rather than demographic history
seeds from 37 species of nama hydrophyllaceae were examined by scanning electron microscopy in order to assess systematic implications of seed coat structure generally seed coat morphology is species specific nevertheless similarities among species in seed coat organization particularly outer testa anatomy and wall thickening-pitting patterns allow the recognition of six groups among examined taxa furthermore seed coat features often suggest both intra-group and inter-group relationships recognized groupings do not correspond well with the more classicial treatments of nama rather they suggest that a restructuring of the infrageneric and even the generic taxonomy of nama is in order
most of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are of animal origin and transmitted under natural circumstances from either wild or domestic vertebrate animals giving the way of zoonotic infection or epidemics zoonotic diseases carry a common ancient history between human and animals as a result of pathogen exchanges involving transgression of the species barrier nowadays several agents have been targeted for their potential to be a major risk for human and animal populations and have been characterized by their potential to be highly pathogenic and/ or transmissible and lacking of any means of protection those agents have been listed as "select agents" having the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health as well as to animal and plant products several of the most dangerous agents responsible of viral hemorrhagic fever are review in this chapter including ebola virus marburg virus rift valley fever virus kyasanur forest virus omsk hemorrhagic fever virus alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus 1015
nipah virus niv is a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen in the genus henipavirus of the paramyxoviridae family of viruses niv is endemic to bangladesh and malaysia and is highly fatal to both livestock and humans human case fatality rate = 74.5%. currently there is no approved vaccine against niv on the market the goal of this study was to use a recombinant rabv vector expressing niv glycoprotein niv g to develop a bivalent candidate vaccine against niv disease and rabies virus rabv disease which is also a significant health burden in the regions where niv is endemic the rabies vector is a well-established vaccine strain that lacks neurovirulence and can stably expresses foreign antigens that are immunogenic in various animal models mice inoculated intranasally with the live recombinant rabv/niv vaccine niparab showed no signs of disease to test the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate groups of c57bl/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of live vaccine particles or two doses of chemically inactivated viral particles both vaccination groups showed niv g-specific seroconversion and the inactivated inac vaccine group yielded higher titers of niv g-specific antibodies furthermore cross-reactivity of niv g-specific immune sera against hendra virus hev was confirmed by immunofluorescence if and indirect elisa against soluble recombinant hev glycoprotein hev g both live and killed vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies these results indicate that niparab may be used as a killed virus vaccine to protect humans against niv and rabv and possibly as a preventative measure against hev as well npj vaccines 2019 415 https//doi
plant-made vaccines are now a well-established and well-tested concept in veterinary medicine-yet the only product so far licenced was never produced commercially this is puzzling given the breadth of exploration of plant-made animal vaccines and their immunogenicity and efficacy over more than twenty years of research the range of candidate vaccines that have been tested in laboratory animal models includes vaccines for e coli salmonella yersinia pestis foot and mouth disease virus rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus rabbit and canine and bovine papillomaviruses mink enteritis and porcine circovirus and lately also bluetongue virus among many others there are many proofs of efficacy of such vaccines and regulatory pathways appear to have been explored for their licencing this review will briefly explore the history of plant-made vaccines for use in animals and will discuss the unique advantages of plant-made vaccines for use in a veterinary medicine setting in detail with a proposal of their relevance within the "one health" paradigm
the successful therapeutic synergism of aprotinin and rimantadine which are known to attack different viral targets was demonstrated in influenza-virusinfected animals combined treatment with these drugs of mice infected with a highly lethal dose of mouse-adapted influenza virus prevented the development of fatal haemorrhagic pneumonia and protected about 75 % of animals whereas the separate administration of aprotinin and rimantadine induced 35 % and 15 % protection respectively
the rhabdoviridae is among the most diverse families of rna viruses and currently classified into 18 genera with some rhabdoviruses lethal to humans and other animals herein we describe genetic characterization of three novel rhabdoviruses from bats in china of these two viruses jinghong bat virus and benxi bat virus found in rhinolophus bats showed a phylogenetic relationship with vesiculoviruses and sequence analyses indicate that they represent two new species within the genus vesiculovirus the remaining yangjiang bat virus found in hipposideros larvatus bats were only distantly related to currently known rhabdoviruses
cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis are quickly becoming a useful model for infectious disease and transplantation research even though cynomolgus macaques from different geographic regions are used for these studies there has been limited characterization of full-length major histocompatibility complex mhc class i immunogenetics of distinct geographic populations here we identified 48 mhc class i cdna nucleotide sequences in eleven indonesian cynomolgus macaques including 41 novel mafa-a and mafa-b sequences we found seven mhc class i sequences in indonesian macaques that were identical to mhc class i sequences identified in malaysian or mauritian macaques sharing of nucleotide sequences between these geographically distinct populations is also consistent with the hypothesis that indonesia was a source of the mauritian macaque population in addition we found that the indonesian cdna sequence mafa-b*7601 is identical throughout its peptide binding domain to mamu-b*03 an allele that has been associated with control of siv viremia in indian rhesus macaques overall a better understanding of the mhc class i alleles present in indonesian cynomolgus macaques improves their value as a model for disease research and it better defines the biogeography of cynomolgus macaques throughout southeast asia
objectives a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like disease due to a novel betacoronavirus human coronavirus emc hcov-emc has emerged recently hcov-emc is phylogenetically closely related to tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-hku4 and pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-hku5 in hong kong we conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market 28 sars patients and 152 healthy blood * corresponding author journal of infection 2013 67 130e140 oc43 hku1 cross-reactive antibody neutralization seroprevalence donors in southern china to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of hcov-emc and related viruses into humans methods anti-hcov-emc and anti-sars-cov antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence if and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests results two 2.1% animal handlers had if antibody titer of 120 against both hcov-emc and sars-cov with neutralizing antibody titer of <110 no blood donor had antibody against either virus surprisingly 17/28 60.7% of sars patients had significant if antibody titers with 7/28 25% having anti-hcov-emc neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of hcov-oc43 bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant b-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of spike protein virulence of sars-cov over other betacoronaviruses may boost cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against other betacoronaviruses conclusions convalescent sars sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for hcov-emc
when we contract an infection we typically feel sick and behave accordingly symptoms of sickness behavior sb include anorexia hypersomnia depression and reduced social interactions sb affects species spanning from arthropods to vertebrates is triggered nonspecifically by viruses bacteria and parasites and is orchestrated by a complex network of cytokines and neuroendocrine pathways clearly it has been naturally selected nonetheless sb seems evolutionarily costly it promotes starvation and predation and reduces reproductive opportunities how could sb persist former explanations focused on individual fitness invoking improved resistance to pathogens could prevention of disease transmission propagating in populations through kin selection also contribute to sbsickness syndrome is the generalized response of the host to infections its classical physiological signs include fever and anemia but it also includes psychological symptoms-collectively termed "sickness behavior" sb . these symptoms familiar to anyone who has been sick include fatigue depression irritability discomfort pain nausea and loss of interest in food drink social interactions and sex in animals such changes can be quantified based on behavior and reflect reprioritization of motivations during disease .a common misconception is that pathogens directly produce these behavioral symptoms but in fact sb is orchestrated by the host's immune and neuroendocrine systems mammals have evolved several parallel pathways to alert the brain of inflammation and trigger symptomatic behaviors fig 1 .although the specificities may vary sb is widespread with respect to both pathogens and hosts diverse pathogens including viruses bacteria and protozoa can trigger it and equivalent behavioral responses characterize several vertebrate classes as well as arthropods . however when closely examined some genera exhibit significant variation in the extent of sb which to date remains unexplained since sb is a conserved phenomenon that is mediated by complex immunological and neuroendocrine pathways it clearly must have evolutionary benefits still in the last 25 years much plos biology |
background the current vaccines for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv have failed to provide broad protection against infection by various strains of prrsv porcine interleukin-4 pil-4 plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response and has been used previously as an immunological adjuvant the objective of this study was to construct a recombinant prrsv expressing pil-4 and to evaluate the immune response of the recombinant virus in piglets the pil-4 gene was inserted in the prrsv ch-1r strain infectious clone by overlap pcr indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa and western blotting were used to confirm the recombinant virus the stability of the recombinant virus was assessed by dna sequencing and ifa after 15 passages in vitro recombinant virus was injected into pigs and efficacy of immune protection was evaluated in comparison with the parental virus results the recombinant virus ch-1r/pil-4 was successfully rescued and shown to have similar growth kinetics as the parental virus the recombinant virus was stable for 15 passages in cell culture pigs vaccinated with ch-1r/pil-4 produced a similar humoral response to the response elicited by parental virus but il-4 level in the supernatant of pbmcs from pigs vaccinated with ch-1r/pil-4 was significantly higher than the parent virus at 28 days post-immunization dpi flow cytometric fcm analysis showed that the percentage of cd4 + cd8 + double positive t dpt cells in the ch-1r/pil-4 vaccinated group was significantly higher than the parental virus at 3 and 7 days post-challenge dpc and the il-4 level in the blood significantly increased at 7 dpc however the viral load and histopathology did not show significant difference between the two groups conclusions a recombinant prrsv expressing porcine il-4 was rescued and it remained genetically stable in vitro the recombinant virus induced higher dpt ratios and il-4 levels in the blood after hp-prrsv challenge compared to the parental virus in piglets however it did not significantly improve protection efficacy of prrsv vaccine
infections with immunosuppressive pigeon circovirus picv pose the most severe health problem to the global pigeon breeding the vaccination with immunogenic picv recombinant capsid protein picv rcp is a potential tool for disease control because of the high prevalence of picv asymptomatic infections the subclinically infected pigeons will be vaccinated in practice the aim of this study was to answer a question if vaccination of asymptomatic infected with picv pigeons induces a similar immune response to picv rcp as in uninfected birds one hundred and twenty 6-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into 4 groups 2 groups of naturally infected and uninfected with picv individuals birds from groups v and v1 were vaccinated twice with picv rcp mixed with an adjuvant whereas pigeons from groups c and c1 were immunized with an adjuvant only the expression of genes encoding ifn-γ cd4 and cd8 t lymphocyte receptors the number of anti-picv rcp igy-secreting b cells sbc and anti-picv rcp igy were evaluated 2 21 39 and 46 days post vaccination dpv study results showed that the expression of cd8 and ifn-γ genes was higher in both groups of infected pigeons than in the uninfected birds irrespective of vaccination in the uninfected birds the expression of these genes was insignificantly higher in the vaccinated pigeons the anti-picv rcp igy-sbc were detected on 2 and 23 dpv and seroconversion was noted on 23 and 39 dpv in v and v1 groups respectively in the light of the results obtained it could be concluded that pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein elicits the immune response in both naturally infected and uninfected pigeons but its rate varies depending on picv infectious status the infection with picv masks the potential cellular immune response to the vaccination with picv rcp and leads to the suppression of humoral immunity
the aims of the current study were to estimate the prevalence of enteropathogens in calves in norwegian dairy herds evaluate the clinical consequences of protozoal infections and identify risk factors for diarrhea the 135 participating herds were randomly selected from those in the norwegian dairy herd recording system that had at least 15 cow-years each herd was followed for 1 yr fecal samples from calves with n = 68 or without n = 691 diarrhea were analyzed for the presence of cryptosporidium giardia and eimeria species diarrheic samples n = 191 were assayed for rotavirus group a bovine coronavirus bcov cryptosporidium and escherichia coli f5 by antigen elisa blood samples n = 1348 were analyzed for antibodies against bcov and rotavirus potential risk factors for diarrhea were analyzed by using cox regression analysis adjusted for herd frailty effect rotavirus and cryptosporidium were the most commonly detected enteropathogens in diarrheic samples a high level of cryptosporidium shedding or bcov seropositive calves in a herd was associated with an increased risk of diarrhea other factors found to increase the risk of diarrhea were use of slatted concrete floor in group pens versus other floor types housing of calves in free-stalls compared with tie-stalls hr = 3.7 purchasing of calves into the herd versus not purchasing calves hr = 4.1 and calves being born during winter compared with other seasons of the year hr = 1.5
evolutionary processes have shaped the vertebrate immune system over time but proximal mechanisms control the onset duration and intensity of immune responses based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system however few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens and their conspecifics living in captivity wild spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented importantly the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations including total igg and igm natural antibodies and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas the striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis
a b s t r a c t neonatal calf diarrhea remains one of the most important problems faced by livestock causing great economic losses this study investigated the prevalence of salmonella and escherichia coli especially enterotoxigenic e coli etec in diarrheic calves fecal samples were collected from 127 diarrheic calves up to 3 months of age at 12 farms from different governorates in egypt 119 bacterial isolates 93.7% were recovered and the prevalences of salmonella and e coli in diarrheic calves were 18.1% and 75.6% respectively serotyping of salmonella isolates revealed that s enteritidis and s typhimurium were the most prevalent serotypes representing 60.9% and 30.4% respectively while s dublin was 8.7%. serogrouping of e coli isolates showed that 10 o-serogroups were obtained where o26 and o103 were the most prevalent 17.7% of each salmonella serotypes showed positive results with pcr test using oligonucleotide primer amplifying 521 bp fragment of inva gene of salmonella while 70% of e coli serogroups possessed etec virulent gene k99 the in-vitro antibiotic sensitivity test indicated that salmonella serotypes showed high sensitivity against enrofloxacin spectinomycin and neomycin while e coli isolates showed high sensitivities against marbofloxacin spectinomycin and neomycin only © 2016 beni-suef university production and hosting by elsevier b v this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license http//creativecommons org/licenses/bync-nd/4.0/.
enterovirus 71 ev71 is a group of viruses that belongs to the picornaviridae family which also includes viruses such as polioviruses ev71 together with coxsackieviruses is widely known for its association with hand foot mouth disease hfmd which generally affects children age five and below besides hfmd ev71 can also trigger more severe and life-threatening neurological conditions such as encephalitis considering the lack of a vaccine and antiviral drug against ev71 together with the increasing spread of these viruses the development of such drugs and vaccines becomes the top priority in protecting our younger generations this article hence reviews some of the recent progress in the formulations of anti-therapeutics and vaccine generation for ev71 covering i inactivated vaccines ii baculovirus-expressed vaccines against ev71 iii human intravenous immunoglobulin ivig treatment and iv the use of monoclonal antibody therapy as a prevention and treatment for ev71 infections
comparisons were made between human enteric coronaviruses and the enteric coronaviruses of pigs and calves by negative staining examination of human intestinal organ culture fluids at various time intervals after inoculation with the human enteric coronavirus showed increasing numbers of particles in the fluids thin sections of the columnar epithelial cells of these explants showed a number of features consistent with the replication of known human and animal coronaviruses virus particles found in thin sections had a mean diameter of 68 nm in addition a structure was found in thin sections which has not been described previously this structure may represent the viral nueleocapsid
characterization of canine coronavirus ccov strains currently in circulation is essential for understanding viral evolution the aim of this study was to determine the presence of pantropic ccov type iia in tissue samples from five puppies that died in southern brazil as a result of severe gastroenteritis reversetranscriptase pcr was used to generate amplicons for sequence analysis phylogenetic analysis of the ccov-iia strains indicated that they were similar to those found in other countries suggesting a common ancestor of these brazilian isolates this is the first report of pantropic ccov-ii in puppies from latin america and our findings highlight that ccov should be included as a differential diagnosis when dogs present with clinical signs and lesions typically seen with canine parvovirus infection
canine parvovirus cpv modified live virus vaccines are able to infect vaccinated dogs replicating in the bloodstream and enteric mucosa however the exact duration and extent of cpv vaccine-induced viremia and fecal shedding are not known with the aim to fill this gap 26 dogs were administered two commercial vaccines containing a cpv-2 or cpv-2b strain and monitored for 28 days after vaccination by using real-time pcr vaccine-induced viremia and shedding were found to be long lasting for both vaccinal strains vaccinal cpv-2b shedding was detected for a shorter period than cpv-2 12 against 19 mean days but with greater viral loads whereas viremia occurred for a longer period 22 against 19 mean days and with higher titers for cpv-2b seroconversion appeared as early as 7 and 14 days post-vaccination for cpv-2b and cpv-2 vaccines respectively with no vaccine there was any diagnostic interference using inclinic or hemagglutination test since positive results were obtained only by fecal real-time pcr testing the present study adds new insights into the cpv vaccine persistence in the organism and possible interference with diagnostic tests
fecal samples n = 107 were collected from cattle with ascertained or suspected diarrheal disease on korean farms during 2008-2010 of these 37 samples tested positive for bovine kobuvirus the 37 positive samples came from 32 cattle that exhibited diarrhea and five cattle that were non-diarrhetic the majority of the viruspositive feces samples were from calves under 1 month of age n = 25 nine of the 37 cattle infected with bovine kobuvirus were confirmed to have a co-infection with other viruses including bovine rotavirus n = 3 bovine coronavirus n = 1 bovine viral diarrhea virus n = 1 and both bovine coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus n = 4 a neighbor-joining tree grouped 36 of the korean kobuvirus strains with the exception of the kb8 strain into three clusters g1 g3 and g4 while strains derived from thailand and japan except the u1 strain were included in the g2 cluster the results indicated that korean bovine kobuvirus has diverse lineages regardless of disease status and species
a cladistic analysis of 23 extant species of the deep-sea pedunculate cirripede family scalpellidae was undertaken based on 61 shell plate characters and taking the jurassic-cretaceous scalpellomorph genus cretiscalpellum as an out-group the consensus tree shows progressive morphological change from basal to more derived taxa but a derived group is marked by major morphological innovation including 27 character state changes that permit subdivision of the family into two sharply demarcated clades -the more basal group is here placed within a redefined scalpellinae arcoscalpellum arcuatoscalpellum gen nov diotascalpellum gen nov graviscalpellum regioscalpellum gen nov and scalpellum and a more derived group named amigdoscalpellinae subfam nov that shows numerous progressive trends in morphology permitting the recognition of three genera amigdoscalpellum catherinum and weltnerium the phylogeny is independently supported by a recently published multiple dna marker-based molecular phylogeny the more basal scalpellinae appeared in the aptian early cretaceous 120 mya and derived amigdoscalpellinae were already present by the campanian late cretaceous 78 mya represented by catherinum anglicum sp nov and amigdoscalpellum bellulum from the uk chalk specialized receptacles to accommodate dwarf males in the apical interior of the scutum evolved at least three times during the history of the scalpellids
emerging infectious diseases eids are considered a major threat to global health most eids appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing eids bats are known to host viruses closely related to important eids here we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro-and coronaviruses in eight bat species in contrast to our hypothesis anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona-and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples however we found that bats infected with either astro-or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus additionally we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding first the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season second there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces the identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals including humans
taiwan suffered from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for sars patients admitted to our hospital cross-reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human t-cell lymphotropic virus htlv in one patient with sars therefore antibodies against htlv were examined in paired-sera from 26 sars patients elisa and a neutralization test were used to measure anti-sars antibodies seroconversion for antibody against sars-cov was observed in all patients surprisingly with the use of elisa for htlv sera for 13 patients were positive for htlv 50% and seroconversion for htlv was also observed in 10 patients 38.5%. western blot for htlv on those 26 paired-sera from 13 htlvpositive patients displayed 5 positive results for htlv-i 7 positive results for htlv-ii 1 positive result for both htlv-i and ii 9 negative results for either htlv-i or htlv-ii and 4 ''indeterminate'' results the findings that antibody to htlv can be detected in blood samples collected from sars patients provide important information for safe handling of blood products without such knowledge blood products can be discarded mistakenly even though they contain anti-sars-cov antibodies that may be potentially valuable for sars therapy
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly emerging infectious disease the potential recurrence of the disease from animal reservoirs highlights the significance of development of safe and efficient vaccines to prevent a future sars epidemic in this study we expressed the recombinant receptor-binding domain rrbd in mammalian 293t cells insect sf9 cells and e coli respectively and compared their immunogenicity and protection against sars-cov infection in an established mouse model our results show that all rrbd proteins expressed in the above systems maintained intact conformation being able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and complete protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in mice albeit the rrbd expressed in 293t cells elicited stronger humoral immune responses with significantly higher neutralizing activity p b 0.05 than those expressed in sf9 and e coli cells these results suggest that all three rrbds are effective in eliciting immune responses and protection against sars-cov and any of the above expression systems can be used for production of rrbd-based sars subunit vaccines preference will be given to rrbd expressed in mammalian cells for future evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in a non-human primate model of sars because of its ability to refold into a native conformation more readily and to induce higher level of neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in e coli and insect cells
avian avulaviruses serotype 1 abbreviated as apmv-1 for the historical name avian paramyxovirus 1 are capable of infecting a wide spectrum of avian species with variable clinical symptoms and outcomes ease of transmission has allowed the virus to spread worldwide with varying degrees of virulence depending upon the virus strain and host species the emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics and the year-to-year genomic changes in low and high virulence apmv-1 imply that distinct genotypes of apmv-1 are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations across the globe this vast genomic diversity may be favoured by large variety of avian species susceptibility to apmv-1 infection and by the availability of highly mobile wild birds it has long been considered that waterfowls are not sensitive to apmv-1 and are unable to show any clinical signs however outbreaks from the 90′s contradict these concepts the apmv-1 isolates are increasingly reported from the waterfowl waterfowl have strong innate immune responses which minimize the impact of virus infection however are unable to prevent the viral shedding numerous apmv-1 are carried by domestic waterfowl intermingling with terrestrial poultry therefore commercial ducks and geese should be vaccinated against apmv-1 to minimize the virus shedding and for the prevention the transmission genetic diversity within apmv-1 demonstrates the need for continual monitoring of viral evolution and periodic updates of vaccine seed-strains to achieve efficient control and eradication of apmv-1 in waterfowls
rift valley fever virus rvfv genus phlebovirus family bunyaviridae is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which can cause hemorrhagic fever neurological disorders or blindness in humans and a high rate of abortion in ruminants mp-12 strain a live-attenuated candidate vaccine is attenuated in the m-and l-segments but the s-segment retains the virulent phenotype mp-12 was manufactured as an investigational new drug vaccine by using mrc-5 cells and encodes a functional nss gene the major virulence factor of rvfv which 1 induces a shutoff of the host transcription 2 inhibits interferon ifnb promoter activation and 3 promotes the degradation of dsrna-dependent protein kinase pkr mp-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals diva although mp-12 lacking nss works for diva it does not replicate efficiently in type-i ifn-competent mrc-5 cells while the use of type-i ifn-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability to generate modified mp-12 vaccine candidates encoding a diva marker while still replicating efficiently in mrc-5 cells we generated recombinant mp-12 encoding punta toro virus adames strain nss rmp12-ptnss or sandfly fever sicilian virus nss rmp12-sfsnss in place of mp-12 nss we have demonstrated that those recombinant mp-12 viruses inhibit ifn-b mrna synthesis yet do not promote the degradation of pkr the rmp12-ptnss but not rmp12-sfsnss replicated more efficiently than recombinant mp-12 lacking nss in mrc-5 cells mice vaccinated with rmp12-ptnss or rmp12-sfsnss induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with mp-12 and were efficiently protected from wild-type rvfv challenge the rmp12-ptnss and rmp12-sfsnss did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-rvfv nss antibody and are therefore applicable to diva thus rmp12-ptnss is highly efficacious replicates efficiently in mrc-5 cells and encodes a diva marker all of which are important for vaccine development for rift valley fever
during pregnancy the maternal immune response changes dramatically over the course of gestation this has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections for example porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets due to the high virulence of pedv and the naïve immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets passive lactogenic immunity to pedv induced during pregnancy via the gut-mammary gland mg-secretory iga siga axis is critical for piglet protection however the anti-pedv immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-mg-siga axis is undefined we hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal pedv infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the mg resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets to understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to pedv three groups of gilts were orally infected with pedv in the first second or third trimester control mock gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester to determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection all piglets were pedv-challenged at 3-5 days postpartum pedv infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum including cytokines b cells pedv antibodies abs and pedv antibody secreting cells ascs pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating pedv iga and igg abs and ascs and pedv virus neutralizing vn abs post pedv infection coinciding with the significantly higher pedv ab responses in second trimester gilts the survival rate of their pedv-challenged piglets was 100% compared with 87.2 55.9 and 5.7% for first third and mock litters respectively additionally piglet survival positively correlated with pedv langel et al gestational stage impacts pedv immunity iga abs and ascs and vn abs in milk and pedv iga and igg abs in piglet serum our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated pedv maternal vaccines whereby pedv intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-mg-siga axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets
background bats belong to one of the most species-rich orders within the mammalia they show a worldwide distribution a high degree of ecological diversification as well as a high diversity of associated parasites and pathogens despite their prominent and unique role the knowledge of their parasite-host-relationships as well as the mechanisms of co-evolutionary processes are partly due to strict conservation regulations scarce methods juvenile specimens of the greater mouse-eared bat myotis myotis from a roosting colony in gladenbach hesse germany were examined for their metazoan endo-and ectoparasite infections and pathogens morphometric data were recorded and the individuals were checked for lyssavirus-specific antigen using a direct immunofluorescence test for unambiguous species identification the bats were analysed by cyt-b sequence comparison results myotis myotis were parasitized by the six insect and arachnid ectoparasite species i e ixodes ricinus ischnopsyllus octactenus ichoronyssus scutatus steatonyssus periblepharus spinturnix myoti and cimex dissimilis additionally the nematode molinostrongylus alatus and the cestode vampirolepis balsaci were recorded each bat was parasitized by at least four species the parasites showed partially extreme rates of infection never recorded before with more than 1440 parasites per single host ichoronyssus scutatus steatonyssus periblepharus vampirolepis balsaci and molinostrongylus alatus are recorded for the first time in germany a checklist for europe is presented containing records of 98 parasite species of 14 myotis species conclusions the myotis myotis from gladenbach hesse germany were parasitized by a diverse parasite fauna with high infestation rates we assume that in juvenile myotis the number of parasites is generally higher than in adults due to only later acquired immune competence and behavioural adaptations our results revealed new insights into parasite fauna of m myotis and european bats in general the finding of endoparasitic cyclophyllidean cestodes that have a two-host lifecycle is considering the stationary behaviour of the juvenile bats rather unusual and suggests a non-predatory transmission mechanism e g via autoinfection a new insight gained from the collated literature was that the european wide composition of the myotis parasite fauna is dominated by a few specific taxonomic groups in europe
novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence however emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health here we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective rna virus species we then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits including human-tohuman transmissibility transmission routes tissue tropisms and host range using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models the random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. in addition to viral taxonomy the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism direct contact or respiratory transmission and limited 0 < r 0 � 1 human-to-human transmissibility we present a novel to our knowledge comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human rna virus species the risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms these risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections
porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals it is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases therefore we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter in parallel samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed this study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs the differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs in addition the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses the results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness this knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development
background porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has led to serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide in this study an oral recombinant lactobacillus casei vaccine against pedv infection targeting the intestinal microfold m cells and dendritic cells dcs for delivering the core neutralizing epitope coe of pedv spike protein was developed with m cell-targeting peptide col and dendritic cell-targeting peptide dcpep the immunogenicity of the orally administered recombinant strains was evaluated results after immunization significantly higher levels of anti-pedv specific igg antibodies with pedv neutralizing activity in the sera and mucosal siga antibodies in the tractus genitalis intestinal mucus and stools were detected in mice orally administered with the recombinant strain ppg-coe-col-dcpep/l393 which expressed dcpep and col targeting ligands fused with the pedv coe antigen compared to mice orally immunized with the recombinant strain ppg-coe/l393 without the dcpep and col targeting ligands moreover in response to restimulation with the pedv coe antigen in vitro a significant difference in splenocyte proliferation response and th2-associated cytokine il-4 level was observed in the group of mice orally immunized with ppg-coe-col-dcpep/l393 p < 0.05 compared to the groups of mice that received ppg-coe-col/l393 and ppg-coe-dcpep/l393 respectively the intestinal m cells-and dcs-targeting oral delivery of genetically engineered lactobacillus expressing the coe antigen of pedv can efficiently induce anti-pedv mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses via oral administration suggesting a promising vaccine strategy against pedv infection
virus-like particles vlps mimic the whole construct of virus particles devoid of viral genome as used in subunit vaccine design vlps can elicit efficient protective immunity as direct immunogens compared to soluble antigens co-administered with adjuvants in several booster injections up to now several prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems such as insect yeast plant and e coli were used to express recombinant proteins especially for vlp production recent studies are also generating vlps in plants using different transient expression vectors for edible vaccines vlps and viral particles have been applied for different functions such as gene therapy vaccination nanotechnology and diagnostics herein we describe vlp production in different systems as well as its applications in biology and medicine v c 2015 wiley periodicals inc biopolymers 105 113-132 2016
in vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against rift valley fever virus rvfv infection we have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia ankara mva encoding rvfv glycoproteins rmvagngc was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal rvfv challenge protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific cd8+ cells with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies in this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after mva vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy thus we tested the efficacy and immune responses in balb/c mice of recombinant mva viruses expressing either glycoprotein gn rmvagn or gc rmvagc in the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the rvfv challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against gc epitopes the involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent furthermore our data suggest that the rmva based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rmvagngc or rmvagn immune serum thus gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in balb/c mice contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response
previously recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus rvsv pseudotypes expressing ebolavirus glycoproteins gps in place of the vsv g protein demonstrated protection of nonhuman primates from lethal homologous ebolavirus challenge those pseudotype vectors contained no additional attenuating mutations in the rvsv genome here we describe rvsv vectors containing a full complement of vsv genes and expressing the ebola virus ebov gp from an additional transcription unit these rvsv vectors contain the same combination of attenuating mutations used previously in the clinical development pathway of an rvsv/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine one of these rvsv vectors n4ct1-ebovgp1 which expresses membrane-anchored ebov gp from the first position in the genome gp1 elicited a balanced cellular and humoral gp-specific immune response in mice guinea pigs immunized with a single dose of this vector were protected from any signs of disease following lethal ebov challenge while control animals died in 7-9 days subsequently n4ct1-ebovgp1 demonstrated complete single-dose protection of 2 macaques following lethal ebov challenge a single sham-vaccinated macaque died from disease due to ebov infection these results demonstrate that highly attenuated rvsv vectors expressing ebov gp may provide safer alternatives to current ebov vaccines
two training centres for working dogs were monitored for one year to determine the presence of viruses and viral antibodies and their association with canine infectious respiratory disease cird tonsillar swabs and serum were obtained from dogs on entry into the kennels and in regular intervals thereafter additional samples were collected during outbreaks of cird the swabs were examined by virus culture and pcr for canine parainfluenza virus canine adenovirus canine herpesvirus chv and canine respiratory coronavirus crcov furthermore the prevalence of antibodies to chv and crcov was determined during this study cird was reported mainly in one of the two kennels investigated in that kennel antibody responses to crcov indicated a seasonal occurrence of the virus which coincided with two outbreaks of respiratory disease chv antibody responses were detected throughout the year in the other kennel which reported few cases of cird a high prevalence of antibodies to crcov was detected on entry but only sporadic seroconversions to crcov or chv by pcr three dogs were found positive for crcov in one kennel whereas all pcr tests for other viruses were negative for both kennels virus culture failed to detect any viruses in either kennel 1494 k erles and j brownlie
a 69-year-old male farmer was referred to the department of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology at ankara training and research hospital after being diagnosed with cchf from a secondary hospital at kastamonu he was suffering from fever fatigue nausea and vomiting for 3 days he was living in kastamonu an endemic area where he owned some cows and had received a tick bite on his back he was hospitalised isolated and administered supportive therapy under barrier nursing his condition deteriorated as he developed respiratory and renal crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease mostly transmitted by tick bites or through contact with infected animal's blood and bodily fluids nosocomial infections were occasionally reported in healthcare settings we report nosocomial cluster of crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever including the visitor with unknown transmission
malaria is a disease induced by parasites of the plasmodium genus which are transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes and represents a great socio-economic burden worldwide plasmodium vivax is the second species of malaria worldwide but it is the most prevalent in latin america and other regions of the planet it is currently considered that vaccines represent a costeffective strategy for controlling transmissible diseases and could complement other malaria control measures however the chemical and immunological complexity of the parasite has hindered development of effective vaccines recent availability of several genomes of plasmodium species as well as bioinformatics tools are allowing the selection of large numbers of proteins and analysis of their immune potential herein we review recently developed strategies for discovery of novel antigens with potential for malaria vaccine development

current evidence suggests that environmental changes and interactions between wildlife livestock and humans contribute to the spillover of infectious agents from bats to other hosts . an increasing number of studies investigating the diversity and infection dynamics of bat pathogens has recently been published however how these infectious agents are transmitted both within bat populations and to other hosts including humans often remains unknown here we summarize current knowledge on direct and indirect transmission routes of bat infectious agents of public health concern fig 1 . although bats are recognized as major reservoir hosts of emerging infectious diseases we highlight that a significant knowledge gap on transmission mechanisms remains and needs further exploration
bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov nipah virus and hendra virus in this study consensus primer-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions rt-pcrs and high-throughput sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected at 11 natural bat habitat sites from july to december 2015 in korea diverse coronaviruses were first detected in korean bat faeces including alphacoronaviruses sars-cov-like and mers-cov-like betacoronaviruses in addition we identified a novel bat rotavirus belonging to group h rotavirus which has only been described in human and pigs until now therefore our results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional virological studies in domestic bat
reynolds d j garwes d j and lucey s 1980 differentiation of canine coronavirus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus by neutralization with canine porcine and feline sera vet microbiol 5 283--290 monospecific antisera were prepared in rabbits against canine coronavirus ccv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs tgev and in 24 pigs and 3 cats against tgev alone neutrmizing antibody titres were higher for the immunizing than the heterologous virus although cross-neutralization usually was detected this confirmed that ccv and tgev are distinct but antigenically related coronaviruses in sera from 41 dogs ccvneutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than tgev-neutralizing titres suggesting that ccv was the causal agent sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis fip and known to contain tgev-neutralizing antibody were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against ccv the fip virus fipv is probably more closely related to ccv than tgev as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229e strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize ccv and tgev thus ccv tgev and probably fipv fall into a g~oup of antigenically related agents separable from other members of the family coronaviridae by both virus neutralization and immunofluorescence tests
animals that hunt and scavenge are often exposed to a broad array of pathogens theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores in light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization domestic cats felis catus are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes we used elisa and western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena ig epitopes molecular weights of heavy iga igg igm and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis and as expected they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins in order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin dnp-klh and serum anti-dnp responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for one year the full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species
while the safety and efficacy profiles of orally administered bovine interferon ifn alpha have been documented the mechanisms that result in clinical benefits remain elusive one approach to delineating the molecular pathways of ifn efficacy is through the use of gene expression profiling technologies in this proof-of-concept study different 0 50 200 and 800 units oral doses of natural bovine ifn type i were tested in cattle to determine if oral ifn altered the expression of genes that may be pivotal to the development of systemic resistance to viral infections such as foot-and-mouth disease fmd oral ifn was administered twice time 0 and 8 h later blood was collected at 0 8 and 24 h after the first ifn administration and dna isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs was employed in quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr microarray assays within 8 h 50 and 200 units of oral ifn induced significant p < 0.05 changes in expression of 41 of 92 tested autoimmune and inflammatory response-associated genes these data suggest that orally administered ifn is a viable approach for providing short-term antiviral immunity to livestock exposed to viruses such as fmd virus fmdv until such a time that an effective vaccine can be produced and distributed to producers
there are six major causes of diarrhea in calves less than 21 days of age enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec rotavirus coronavirus cryptosporidium parvum c parvum type ii salmonella enterica s enterica subsp enterica serovars and nutritional regardless of the etiology calves with diarrhea often have increased coliform bacterial numbers in the small intestine small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is associated with altered small intestinal function morphologic damage and increased susceptibility to bacteremia and endotoxemia 1-3 the importance of bacterial overgrowth in calf diarrhea has garnered renewed attention with the realization that d-lactic acid plays an important role in the development of acidemia in calves with diarrhea production of d-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and is a common finding in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea 4-8 d-lactic acid is a major component of acidemia in diarrheic calves 6 8 9 and is accompanied by systemic signs of weakness and ataxia 10 this review focuses on adjunct therapy of diarrhea in the first 3 weeks of life and therefore does not address the efficacy of adjunct treatment for calf diarrhea due to eimeria bovis eimeria zurneii or giardia duodenalis the main principles of ancillary treatment in neonatal calves with diarrhea and systemic illness are 1 treat or prevent gram-negative septicemia and bacteremia 2 decrease the numbers of coliform bacteria in the proximal small intestine and abomasum 3 increase nonspecific resistance 4 provide nutrients that facilitate repair of damaged intestine and prevent negative energy balance and 5 provide analgesia and reduce stress to the calf
the lung is constantly exposed to both environmental and microbial challenge as a "contained" organ it also constitutes an excellent "self-contained" tissue to examine inflammatory responses and cellular infiltration into a diseased organ influenza a virus iav causes both mild and severe inflammation that is strain specific following infection of the lung epithelium that spreads to other cells of the lung environment here we describe a method of intranasal inoculation of the lung with iav that can be used as a preclinical model of infection mice can be monitored for clinical signs of infection and tissue and lung fluid collected for further analysis to dissect the immunological consequences of iav infection importantly this method can be modified to introduce other pathogens therapies and environmental stimuli to examine immune responses in the lung
rotavirus diarrhea is the major cause of death of millions of children in developing countries besides causing economically significant malady in neonates of many domestic animals in neonates the infection is non-viremic have very short incubation period and manifests profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration concurrent infection with secondary pathogens may augment the disease severity diarrhea occurs due to virusmediated destruction of absorption efficient enterocytes activation of enteric nervous system or due to a rotavirus enterotoxin diagnosis of the infection relies on conventional techniques like isolation in ma 104 cell lines electron microscopy electro-pherotyping and various serological tests presently diagnosis and molecular typing is performed using serotype specific rt-pcr sequencing or genomic hybridization techniques as the rotaviruses are known to exhibit extreme genetic diversity and outplay disinfection procedures eradication of the pathogen is often difficult hence for prevention good management practices coupled with vaccination of dam for protecting young ones has to be practiced recently new generation prophylactic strategies including dna vaccines subunit vaccines virus-like particles vlps and edible vaccines have been found to induce sufficient levels of passive immunity aside to the infection in animals zoonotic significance of the animal rotaviruses has to be further unearthed in this review efforts have been made to highlight the importance and prevalence of the disease in bovines its pathogenesis along with preventive measures salient features of rotaviruses and their inter-vet res commun species transmission abilities zoonotic implications and a concise account of the infection in various domestic animals and poultry
priming and activation of cd8 + t cell responses is crucial to achieve anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity live attenuated measles vaccine strains have been used successfully for immunization for decades and are currently investigated in trials of oncolytic virotherapy the available reverse genetics systems allow for insertion of additional genes including heterologous antigens here we designed recombinant measles vaccine vectors for priming and activation of antigen-specific cd8 + t cells for proof-of-concept we used cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl lines specific for the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 trp-2 or the model antigen chicken ovalbumin ova respectively we generated recombinant measles vaccine vectors with trp-2 and ova epitope cassette variants for expression of the full-length antigen or the respective immunodominant cd8 + epitope with additional variants mediating secretion or proteasomal degradation of the epitope we show that these recombinant measles virus vectors mediate varying levels of mhc class i mhc-i-restricted epitope presentation leading to activation of cognate ctls as indicated by secretion of interferon-gamma ifnγ in vitro importantly the recombinant ova vaccines also mediate priming of naïve ot-i cd8 + t cells by dendritic cells while all vaccine variants can prime and activate cognate t cells ifnγ release was enhanced using a secreted epitope variant and a variant with epitope strings targeted to the proteasome the principles presented in this study will facilitate the design of recombinant vaccines to elicit cd8 + responses against pathogens and tumor antigens
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is one of the most economically important pathogens that hinder the development of global pork industry its nonstructural protein 11 nsp11 with the nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease nendou domain is essential for prrsv genome replication and it also contributes to host innate immunity suppression however the immunogenicity and immune structure of prrsv nsp11 have not been well investigated yet in this study a monoclonal antibody mab designated 3f9 that against nsp11 was generated subsequently a series of partially overlapped fragments covered the nsp11 40-223aa were expressed to test the reactivity with mab 3f9 and the 111 dcrey 115 was found to be the core unit of the b-cell epitope recognized by mab 3f9 further investigation indicated that both genotype 1 and genotype 2 prrsv can be recognized by mab 3f9 due to the 111 dcrey 115 is conserved in both genotype virus meanwhile this epitope localized at the surface of nsp11 in 3d structure is confirmed to be able to induce humoral immune response in prrsv infected pigs these findings do not only provide an mab tool to further investigate the function of nsp11 they also indicate the diagnostic potential for this epitope et al 2017 identification of a novel linear b-cell epitope in nonstructural protein 11 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus that are conserved in both genotypes plos one 12 11 e0188946 https//doi org/10.30 years ago prrs is initially named as "mystery disease" due to unknowing its pathogen at the early outbreak . considering many mechanisms of its pathogenesis replication and immune regulation are unclear even now the prrsv is still a mystery virus the nonstructural fig 4 serological test for prrsv nsp11 and the identified 111 dcrey 115 epitope a the nsp11 specific antibody in anti-prrsv sera were detected by reacting with nsp11 40-223aa protein in wb test b the nsp11 specific antibody in anti-prrsv sera were detected by nsp11 40-223aa coated indirect elisa cthe 111 dcrey 115 epitope specific antibody in anti-prrsv sera were detected by peptide coated indirect elisa asterisk indicates significant differences between prrsv positive sera and negative sera or between control and mab 3f9 * p<0.05 ** p<0.01 *** p<0.001 fig 6 localization and spatial distribution of the identified 111 dcrey 115 epitope a the identified epitope was labeled in the sequence chain view picture of prrsv nsp11 obtained from the protein data bank pdb with the id 5eyi b spatial distribution of the identified epitope on the nsp11
background knowledge about the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza a viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding of the evolution and migration of strains few complete genome sequences of influenza a viruses from europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza a viruses we have studied the evolution of circulating human h3n2 h1n1 and h1n2 influenza a viruses from 1999 to 2006 we analysed 234 danish human influenza a viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes
three human coronaviruses are known to exist human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov here we report the identification of a fourth human coronavirus hcov-nl63 using a new method of virus discovery the virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis the complete genome sequence indicates that this virus is not a recombinant but rather a new group 1hcov-nl63-infected individuals indicating that the virus was widely spread within the human population
of recent advances antibodies through passive or active immunization play a central role in prophylaxis against many infectious agents while neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses the relative contribution of fc-dependent and complement-dependent antiviral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies the multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses in addition to virus size influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization these new findings will improve our strategies in therapeutic antibody engineering and rational vaccine design
vaccination is the most effective method of disease prevention and control many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics e g smallpox poliomyelitis measles and diphtheria are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs nonetheless vaccine manufacturing remains incredibly challenging viruses exhibiting high antigenic diversity and high mutation rates cannot be fairly contested using traditional vaccine production methods and complexities surrounding the manufacturing processes which impose significant limitations virus-like particles vlps are recombinantly produced viral structures that exhibit immunoprotective traits of native viruses but are noninfectious severalvlps that compositionally match a given natural virus have been developed and licensed as vaccines expansively a plethora of studies now confirms that vlps can be designed to safely present heterologous antigens from a variety of pathogens unrelated to the chosen carrier vlps owing to this design versatility vlps offer technological opportunities to modernize vaccine supply and disease response through rational bioengineering these opportunities are greatly enhanced with the application of synthetic biology the redesign and construction of novel biological entities this review outlines how synthetic biology is currently applied to engineer vlp functions and manufacturing process current and developing technologies for the identification of novel target-specific antigens and their usefulness for rational engineering of vlp functions e g presentation of structurally diverse antigens enhanced antigen immunogenicity and improved vaccine stability are described when applied to manufacturing processes synthetic biology approaches can also overcome specific challenges in vlp vaccine production finally we address several challenges and benefits associated with the translation of vlp vaccine development into the industry k e y w o r d s
bats and rodents are recognized to host a great diversity of viruses and several important viral zoonoses but how this viral diversity is structured and how viruses are connected shared and distributed among host networks is not well understood to address this gap in knowledge we compared the associative capacity of the host-virus networks in rodents and bats with the identification of those viruses with zoonotic potential a virus database detected by molecular methods was constructed in the two taxonomic groups we compiled 5484 records 825 in rodents and 4659 in bats we identified a total of 173 and 166 viruses of which 53 and 40 are zoonotic viruses in rodents and bats respectively based on a network theory a non-directed bipartite host-virus network was built for each group subsequently the networks were collapsed to represent the connections among hosts and viruses we identified both discrete and connected communities we observed a greater degree of connectivity in bat viruses and more discrete communities in rodents the coronaviridae recorded in bats have the highest values of degree betweenness and closeness centralities in rodents higher degree positions were distributed homogeneously between viruses and hosts at least in our database a higher proportion of rodent viruses were zoonotic rodents should thus not be underestimated as important reservoirs of zoonotic disease we found that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than in rodents network theory can reveal some macroecological patterns and identify risks that were previously unrecognized for example we found that parvovirus in megabats and gbagroube virus in rodents may represent a zoonotic risk due to the proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses we propose that epidemiological surveillance programmes should consider the connectivity of network actors as a measure of the risks of dispersion and transmission disease ecology host-parasite network viral diversity zoonoses
cryptosporidium parvum is a common pathogen in preweaned calves but in sweden cryptosporidium bovis which is considered apathogenic is the most common species in this age group and it has been identified in diarrhoeal samples indicating that it could be a cause of diarrhoea in routine diagnostic procedures infection is determined by microscopy which is not sufficient to differentiate these species we investigated whether routine cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures need improvement to include species determination the relation of cryptosporidium spp and subtype with the clinical picture and other pathogens was also investigated a total of 782 diarrhoeal calf samples were analysed and cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in 198 samples cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 178 c bovis in six and mixed c bovis/c parvum in seven samples twenty-seven c parvum subtypes were identified of which 16 were newly described except for three herds only one subtype per herd was identified cryptosporidium parvum-positive calves were younger than c bovis-positive calves and most c parvum infections were seen at 1-3 weeks of age oocyst counts were higher in c parvum samples yellow faecal colour was associated with c parvum infection watery faeces had no greater association with c parvum infection but c parvum subtype family iia was more common than subtype family iid in watery faecal samples no other pathogens were detected in the six c bovis-infected calves indicating a pathogenic potential our results show that species determination does not need to be included in routine cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures in order to estimate the clinical relevance of infection in diarrhoeal calves the maximum age when analysis for clinical cryptosporidiosis is performed can be lowered to 6 weeks of age however the indicated pathogenic potential of c bovis warrants further attention ó
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv continues to be a major problem to the pork industry worldwide increasing data indicate that prrsv strains differ in virulence in infected pigs and are biologically antigenically and genetically heterogeneous it is evident that the current vaccines based on a single prrsv strain are not effective in protecting against infections with the genetically diverse ®eld strains of prrsv the recent outbreaks of atypical or acute prrs in vaccinated pigs have raised a serious concern about the ef®cacy of the current vaccines and provided the impetus for developing more effective vaccines special attention in this review is given to published work on antigenic pathogenic and genetic variations of prrsv and its potential implications for vaccine ef®cacy and development although there are ample data documenting the heterogeneous nature of prrsv strains information regarding how the heterogeneity is generated and what clinical impact it may have is very scarce the observed heterogeneity will likely pose a major obstacle for effective prevention and control of prrs there remains an urgent need for fundamental research on this virus to understand the basic biology and the mechanism of heterogeneity and pathogenesis of prrsv #
faeces samples collected from diarrhoeic dairy calves in the first 8 weeks of life were examined for the presence of 5 enteropathogens the majority of the 108 diarrhoea cases occurred in the first 5 weeks of life and a commercial elisa kit detected bovine enteric coronavirus bec in 38.9% serogroup a rotavirus rv in 16.7% and k99 fs fimbria adhesin-positive escherichia coli /c09 etec in 11.1 per cent concurrent infections of these enteropathogens were detected in 14.8% of samples 30.8% of samples positive for these agents no evidence of cryptosporidial infection was found using a differential staining method on faecal smears nor was salmonella excretion detected on 2 of the 8farms only bec was present the other 6farms were positive for all 3 agents it is concluded that bec is the major infectious cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea in the ethiopian dairy herds studied with rv and k99 etec also contributing to morbidity either alone or as mixed infections
due to their genetic relatedness great apes are highly susceptible to common human respiratory pathogens although most respiratory pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv rarely cause severe disease in healthy human adults they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in wild great apes habituated to humans for research or tourism to prevent pathogen transmission most great ape projects have established a set of hygiene measures ranging from keeping a specific distance to the use of surgical masks and establishment of quarantines this study investigates the incidence of respiratory symptoms and human respiratory viruses in humans at a human-great ape interface the taï chimpanzee project tcp in côte d'ivoire and consequently the effectiveness of a 5-day quarantine designed to reduce the risk of potential exposure to human respiratory pathogens to assess the impact of quarantine as a preventative measure we monitored the quarantine process and tested 262 throat swabs for respiratory viruses collected during quarantine over a period of 1 year although only 1 subject tested positive for a respiratory virus hrsv 17 subjects developed symptoms of infection while in quarantine and were subsequently kept from approaching the chimpanzees preventing potential exposure in 18 cases our results suggest that quarantine-in combination with monitoring for symptoms-is effective in reducing the risk of potential pathogen exposure this research contributes to our understanding of how endangered great apes can be protected from human-borne infectious disease
respiratory viruses of human origin infect wild apes across africa sometimes lethally here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses human metapneumovirus mpv pneumoviridae metapneumovirus and human respirovirus 3 hrv3 paramyxoviridae respirovirus formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3 in two chimpanzee pan troglodytes schweinfurthii communities in the same forest in uganda in december 2016 and january 2017 the viruses were absent before the outbreaks but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus epidemiologic modelling showed that mpv and hrv3 were similarly transmissible r 0 of 1.27 and 1.48 respectively but mpv caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees whereas hrv3 caused no direct mortality these results are consistent with the higher virulence of mpv than hrv3 in humans although both mpv and hrv3 cause a significant global disease burden both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants with mpv closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas gorilla beringei beringei suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts these findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes our results also caution against assuming common causation in coincident outbreaks
cryptosporidium and giardia are two common aetiological agents of infectious enteritis in humans and animals worldwide these parasitic protists are usually transmitted by the faecaleoral route following the ingestion of infective stages oocysts or cysts an essential component of the control of these parasitic infections from a public health perspective is an understanding of the sources and routes of transmission in different geographical regions bovines are considered potential sources of infection for humans because species and genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia infecting humans have also been isolated from cattle in molecular parasitological studies however species and genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia of bovids and the extent of zoonotic transmission in different geographical regions in the world are still relatively poorly understood the purpose of this article is to 1 provide a brief background on cryptosporidium and giardia 2 review some key aspects of the molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in animals with an emphasis on bovines 3 summarize research of cryptosporidium and giardia from cattle and water buffaloes in parts of australasia and sri lanka considering public health aspects and 4 provide a perspective on future avenues of study recent studies reinforce that bovines harbour cryptosporidium and giardia that likely pose a human health risk and highlight the need for future investigations of the biology population genetics and transmission dynamics of cryptosporidium and giardia in cattle water buffaloes and other ruminants in different geographical regions the fate and transport of infective stages following their release into the environment as well as for improved strategies for the control and prevention of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis guided by molecular epidemiological studies were reported meisel et al
newcastle disease nd is one of the highly pathogenic viral diseases of avian species nd is economically significant because of the huge mortality and morbidity associated with it the disease is endemic in many third world countries where agriculture serves as the primary source of national income newcastle disease virus ndv belongs to the family paramyxoviridae and is well characterized member among the avian paramyxovirus serotypes in recent years ndv has lured the virologists not only because of its pathogenic potential but also for its oncolytic activity and its use as a vaccine vector for both humans and animals the ndv based recombinant vaccine offers a pertinent choice for the construction of live attenuated vaccine due to its modular nature of transcription minimum recombination frequency and lack of dna phase during replication our current understanding about the ndv biology is expanding rapidly because of the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput complete genome sequencing
while classical virology techniques such as virus culture electron microscopy or classical pcr had been unsuccessful in identifying the causative agent responsible for the fulminating disease of guinea fowl we identifi ed a novel avian gammacoronavirus associated with the disease using metagenomics nextgeneration sequencing is an unbiased approach that allows the sequencing of virtually all the genetic material present in a given sample

the study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus revealed the close association of the disease with measles--or a related virus high titres of antibodies to measles virus were found in patients that correlated with the course of the disease immunofluorescence tests revealed measles virus or a related antigen in lupus-affected tissues inclusion bodies consisting of paramyxovirus-like ribonucleoprotein structures were regularly detected in both affected tissues and leukocytes molecular hybridization of measles virus rna with dna from the affected tissues showed that dna transcripts of measles or a closely related virus are integrated in the cellular nuclear dna possible pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease are discussed
feline infectious peritonitis fip is an immune-mediated highly lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus fcov infection currently no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent fcov isolates since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing fip and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon-γ ifn-γ production we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms snp in the feline ifn-γ gene fifng are associated with the outcome of infection a total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 fip cats were analyzed and 16 snp were identified in intron 1 of fifng among these snp the ffing + 428 t allele was shown to be a fip-resistant allele p = 0.03 and the heterozygous genotypes 01c/t and +408c/t were found to be fip-susceptible factors p = 0.004 furthermore an fifng + 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of ifn-γ in fip cats for the identification of these three fip-related snp genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system pcr arms-pcr and restriction fragment length polymorphisms rflp and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing the identification of additional fip-related snp will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to fip
nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev are closely related deadly zoonotic paramyxoviruses that have emerged and re-emerged over the last 10 years in this study a subunit vaccine formulation containing only recombinant soluble attachment glycoprotein from hev sg hev and cpg adjuvant was evaluated as a potential niv vaccine in the cat model different amounts of sg hev were employed and sg-induced immunity was examined vaccinated animals demonstrated varying levels of niv-specific ig systemically and importantly all vaccinated cats possessed antigen-specific iga on the mucosa upon oronasal challenge with niv 50000 tcid 50 all vaccinated animals were protected from disease although virus was detected on day 21 post-challenge in one animal the ability to elicit protective systemic and mucosal immunity in this animal model provides significant progress towards the development of a human subunit vaccine against henipaviruses
vaccines have been the single most significant advancement in public health preventing morbidity and mortality in millions of people annually vaccine development has traditionally focused on whole organism vaccines either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines while successful for many different infectious diseases whole organisms are expensive to produce require culture of the infectious agent and have the potential to cause vaccine associated disease in hosts with advancing technology and a desire to develop safe cost effective vaccine candidates the field began to focus on the development of recombinantly expressed antigens known as subunit vaccines while more tolerable subunit vaccines tend to be less immunogenic attempts have been made to increase immunogenicity with the addition adjuvants either immunostimulatory molecules or an antigen delivery system that increases immune responses to vaccines an area of extreme interest has been the application of nanotechnology to vaccine development which allows for antigens to be expressed on a particulate delivery system one of the most exciting examples of nanovaccines are rationally designed protein nanoparticles these nanoparticles use some of the basic tenants of structural biology biophysical chemistry and vaccinology to develop protective safe and easily manufactured vaccines rationally developed nanoparticle vaccines are one of the most promising candidates for the future of vaccine development
an iranian isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus irfibv32 was quantified in experimentally infected broilers using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and histopathological changes was investigated thirty-six 3-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated by 10 5 eld50/0.1 ml of the virus on the various days post inoculation dpi different tissues were collected the virus strongly started the replication in trachea at 1 dpi and reached to the maximum titer at 3 dpi the highest ibv rna level was shown in this organ in lung the virus was replicated with the titer lower than that of the trachea but it rose up more at 5 dpi the kidneys were the tissues with the least viral genome copy number although the duration of the virus presence was considerable the virus replicated in testes sooner than ovaries also disappeared sooner but the maximum viral yield in the ovaries was more the virus titer in the studied tissues had an interesting fluctuation especially in caecal tonsils testes and ovaries were the organs that the virus could reactivate without using any chemical the most severe lesions were observed in tracheae but they appeared in the lungs later lymphocyte infiltration in the kidneys was noted from 5 dpi even sooner than the lungs there were no lesions in the caecal tonsils testes and ovaries in spite of the virus replication in a high titer
background h3n2 influenza viruses circulating in humans and european pigs originate from the pandemic a/hong kong/68 virus because of slower antigenic drift in swine the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing it remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross-protection between recent human and swine h3n2 influenza viruses objectives we examined whether prior infection of pigs with an old or a more recent human h3n2 virus protected against a european swine h3n2 virus . genetic and antigenic relationships between sw/gent/08 and a selection of human h3n2 viruses were also assessed results after challenge with sw/gent/08 all challenge controls had high virus titers in the entire respiratory tract at 3 days postchallenge and nasal virus excretion for 5-6 days prior infection with sw/gent/08 or a/vic/75 offered complete virological protection against challenge pigs previously inoculated with a/wis/05 showed similar virus titers in the respiratory tract as challenge controls but the mean duration of nasal shedding was 1á3 days shorter unlike sw/gent/08-and a/vic/75-inoculated pigs a/wis/05-inoculated pigs lacked cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/gent/08 before challenge but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge cross-protection and serological responses correlated with genetic and antigenic differences conclusions infection immunity to a recent human h3n2 virus confers minimal cross-protection against a european swine h3n2 virus we discuss our findings with regard to the recent zoonotic infections of humans in the united states with a swine-origin h3n2 variant virus please cite this paper as qiu et al 2013 prior infection of pigs with a recent human h3n2 influenza virus confers minimal cross-protection against a european swine h3n2 virus
the humoral intrathecal immune response in coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats associated with an autoimmune reaction to brain antigen was analysed the csf of these animals revealed immune reactions which were directed against coronavirus and other unknown antigens in general no direct correlation between the disease the state of the blood-brain barrier bbb intrathecal synthesis of ig and the presence of virus-specific antibodies was detectable suggesting that the humoral in contrast to the cellular immune response does not play a significant pathogenetic role in this cns disease
the rapid global spread of sars-cov-2 and resultant mortality and social disruption 34 have highlighted the need to better understand coronavirus immunity to expedite 35 vaccine development efforts multiple candidate vaccines designed to elicit 36 protective neutralising antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein are rapidly 37 advancing to clinical trial however the immunogenic properties of the spike protein 38 in humans are unresolved to address this we undertook an in-depth characterisation 39 of humoral and cellular immunity against sars-cov-2 spike in humans following 40 mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection we find serological antibody responses 41 against spike are routinely elicited by infection and correlate with plasma neutralising 42 activity and capacity to block ace2/rbd interaction expanded populations of spike-43 specific memory b cells and circulating t follicular helper cells ctfh were detected 44 within convalescent donors while responses to the receptor binding domain rbd 45 constitute a minor fraction using regression analysis we find high plasma 46 neutralisation activity was associated with increased spike-specific antibody but 47 notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific ctfh subsets thus both 48 qualitative and quantitative features of b and t cell immunity to spike constitute 49 informative biomarkers of the protective potential of novel sars-cov-2 vaccines 50 51 52 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission
experimental data suggest that the addition of spray-dried plasma sdp to pig feed may enhance antibody responses against certain pathogens and negatively impact virus survival the benefit of sdp on escherichia coli infection is well documented the aim of this study was to determine the effect of bovine sdp bovsdp in the pig diet on acute porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection a total of 16 3-wk-old conventional crossbred pigs were used and divided into three groups treatments included 1 a negative control group fed a commercial diet and sham inoculated with commercial liquid porcine plasma n = 3 2 a positive control group fed a commercial diet and inoculated with pedv-spiked porcine plasma pedv n = 8 and 3 a third group of pigs fed the commercial diet with inclusion of 5% spray-dried bovine plasma and inoculated with pedv-spiked porcine plasma bovsdp n = 5 although clinical signs associated with pedv infection were mild in the bovsdp group two of eight pigs in the pedv group developed moderate clinical disease and had to be euthanized the pedv igg and iga antibody levels and prevalence rates were significantly p < 0.05 higher in the pedv-bovsdp group compared with the pedv group at 7 d postinoculation the average fecal pedv rna shedding time was 7.2 ± 1.0 d for the pedv-bovsdp group and 9.3 ± 1.1 d for the pedv group with an overall time to clearance of pedv shedding of 11 d for pedv-bovsdp pigs and at least 14 d for pedv pigs which was not different p = 0.215 the results indicate that addition of bovsdp induced an earlier anti-pedv antibody response in pigs experimentally infected with pedv thereby reducing clinical disease and the amount and duration of viral shedding during acute pedv infection
the pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus mhv-s infection in suckling and weanling mice was comparatively studied after intranasal inoculation in sucklings infectious virus as well as specific antigen was first detected in the nasal mucosa at 12 hr then in the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs at this stage viral particles were demonstrated both in the supporting cells and olfactory cells of the nasal mucosa in the posterior part of the brain and spinal cord virus was detected on days 3 to 4 postinoculation when viral growth was clearly demonstrable in the liver spleen and intestines in weanlings too infection was first established in the nasal mucosa shedding infectious virus in the nasal washing until day 6 postinoculation and later infection spread to the brain and spinal cord in weanling mice however neither infectious virus nor viral antigen was detected in the liver or other visceral organs while serum neutralizing antibody became detectable on day 5 postinoculation increasing in titer thereafter histopathologically degenerative and necrotic changes were observed in the nasal mucosa and central nervous system of both age groups of animals coincidentally with the presence of viral specific antigen while inflammatory response was much less prominent in sucklings in the liver spleen and intestines however some lesions were observed only in sucklings
serum levels of igg igm and iga against severe acute respiratory distress syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov were detected serially with the use of immunofluorescent antibody assays in 30 patients with sars seroconversion for igg mean 10 days occurred simultaneously or 1 day earlier than that for igm and iga mean 11 days for both igg could be detected as early as 4 days after the onset of illness the earliest time at which these three antibodies reached peak levels was similar mean 15 days a high igg level 1800 could persist for > 3 months the kinetics of neutralisation antibodies obtained with 100· the tissue culture infective dose tcid 50 of the sars-cov tw1 strain in five patients with sars nearly paralleled those for igg there were no significant differences in the kinetics of the igg igm and iga responses between patients with or without underlying medical disease steroid or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or mechanical ventilation
coronaviruses are a hot research topic because they can cause severe diseases in humans and animals infectious bronchitis virus ibv belonging to gamma-coronaviruses causes a highly infectious respiratory viral disease and can result in catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide unfortunately the genetic basis of the host immune responses against ibv is poorly understood in the present study the antibody levels against ibv post-immunization were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 511 individuals from a commercial chicken gallus gallus population a genome-wide association study using 43211 single nucleotide polymorphism markers was performed to identify the major loci affecting the immune response against ibv this study detected 20 significant p < 1.16 â 10 à6 effect single nucleotide polymorphisms for the antibody level against ibv these single nucleotide polymorphisms were distributed on five chicken chromosomes gga involving gga1 gga3 gga5 gga8 and gga9 the genes in the 1-mb windows surrounding each single nucleotide polymorphism with significant effect for the antibody level against ibv were associated with many biological processes or pathways related to immunity such as the defense response and mtor signaling pathway a genomic region containing a cluster of 13 beta-defensin gal1-13 and interleukin-17f genes on gga3 probably plays an important role in the immune response against ibv in addition the major loci significantly associated with the antibody level against ibv on gga1 and gga5 could explain about 12% and 13% of the phenotypic variation respectively this study suggested that the chicken genome has several important loci affecting the immune response against ibv and increases our knowledge of how to control outbreaks of infectious bronchitis
thanks to their strong immunostimulating properties and safety for humans plant viruses represent an appropriate basis for the design of novel vaccines the coat protein of alternanthera mosaic virus can form virus-like particles that are stable under physiological conditions and have adjuvant properties this work presents a recombinant human rotavirus a antigen based on the epitope of rotavirus structural protein vp6 using alternanthera mosaic virus coat protein as a carrier an expression vector containing the gene of alternanthera mosaic virus mu strain coat protein fused to the epitope of rotavirus protein vp6 was designed immunoblot analysis showed that the chimeric protein was effectively recognized by commercial polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus and therefore is a suitable candidate for development of a vaccine prototype interaction of the chimeric recombinant protein with the native coat protein of alternanthera mosaic virus and its rna resulted in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes that were recognized by antirotavirus antibodies
avian gastrointestinal gi tracts are highly populated with a diverse array of microorganisms that share a symbiotic relationship with their hosts and contribute to the overall health and disease state of the intestinal tract the microbiome of the young chick is easily prone to alteration in its composition by both exogenous and endogenous factors especially during the early posthatch period the genetic background of the host and exposure to pathogens can impact the diversity of the microbial profile that consequently contributes to the disease progression in the host the objective of this study was to profile the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in young chickens from two genetically distinct highly inbred lines furthermore the effect of the salmonella enteritidis infection on altering the composition makeup of the chicken microbiome was evaluated through the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis one-day-old layer chicks were challenged with s enteritidis and the host cecal microbiota profile as well as the degree of susceptibility to salmonella infection was examined at 2 and 7 days post infection our result indicated that host genotype had a limited effect on resistance to s enteritidis infection alpha diversity beta diversity and overall microbiota composition were analyzed for four factors host genotype age treatment and postinfection time points s enteritidis infection in young chicks was found to significantly reduce the overall diversity of the microbiota population with expansion of enterobacteriaceae family these changes indicated that salmonella colonization in the gi tract of the chickens has a direct effect on altering the natural development of the gi microbiota the impact of s enteritidis infection on microbial communities was also more substantial in the late stage of infection significant inverse correlation between enterobacteriaceae and lachnospiraceae family in both non-infected and infected groups suggested possible antagonistic interaction between members of these two taxa which could potentially influences the overall microbial population in the gut our results also revealed that genetic difference between two lines had minimal effect on the establishment of microbiota population overall this study provided preliminary insights into the contributing role of s enteritidis in influencing the overall makeup of chicken's gut microbiota viable counts of s enteritidis were recovered from one of the ceca pouches by squeezing its contents into 10 ml pbs and placing immediately on ice after the collection the second pouch of ceca was collected on ice and frozen at −20°c for the dna extraction the weight of the cecum content was measured prior
cystoisospora syn isospora suis is the causative agent of neonatal porcine coccidiosis and one of the main causes of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide infection with porcine cytomegalovirus pcmv suid herpesvirus 2 causes inclusion body rhinitis in pigs in a swiss pig herd n = 2 boars 7 sows 2 gilts 18 finishing pigs 30 fattening pigs 54 suckling piglets an outbreak of pcmv infection with high morbidity in all age categories characterized by fever anorexia reduced general condition respiratory signs and increased piglet mortality was diagnosed by histopathology and molecular methods five fattening pigs age~17 weeks additionally showed diarrhoea not typical for pcmv infections and one fattener had to be euthanized due to poor condition histopathologically severe fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis with extensive atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi loss of goblet cells and crypt abscesses associated to c suis infection were present in the liver herpesvirus intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed and pcmv was confirmed by pcr/sequencing no further infectious causes of diarrhoea i e rotavirus a tgev pedv pcv-2 enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or lawsonia intracellularis were detected in the euthanized fattener coproscopically c suis oocysts were identified in the faeces from further fatteners with diarrhoea while c suis usually produces disease only in suckling piglets its association with severe intestinal lesions and diarrhoea in~17-week-old fatteners was surprising it is supposed that the underlying pcmv infection might have contributed to the presentation of clinical cystoisosporosis in fattening pigs the interaction mechanisms between these two pathogens are unknown
10 11 sars-cov-2 a coronavirus that newly emerged in china in late 2019 12 and spread rapidly 12 worldwide caused the first witnessed pandemic sparked by a coronavirus as the pandemic 13 progresses information about the modes of transmission of sars-cov-2 among humans is critical 14 to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread here we show that sars-15 cov-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air via respiratory droplets and/or 16 aerosols between ferrets intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper 17 respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation sars-18 cov-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure 19 and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days 20 after exposure the pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets 21 was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive 22
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is a major disease affecting pigs worldwide and resulting in considerable economic losses while prrs is a global phenomenon the causative viruses prrsv-1 first detected in europe and prrsv-2 isolated in north america are genetically and biologically distinct in addition the disease outcome is directly linked to co-infections associated with the porcine respiratory disease complex and the host response is variable between different breeds of pigs it is therefore warranted when studying the pathogenesis of prrs to consider each viral genotype separately and apply careful consideration to the disease model studied we here review the respiratory pig model for prrsv-1 with a focus on a recent set of studies conducted with carefully selected virus strains and pigs which may serve as both a baseline and benchmark for future investigation crown
hepadnaviruses infect several animal species the prototype species human hepatitis b virus hbv increases the risk of liver diseases and may cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma recently a novel hepadnavirus similar to hbv has been identified through transcriptomics studies in a domestic cat with large cell lymphoma in australia herewith a collection of 390 feline serum samples was screened for hepadnavirus overall the virus was identified in 10.8% of the sera with a significantly higher prevalence 17.8% in the sera of animals with a clinical suspect of infectious disease upon genome sequencing the virus was closely related 97.0% nt identity to the prototype australian feline virus sydney 2016 the mean and median values of hepadnavirus in the feline sera were 1.3 × 10 6 and 2.1 × 10 4 genome copies per ml range 3.3 × 10 0 -2.5 × 10 7 genome copies per ml for a subset of hepadnavirus-positive samples information on the hemato-chemical parameters was available and in 10/20 animals a profile suggestive of liver damage was present also in 7/10 animals with suspected hepatic disease virus load was >10 4 genome copies per ml i e above the threshold considered at risk of active hepatitis and liver damage for hbv viruses of the genus orthohepadnavirus family hepadnaviridae are partially double-stranded dna viruses that infect a variety of mammals chronic infections in humans of the prototype species hepatitis b virus hbv increase the risk of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 1 .hepadnaviruses have been identified in several animal species including primates bats rodents birds and fish 2 . recently a novel member of the family hepadnaviridae similar to hbv has been identified through transcriptomics studies in a domestic cat with large cell lymphoma 3 . preliminary epidemiological data collected by australian researchers suggest that the hepadnavirus of domestic cat dch is common in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus fiv 3 . in order to gather additional information on dch we analyzed sera collected from household cats with different age 0-15 years and clinical histories obtained from veterinary diagnostic laboratories
development of vaccination strategies for emerging pathogens are particularly challenging because of the sudden nature of their emergence and the long process needed for traditional vaccine development therefore there is a need for development of a rapid method of vaccine development that can respond to emerging pathogens in a short time frame the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in late 2012 demonstrate the importance of coronaviruses as emerging pathogens the spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses reside on the surface of the virion and are responsible for virus entry the spike glycoprotein is the major immunodominant antigen of coronaviruses and has proven to be an excellent target for vaccine designs that seek to block coronavirus entry and promote antibody targeting of infected cells vaccination strategies for coronaviruses have involved live attenuated virus recombinant viruses nonreplicative virus-like particles expressing coronavirus proteins or dna plasmids expressing coronavirus genes none of these strategies has progressed to an approved human coronavirus vaccine in the ten years since sars-cov emerged here we describe a novel method for generating mers-cov and sars-cov full-length spike nanoparticles which in combination with adjuvants are able to produce high titer antibodies in mice
the domestic pig is an important agricultural animal and thus infectious diseases that affect pigs can cause severe economic losses in the global swine industry various porcine pathogens target macrophages which are classical innate immune cells although macrophages basically protect the host from pathogens they also seem to contribute to infectious processes therefore cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens however the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited in this study we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage ipkm cell line which was generated by transferring the sv40 large t antigen sv40lt and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase ptert genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors the ipkm displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged doubling time about 4 days these cells were immunostained for macrophage markers in addition they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide lps stimulation furthermore the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in lps-primed ipkm these findings suggest that ipkm exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages by transferring the sv40lt and ptert genes using lentiviral vectors we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig these results suggest that the co-expression of sv40lt and ptert is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages
bats are notorious reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases and may be uniquely tolerant of infection among mammals broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts vector-borne bacteria of the genus bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous bartonella lineages in bats we assembled a sequence database of bartonella strains consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of bartonella to date this analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography we estimate that bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the cretaceous-paleogene boundary additionally the radiation of particular bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus we conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders these results support a 'bat seeding' hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases to clarify the evolution of the bartonella genus which contains important human pathogens we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of bartonella strains including novel strains from bats our results indicate that bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of bartonella lineages these patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts
tuberculosis tb remains a serious health problem worldwide and an urgent need exists to improve or replace the available vaccine mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guérin bcg most vaccination protocols adapt two or three doses to induce long-term lasting immunity our previous study showed that the naked dna encoding the triple-antigen fusion tfp846 rv3615c-mtb10.4-rv2660c induced robust t cellular immune responses accompanying four inoculations against mycobacteria infection however a number of compliance issues exist in some areas lacking the appropriate medical infrastructure with multiple administrations in this study a novel vesicular stomatitis virus expressing tfp846 vsv-846 was developed and the immune responses elicited by vsv-846 were evaluated we observed that intranasal delivery of vsv-846 induced a potent antigen-specific t cell response following a single dose and vsv-846 efficiently controlled bacterial growth to levels ∼10-fold lower than that observed in the mock group 6 weeks post-infection in bcg-infected mice importantly mice immunized with vsv-846 provided long-term protection against mycobacteria infection compared with those receiving p846 or bcg immunization increased memory t cells were also observed in the spleens of vsv-846-vaccinated mice which could be a potential mechanism associated with long-term protective immune response these findings supported the use of vsv as an antigen delivery vector with the potential for tb vaccine development
avian infectious bronchitis a highly contagious disease caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv is of considerable economic importance to the poultry industry new ibv tw-like strains have increasingly emerged in china in recent years hence evaluating their pathogenicity and developing a specific vaccine to guard against their potential threat to the poultry industry is important here we examined the pathogenicity of a tw-like ibv strain gd and evaluated the protective efficacy of the qx-like strain js against gd in challenge infections in chickens the results revealed that strain-gdinfected birds experienced severe respiratory signs renal lesions and 30-40% mortality the gd virus had extensive tissue tropism especially in the trachea lungs kidneys and bursa of fabricius and was continuously shed via the respiratory tract and cloaca the qx-like ibv strain js is able to completely protect chickens from challenge with the tw-like ibv gd field strain with no clinical signs or gross lesions decreased tissue replication rates lower ciliostasis score and reduced virus shedding these findings indicate that ibv gd is highly virulent and that qx-like js may serve as an effective vaccine against the threat posed by ibv tw-like viruses

vaccines for protection against respiratory infections should optimally induce a mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract in addition to a systemic immune response however current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity in order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations given either by the intranasal in or the intrapulmonary ipl route with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization the study was conducted in balb/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with gpi-0100 a saponin-derived adjuvant while optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost the latter strategy also resulted in the best t cell response yet it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung iga successful induction of secretory iga igg and t cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses citation liu h patil hp de vries-idema j wilschut j huckriede a 2013 evaluation of mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by gpi-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine delivered by different immunization strategies plos one 87 e69649
emerging viral diseases represent an ongoing challenge for globalized world and bats constitute an immense partially explored reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and as observed for human noroviruses they may impact on human health on a global scale by screening fecal samples of bats in hungary calicivirus rna was identified in the samples of myotis daubentonii and eptesicus serotinus bats in order to characterize more in detail the bat caliciviruses large portions of the genome sequence of the viruses were determined phylogenetic analyses and molecular modeling identified firmly the two viruses as candidate members within the caliciviridae family with one calicivirus strain resembling members of the sapovirus genus and the other bat calicivirus being more related to porcine caliciviruses of the proposed genus valovirus this data serves the effort for detecting reservoir hosts for potential emerging viruses and recognize important evolutionary relationships
the sabin vaccine institute product development partnership is developing a pan-anthelmintic vaccine that simultaneously targets the major soil-transmitted nematode infections in other words ascariasis trichuriasis and hookworm infection the approach builds off the current bivalent human hookworm vaccine now in clinical development and would ultimately add both a larval ascaris lumbricoides antigen and an adult-stage trichuris trichiura antigen from the parasite stichosome each selected antigen would partially reproduce the protective immunity afforded by uv-attenuated ascaris eggs and trichuris stichosome extracts respectively final antigen selection will apply a ranking system that includes the evaluation of expression yields and solubility feasibility of process development and the absence of circulating antigen-specific ige among populations living in helminth-endemic regions here we describe a five year roadmap for the antigen discovery feasibility and antigen selection which will ultimately lead to the scale-up expression process development manufacture good laboratory practices toxicology and preclinical evaluation ultimately leading to phase 1 clinical testing

background interest in porcine epidemic diarrhea has grown since the 2013 outbreak in the united states caused major losses with mortality rates up to 100 % in suckling piglets in mexico an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea characterized by 100 % mortality in piglets began in march 2014 in the state of mexico methods the aim of this study was to confirm and identify porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in samples from piglets with suggestive clinical signs using virological histological and molecular techniques necropsy was performed on 13 piglets from two litters with initial and advanced clinical signs suggestive lesions of acute infection with pedv were detected in histological sections of the small and large bowels specifically multiple virus particles with visible crown-shaped projections were observed using electron microscopy and negative staining viral isolation was performed in vero cells with trypsin infection was monitored by observation of cytopathic effect and titration was determined by tcid 50 /ml the presence of the pedv in cultures and clinical samples was confirmed by rt-pcr amplification and sequencing of a 651-bp segment of the s glycoprotein gene as well as a 681-bp matrix protein gene the nucleotide sequence analysis of the mexican isolates showed marked homology to viruses that circulated in 2013 in colorado usa conclusions in this paper we confirm the isolation and characterization of pedv from animals with early and advanced clinical signs
cryptosporidiosis causes life-threatening diarrhea in infants but the best available treatment is only modestly efficacious rodents infected with relevant cryptosporidium species do not develop diarrhea which complicates drug development cryptosporidium parvum infection of dairy calves however causes an illness like that seen in infants here the clinical and microbiologic anti-cryptosporidium efficacy of the piperazine-based compound mmv665917 was demonstrated in neonatal calves oral administration of mmv665917 22 mg/kg once daily was begun two days after the onset of severe diarrhea and continued for seven days treatment resulted in prompt resolution of diarrhea and reduced total fecal oocyst shedding by~94%. mmv665917 was useful for treatment rather than just prophylaxis since it was safe and effective when administered well after the onset of diarrhea furthermore even though all animals received intensive supportive care there was a strong trend towards improved secondary health outcomes including general health appetite and dehydration measures amongst treated animals these data establish mmv665917 as an outstanding lead compound for cryptosporidium drug development
viral pathogens have evolved a wide range of tactics to evade host immune responses and thus propagate effectively one efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope therefore it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal in this study we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 using this antibody we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope the vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization this antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch
the interaction between the enhancing and neutralizing activities of three monoclonal antibodies mabs 5-6-2 6-4-2 and 7-4-1 to the spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv strain 79-1146 was determined using feline macrophages at a high mab concentration all of the three mabs completely inhibited the fipv infection at 37 c however two of them 6-4-2 and 7-4-1 enhanced fipv infection when either the mab concentration or reaction temperature was lowered these mabs also exerted an immediate infectivity-enhancing activity for up to 10 min of reaction and by 20 min neutralizing activities were observed only mab 5-6-2 consistently showed neutralizing activity regardless of the reaction conditions competition with sera from cats experimentally infected with fipv strain 79-1146 or feline enteric coronavirus strain 79-1683 showed that the two epitopes recognized by mab 5-6-2 and mab 6-4-2 respectively are also recognized by the natural host
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is an immunosuppressive chronic respiratory viral disease of pigs that is responsible for major economic losses to the swine industry worldwide the efficacy of parenteral administration of widely used modified live virus prrs vaccine prrs-mlv against genetically divergent prrsv strains remains questionable therefore we evaluated an alternate and proven mucosal immunization approach by intranasal delivery of prrs-mlv strain vr2332 with a potent adjuvant to elicit cross-protective immunity against a heterologous prrsv strain mn184 mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate mtb wcl was chosen as a potent mucosal adjuvant due to its th1 biased immune response to prrs-mlv unvaccinated pigs challenged with mn184 had clinical prrs with severe lung pathology however vaccinated prrs-mlv+ mtb wcl pigs challenged with mn184 were apparently healthy there was a significant increase in the body weight gain in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated prrsv challenged pigs vaccinated compared to unvaccinated virus-challenged pigs had reduced lung pathology associated with enhanced prrsv neutralizing antibody titers and reduced viremia immunologically an increased frequency of th cells th/memory cells ␥␦ t cells dendritic cells and activated th cells and a reduced frequency of t-regulatory cells were detected at both mucosal and systemic sites further reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf-␤ and upregulation of the th1 cytokine ifn-␥ in blood and lungs were detected in mucosally vaccinated prrsvchallenged pigs in conclusion intranasal immunization of pigs with prrs-mlv administered with mtb wcl generated effective cross-protective immunity against prrsv
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a newly identified virus that causes watery diarrhea in newborn piglets and results in significant economic losses to the pig industry since first reported in hong kong in 2012 pdcov has been subsequently detected in usa south korea thailand and mainland china here we isolated a strain of pdcov named chn-gd-2016 from the intestinal content of a diseased newborn piglet with severe diarrhea in a pig farm in guangdong china pdcov chn-gd-2016 could be identified by immunofluorescence with pdcov specific rabbit antisera and typical crown-shaped particles with spiky surface projections of this pdcov were observed with electron microscopy genomic analysis showed that the pdcov chn-gd-2016 was closely related to other chinese pdcov strains with the highest sequence similarity with the strain chn/tianjin/2016 importantly inoculation of newborn piglets with 1 9 10 5 tcid 50 of chn-gd-2016 by oral feeding successfully reproduced clear clinical symptoms including vomiting dehydration and severe diarrhea in piglets in addition the virus rna in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation was detected macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed and viral antigen was also detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining collectively the data show in this study confirms that pdcov is present in guangdong china and is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets
in namibia is unique and found in such magnitude as has not been reported elsewhere in southern africa reasons as to why kudus appear to be exceptionally susceptible to rabies still remain speculative at best because the current severe rabies endemic in kudus continues to have an enormous negative impact on the namibian agricultural sector we set out to question existing dogmas regarding the epidemiology of the disease in a unique experimental setting in addition we explored effective measures to protect these antelopes although we were able to confirm high susceptibly of kudus for rabies and sporadic horizontal rabies virus transmission to contact animals we contend that these observations cannot plausibly explain the rapid spread of the disease in kudus over large territories since parenteral vaccination of free-roaming kudus is virtually impossible oral rabies vaccination using modified life virus vaccines with a high safety profile would be the ultimate solution to the problem in a proof-of-concept study using a 3rd generation oral rabies virus vaccine construct spbn gasgas we found evidence that kudus can be vaccinated by the oral route and protected against a subsequent rabies infection in a second phase more targeted studies need to be initiated by focusing on optimizing oral vaccine uptake and delivery

calfhood diseases have a major impact on the economic viability of cattle operations the second of this three part review series considers the management of diarrhoeic diseases in pre-weaned calves in neonatal calf diarrhoea oral rehydration therapy is the single most important therapeutic measure to be carried out by the farmer and is usually successful if instigated immediately after diarrhoea has developed continued feeding of milk or milk replacer to diarrhoeic calves is important to prevent malnourishment and weight loss in affected calves indiscriminative antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged whereas systemically ill calves can benefit from systemic antibiotic treatment for the prevention of septicaemia or concurrent diseases ancillary treatments and specific preventive measures are discussed eimeriosis has a high economic impact on the farming industries due to direct cost of treatment and calf losses but especially due to decreased performance of clinically as well as sub-clinically affected animals emphasis lies on prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment since the degree of damage to the intestinal mucosa once diarrhoea has developed makes therapeutic intervention unrewarding
milk contains a variety of substances which inhibit the infection of pathogens this is of benefit to the mother safeguarding the integrity of the lactating mammary gland but also of huge importance for protection of the suckling offspring the antimicrobial substances in milk can be classified into two categories first nonspecific broad-spectrum defense substances which have evolved over long periods of time and secondly substances like antibodies which are specifically directed against particular pathogens and have developed during the mother's lifetime substances in both categories may be targets for biological intervention and manipulation with the goal of improving the antimicrobial properties of milk these alterations of milk composition have applications in human as well as in animal health d
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. despite the wide range of distribution the virus cchfv is basically endemic in africa asia eastern europe and the middle east acute febrile illness associated with petechiae disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease with all these fatal effects cchfv is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease in the present study we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the rna-dependent rna polymerase-l of cchfv both the t-cell and b-cell epitopes were assessed and the epitope "dcsstppdr" was found to be the most potential one with 100% conservancy among all the strains of cchfv the epitope was also found to interact with both type i and ii major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well in vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production which might be an effective path to prevent cchf disease
an updated literature survey identified 1407 recognized species of human pathogen 58% of which are zoonotic of the total 177 are regarded as emerging or reemerging zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be in this category as are nonzoonotic pathogens emerging and reemerging pathogens are not strongly associated with particular types of nonhuman hosts but they are most likely to have the broadest host ranges emerging and reemerging zoonoses are associated with a wide range of drivers but changes in land use and agriculture and demographic and societal changes are most commonly cited however although zoonotic pathogens do represent the most likely source of emerging and reemerging infectious disease only a small minority have proved capable of causing major epidemics in the human population
there are four outcomes to feline coronavirus fcov infection the development of feline infectious peritonitis fip which is immune-mediated subclinical infection development of healthy lifelong carriers and a small minority of cats who resist infection addie and jarrett veterinary record 148 2001 649 examination of the fcov genome has shown that the same strain of virus can produce different clinical manifestations suggesting that host genetic factors may also play a role in the outcome of infection fip is most prevalent amongst pedigree cats although how much of this is due to them living in large groups leading to higher virus challenge and stress which predisposes to fip and how much is due to genetic susceptibility is not known if host genetics could be shown to play a role in disease it may allow the detection of cats with a susceptibility to fip and the development of increased population resistance through selective breeding the feline leucocyte antigen fla complex contains many genes that are central to the control of the immune response in this preliminary study we used clonal sequence analysis or reference strand conformational analysis rsca to analyse the class ii fla-drb of 25 cats for which the outcome of fcov exposure was known individual cats were shown to have between two and six fla-drb alleles there was no statistically significant association between the number of alleles and the outcome of fcov infection no particular allele appeared to be associated with either the development of fip resistance to fcov or the carrier status however the analysis was complicated by apparent breed variation in fla-drb and the small number of individuals in this study
various methods for the control of prrs virus have been published the technology of nursery depopulation nd appears to effectively control the spread of virus between members of endemically infected populations nd consists of a strategic adjustment in pigflow based on the presence of specific serologic patterns as detected by the indirect fluorescent antibody test this pattern indicates a low seroprevalence of antibodies detected in the breeding herd and recently weaned piglets i 10%. in contrast to a high > 50% seroprevalence in 8 to 10 week old piglets nd has been carried out on swine farms in the us and results indicate improvements in nursery piglet growth rate and mortality levels three examples are provided in the following text recently a modified live virus vaccine respprrs nobl laboratories/boerhinger ingleheim has become commercially available it is currently approved for use in piglets from 3 to 18 weeks of age however potential for the use in adult animals is currently under investigation 0 1997 elsevier science b v
infectious bronchitis ib is a highly infectious viral disease responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry a reverse genetic vaccine is a safe rapid and effective method of achieving ib prevention and control in this study we constructed the recombinant strain rh120-s1/yz using a reverse genetic system based on the backbone of the h120 vaccine strain with the s1 gene replaced with that of the qx-like nephropathogenic strain ck/ch/ibyz/2011 isolated in china the results of dwarf chicken embryos growth kinetics and viral titration in the embryos demonstrated that the biological characteristics of the recombinant virus remained unchanged like the rh120-infected group and in contrast to the ribyz-infected group no mortality clinical signs or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rh120-s1/yz the viral loads in various tissues cloacal and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples indicating that the rh120-s1/yz strain was highly safe in chicks compared to rh120 vaccination group when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the qxlike ibv strain better protection with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rh120-s1/yz increased levels of ibv-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rh120-s1/yz-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination collectively our results suggest that the recombinant strain rh120-s1/yz may represent a promising vaccine candidate against qx-like ibvs
background porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a lethal infectious disease in suckling piglets with symptoms including watery diarrhea caused by ped virus pedv since the late 1990's live vaccines based on genogroup 1 virus have been used in japan and a significant amount of the vaccine has been used even after new genogroups invaded in 2013 in this study we evaluated the effect of a conventional ped live vaccine on a newly prevalent genogroup 2 field strain in experimental and field situations methods two pregnant sows were administered twice the live vaccine before farrowing a pregnant sow was served as a negative control all newborn piglets were challenged with the genogroup 2 virus and clinical signs were monitored for 7 days post challenge pedv-specific immune responses in serum and milk of the sows were assayed by virus neutralization assay the efficacy of ped live vaccine in vaccinated or non-vaccinated farms was evaluated by comparing the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of ped results the challenged piglets exhibited watery diarrhea with or without vaccination however the clinical score of piglets born from vaccinated sows significantly improved after the 4th day of the challenge the survival rate of piglets in the vaccinated group at the end of the experimental period was 80% whereas in the control group was 0%. neutralizing antibody titers in serum and milk of control sow was negative throughout the experimental period whereas high titers were observed in the vaccinated sows the vaccinated farms significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of ped compared to farms not vaccinated conclusions the conventional ped live vaccine induced the lactogenic immunity to vaccinated sows and showed partial protection against the genogroup 2 virus both under the experimental and field conditions
bats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation pollination seed dispersal and soil fertilization bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses such as coronaviruses covs the islands of the western indian ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot with more than 50 bat species in this study we tested 1013 bats belonging to 36 species from mozambique madagascar mauritius mayotte reunion island and seychelles based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene in total 88 bats 8.7% tested positive for coronaviruses with higher prevalence in mozambican bats 20.5% ± 4.9% as compared to those sampled on islands 4.5% ± 1.5%. phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of αand β-covs and a strong signal of co-evolution between covs and their bat host species with limited evidence for host-switching except for bat species sharing day roost sites these results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island future studies should investigate whether covs detected in these bats have a potential for spillover in other hosts
feline infectious peritonitis fip virus antigen was demonstrated after methanol ethanol or formalin fixation in paraffin-embedded tissues by means of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies the monoclonal antibody was induced by immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis virus polyclonal antibodies were obtained by purification on protein a-sepharose of ascites fluid from a cat with fip almost all cats diagnosed as suffering from fip by postmortem and histological examination exhibited fip virus fipv antigen in macrophages in granulomas whereas fipv antigen was only once demonstrable in another location
subterranean cavities serve as resting places and hibernation shelters for mosquitoes in europe members of the genus culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls culex pipiens l the common house mosquito exists in two physically very similar yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes or forms 'f.' namely cx pipiens f pipiens and cx pipiens f molestus autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats the epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in eastern austria but the hypogean distribution of the cx pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as cx torrentium is unknown considering the key role of culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate for a first pertinent investigation in austria we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states based on analyses of the ace2 gene and the cq11 microsatellite locus 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus culex two females of the genus culiseta and a single female of the genus anopheles were determined to species level or below in our catches cx pipiens f pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted cx pipiens f molestus many times over records of cx hortensis and cx territans two species rarely collected in austria lead us to infer that underground habitats host a higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes than previously thought
the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov spike protein s is a major target for neutralizing antibodies retroviral sars-cov s pseudotypes have been constructed and used to develop an in vitro microneutralization assay that is both sensitive and specific for sars-cov neutralizing antibodies neutralization titers measured by this assay are highly correlated to those measured by an assay using replicationcompetent sars-cov no cross-neutralization occurred with human sera known to contain antibodies to coronavirus strains oc43 and 229e the pseudotype assay was used to profile neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov s in sequential serum samples taken from 41 confirmed sars patients during the 2003 outbreak in hong kong and shows long-lasting immunity in most recovered patients the pseudotype assay does not require handling live sars virus it is a useful tool to determine neutralizing titers during natural infection and the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov causes severe respiratory infection and continues to infect humans thereby contributing to a high mortality rate 34.3% in 2019 in the absence of an available licensed vaccine and antiviral agent therapeutic human antibodies have been suggested as candidates for treatment in this study human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by sorting b cells from patient's pbmc cells with prefusion stabilized spike s probes and a direct immunoglobulin cloning strategy we identified six receptor-binding domain rbd-specific and five s1 non-rbd-specific antibodies among which only the rbd-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing potency ic 50 0.006-1.787 μg/ml as well as high affinity to rbd notably passive immunization using a highly potent antibody knih90-f1 at a relatively low dose 2 mg/kg completely protected transgenic mice expressing human dpp4 against mers-cov lethal challenge these results suggested that human monoclonal antibodies isolated by using the rationally designed prefusion mers-cov s probe could be considered potential candidates for the development of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antiviral agents for mers-cov human infection

heightened surveillance of acute febrile illness in china since 2004 led to the identification of a severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts with unknown etiology sporadic patients hospitalized with sfts in 2009 and 2010 were identified and serum samples were collected sequence from a novel species of phlebovirus was identified by sequence independent single primer amplification sispa from the serum of a patient with sfts the virus was isolated in vero cell culture and its complete genome sequence was determined only distantly related to other known phleboviruses electron microscopic analysis revealed a virion morphologically characteristic of phleboviruses the virus was named as sfts virus the viral rna and/or specific antibodies were detected from the blood of patients with sfts serological assays demonstrated a virus-specific immune response in pairs of sera collected from patients at acute and convalescent phases the pathogenic mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in human sfts disease was resembled in a mouse model the results had been collected to demonstrate that sfts virus was etiologically associated with an acute and novel infectious disease sfts in humans
lactic acid bacteria lab are major microorganisms used for probiotic purposes and prime parts of the human and mammalian gut microbiota which exert important health-promoting effects on the host the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the probiotic potential and safety of lab strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wild boar from the greater khingan mountains china amongst all of the isolated lab strains five isolates identified as lactobacillus mucosae lactobacillus salivarius enterococcus hirae enterococcus durans and enterococcus faecium were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt the probiotic characteristics including adhesion capability antimicrobial activities autoaggregation and coaggregation abilities and safety properties including hemolytic activity antibiotic resistance absence/presence of virulence factors and in vivo safety were evaluated the results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential remarkable aggregation capacity and antibacterial activities upon assessment of the safety these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes in vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice this study revealed that these lab isolates especially l salivarius m2-71 possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health
an inactivated vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was evaluated in rhesus monkeys the monkeys were inoculated intramuscularly i m with 0.5 5 50 or 5000 g of vaccine or pbs as control and boosted on day 7 after 3 weeks they were challenged with the ns-1 strain of sars-cov the humoral and mucosal immune responses clinical signs chemical indices and viremia were monitored following the immunization and challenge the control animals who received pbs developed atypical sar-cov infection after viral challenge according to clinical virological and pathological findings no systematic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization even in at the high dose of 5000 g the 50 g dosage of vaccine elicited sars-cov specific immune responses against viral infection as compared to the partial immunity elicited by 0.5 and 5 g doses the results show that this inactivated vaccine can induce effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against sars-cov infection is safe in monkeys and the vaccine maybe a good candidate for clinical trials
emerging viruses such as ebola virus ebov lassa virus lasv and avian influenza virus h5n1 aiv are global health concerns since there is very limited options either vaccine or specific therapy approved for humans against these viruses there is an urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic treatments previously we reported a high-throughput screening hts protocol to identify entry inhibitors for three highly pathogenic viruses ebov lasv and aiv using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyping platform which allows us to perform the screening in a bsl-2 facility in this report we have adopted this screening protocol to evaluate traditional chinese medicines tcms in an effort to discover entry inhibitors against these viruses here we show that extracts of the following chinese medicinal herbs exhibit potent anti-ebola viral activities gardenia jasminoides ellis citrus aurantium l viola yedoensis makino prunella vulgaris l coix lacryma-jobi l var mayuen roman stapf pinellia ternata thunb breit and morus alba l this study represents a proof-of-principle investigation supporting the suitability of this assay for rapid screening tcms and identifying putative entry inhibitors for these viruses
veterinary vaccines need to have desired characteristics such as being effective inexpensive easy to administer suitable for mass vaccination and stable under field conditions dna vaccines have been proposed as potential solutions for poultry diseases since they are subunit vaccines with no risk of infection or reversion to virulence dna vaccines can be utilized for simultaneous immunizations against multiple pathogens and are relatively easy to design and inexpensive to manufacture and store administration of dna vaccines has been shown to stimulate immune responses and provide protection from challenges in different animal models although dna vaccines offer advantages setbacks including the inability to induce strong immunity and the fact that they are not currently applicable for mass vaccination impede the use of dna vaccines in the poultry industry the use of either biological or physical carriers has been proposed as a solution to overcome the current delivery limitations of dna vaccines for veterinary applications this review presents an overview of the recent development of carriers for delivery of veterinary dna vaccines against avian pathogens
in brazil rabies surveillance is based on monitoring domestic and wild animals although the most prevalent lineage of the rabies virus rabv currently diagnosed in brazil is associated with bats particularly non-haematophagous bats disease control is based on the mass vaccination of dogs and cats we used data collected by the passive surveillance system of the city of campinas from 2011 to 2015 to describe the temporal and geographic distributions of the bat specimens and rabv and discuss the current rabies surveillance with the advent of the declaration of canine and feline rabies-free areas in brazil we described the species locations and health statuses of the collected bat specimens moreover all samples were submitted for rabv diagnosis then we performed a time series decomposition for each bat family additionally we determined the spatiotemporal relative risk for rabv infection using the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of rabv-positive and rabv-negative bats from the 2537 bat specimens the most numerous family was molossidae 72% followed by vespertilionidae 14% and phyllostomidae 13%. the bat families behaved differently in terms of seasonal and spatial patterns the distribution of bats varied geographically in the urban environment with molossidae and phyllostomidae being observed downtown and vespertilionidae being observed in peripheral zones concurrently a significant relative risk of rabv infection was observed downtown for vespertilionidae and in peripheral zones for molossidae no rabv-positive sample clusters were observed as a result of the official declaration of rabv-free areas in southern brazil mass dog and cat vaccinations are expected to halt in the near future this stoppage would make most dog and cat populations susceptible to other rabv lineages such as those maintained by non-haematophagous bats in this scenario all information available on bats and rabv distribution in urban areas is essential currently few studies have been conducted some local health authorities such as that in campinas are spontaneously basing their surveillance efforts on bat rabies which is the alternative in reality scenario of increased susceptibility to bat-associated rabv that is developing in brazil
for many encephalitis cases the cause remains unidentifi ed after 2 children from the same family received a diagnosis of acute necrotizing encephalopathy at centre hospitalier universitaire tours france we attempted to identify the etiologic agent because clinical samples from the 2 patients were negative for all pathogens tested urine and throat swab specimens were added to epithelial cells and virus isolates detected were characterized by molecular analysis and electron microscopy we identifi ed a novel reovirus strain serotype 2 mrv2tou05 which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains a specifi c antibody response directed against this new reovirus strain was observed in convalescent-phase serum specimens from the patients whereas no response was observed in 38 serum specimens from 38 healthy adults this novel reovirus is a new etiologic agent of encephalitis
the isolation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies nmabs against the zika virus zikv might lead to novel preventative strategies for infections in at-risk individuals primarily pregnant women here we describe the characterization of human mabs from the plasmablasts of an acutely infected patient one of the 18 mabs had the unusual feature of binding to and neutralizing zikv despite not appearing to have been diversified by affinity maturation this mab neutralized zikv neut 50~2 μg/ml but did not react with any of the four dengue virus serotypes except for the expected junctional diversity created by the joining of the v-d-j genes there was no deviation from immunoglobulin germline genes this is a rare example of a human mab with neutralizing activity in the absence of detectable somatic hypermutation importantly binding of this mab to zikv was specifically inhibited by human plasma from zikv-exposed individuals suggesting that it may be of value in a diagnostic setting
the recombinant antigen obtained by cloning and expressing two ibv nucleocapsid protein fragments 143-414 aa 281-414 aa in escherichia coli was used for the detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv specific antibodies in chicken sera by the indirect elisa rnpibv-elisa as a result of testing 1524 serum samples the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of rnpibv-elisa when comparing those of the routine whole ibv elisa have been shown to be 93.81% and 87.36% respectively the agreement value was 91.5%.
feline coronavirus fcov is divided into two types i and ii based on their growth in vitro and antigenicity in this study virus neutralization vn test was applied for type differentiation of fcovinfections sera of cats which were clinically and serologically diagnosed as feline infectious peritonitis fip possessed significantly higher vn titers to type i fcov and sera from cats experimentally infected with fipv type ii had high vn titers to type ii but not type i viruses a total of 79 cat sera collected in the years between 2004 and 2005 were examined to evaluate seroprevalence by the vn test showing the following results 1 50 cats 63.3% were sero-positive to fcov 2 of the 50 fcov positive cat serum samples 49 98% showed significantly higher titers to type i virus and only one 2% for type ii virus these results indicate that the vn test described here can be used for serological differentiation of fcov infections of cats and that fcov type i is a dominant type in recent years of japan #

the virome has been increasingly investigated in numerous animal species and in different sites of the body facilitating the identification and discovery of a variety of viruses in spite of this the faecal virome of healthy dogs has not been investigated in this study we describe the faecal virome of healthy dogs and dogs with acute diarrhoea in australia using a shotgun metagenomic approach viral sequences from a range of different virus families including both rna and dna families and known pathogens implicated in enteric disease were documented twelve viral families were identified of which four were bacteriophages eight eukaryotic viral families were detected astroviridae coronaviridae reoviridae picornaviridae caliciviridae parvoviridae adenoviridae and papillomaviridae families astroviridae picornaviridae and caliciviridae were found only in dogs with acute diarrhoea with astroviridae being the most common family identified in this group due to its prevalence characterisation the complete genome of a canine astrovirus was performed these studies indicate that metagenomic analyses are useful for the investigation of viral populations in the faeces of dogs further studies to elucidate the epidemiological and biological relevance of these findings are warranted
knowledge of etiology causes of diarrheal illness is essential for development and implementation of public health measures to prevent and control this disease syndrome there are few published studies examining diarrhea in children aged <5 years in iraq this study aims to investigate the occurrences and epidemiology of selected bacterial salmonella spp and campylobacter spp viral adenovirus norovirus gi and gii and astrovirus and parasitic entamoeba spp and giardia spp agents in stool samples from 155 child diarrheal cases enrolled between march and august 2017 in a hospital-based cross-sectional study in thi-qar southeastern iraq using molecular techniques and sequence-based characterization adenovirus was the most frequently detected enteropathogen 53/155 34.2% followed by salmonella spp 23/155 14.8% entamoeba spp 21/155 13.5% and campylobacter spp 17/155 10.9%. mixed infection with salmonella spp and campylobacter spp was evident and the same was revealed between various enteric viruses particularly adenovirus and norovirus the most frequent co-infection pattern was between adenovirus and campylobacter spp in seven cases 7/155 4.5%. whole-genome sequencing-derived typing data for salmonella isolates n = 23 revealed that sequence type 49 was the most prevalent in this sample set 15/23 65.2%. to the best of our knowledge this study provides the first report on detection and identification of flor bla carb-2 and mpha antimicrobial resistance genes in salmonella isolated from children in the middle east region logistic regression analysis pointed to few enteropathogen-specific correlations between child age household water source and breastfeeding patterns in relation to the outcome of detection of individual enteropathogens this study presents the first published molecular investigation of multiple enteropathogens among children <5 years of age in iraq our data provide supporting evidence for planning of childhood diarrhea management programs it is important to build on this study and develop future longitudinal case-control research in order to elaborate the epidemiology of enteropathogens in childhood diarrhea in iraq
recent epidemics of west nile virus wnv around the world have been associated with significant rates of mortality and morbidity in humans to develop standard wnv diagnostic tools that can differentiate wnv from japanese encephalitis virus jev four monoclonal antibodies mabs specific to wnv envelope e protein were produced and characterized by isotyping reactivity with denatured and native antigens affinity assay immunofluorescence assay ifa and epitope competition as well as cross-reactivity with jev two of the mabs 6a11 and 4b3 showed stronger reactivity with e protein than the others 2f5 and 6h7 in western blot analysis 4b3 could bind with denatured antigen as well as native antigens in indirect elisa flow cytometry analysis and ifa whereas 2f5 showed highest affinity with native antigen 4b3 and 2f5 were therefore used to establish an antigen capture-elisa ac-elisa detection system the sensitivity of this ac-elisa was 3.95 tcid 50 /0.1 ml for wnv-infected cell culture supernatant notably these mabs showed no cross-reactivity with jev which suggests that they are useful for further development of highly sensitive easy handling and less time-consuming detection kits/tools in wnv surveillance in areas where jev is epidemic
there have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis ms and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades however in every case further research has disproved the original claim thus we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid csf of three patients with ms and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the patients yielding the isolates from their csf possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system cns diseases studied at the same time the virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the cns the agent has not yet been adequately address reprint requests to dr
background venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev is responsible for vee epidemics that occur in south and central america and the u s the veev envelope contains two glycoproteins e1 mediates cell membrane fusion and e2 binds receptor and elicits virus neutralizing antibodies previously we constructed e1 and e2 epitope maps using murine monoclonal antibodies mmabs six e2 epitopes e2 cdefgh bound veev-neutralizing antibody and mapped to amino acids aa 182-207 nothing is known about the human antibody repertoire to veev or epitopes that engage human virusneutralizing antibodies there is no specific treatment for vee however virus-neutralizing mmabs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with veev by either peripheral or aerosol routes therefore fully human mabs hmabs with virus-neutralizing activity should be useful for prevention or clinical treatment of human vee methods we used phage-display to isolate veev-specific hfabs from human bone marrow donors these hfabs were characterized by sequencing specificity testing veev subtype cross-reactivity using indirect elisa and in vitro virus neutralization capacity one e2-specific neutralizing hfab f5n was converted into igg and its binding site was identified using competitive elisa with mmabs and by preparing and sequencing antibody neutralization-escape variants findings using 11 veev-reactive hfabs we constructed the first human epitope map for the alphaviral surface proteins e1 and e2 we identified an important neutralization-associated epitope unique to the human immune response e2 aa115-119 using a 9 å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of the sindbis virus e2 protein we showed the probable surface location of this human veev epitope the veev-neutralizing capacity of the hmab f5 nigg is similar to that exhibited by the humanized mmab hy4 igg the hy4 igg has been shown to limit veev infection in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically administration of a cocktail of f5n and hy4 iggs which bind to different e2 epitopes could provide enhanced prophylaxis or immunotherapy for veev while reducing the possibility of generating possibly harmful virus neutralization-escape variants in vivo

bovine eimeriosis is considered to be of considerable importance for the productivity and health of cattle worldwide despite the importance of cattle farming in austria little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine eimeria spp the objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different eimeria spp on austrian dairy farms fecal samples from individual calves n0868 from 296 farms all over austria 82 districts were collected additionally each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures on 97.97% of the investigated farms calves excreted eimeria oocysts and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive after sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm 11 eimeria species were found with e bovis in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms e zuernii 63.85%/13.86% e auburnensis 56.76%/13.41% and e ellipsoidalis 54.05%/14.38% being the most prevalent followed by e alabamensis 45.61%/11.56% e subspherica 35.14%/5.5.05% e cylindrica 33.11%/7.00% and e canadensis 31.08%/7.74%. e wyomingensis e pellita and e bukidnonensis were only found sporadically 3.04-4.73% of the samples and 0.16-0.59% of the farms mixed infections were present on all farms 2-9 eimeria species/ farm prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1-87.9% of the samples and 93.8-100% of the farms lower austria had the highest percentage of positive farms and vorarlberg the lowest individual opg oocysts per gram of feces values were generally low 75% of the samples had an opg of 1000 or less the highest detected opg was 72400 the mean opg was 2525 with above average numbers in tirol carinthia and lower austria the mean opg values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts the majority of the samples were from female simmenthal calves clinical coccidiosis diarrhea was observed in 74 cases and semi-liquid diarrhea 56 animals was significantly correlated with opg p<0.05 linear regression on the opg data showed that opg values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves while the percentage of positive samples increased with age p<0.05 for both the term "coccidia" was familiar to 45% of the farmers and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them most commonly with toltrazuril considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians
porcine enteric alphacoronavirus peav is a newly identified swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea in newborn piglets in this study an original highly virulent peav strain gds04 was serially passaged in vero cells the virus titers and sizes of syncytia increased gradually with the cell passages newborn piglets were orally inoculated with peav p15 p67 and p100 compared with p15 and p67 p100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets the virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in p100-inoculated piglets importantly all p100-inoculated newborn piglets survived indicating that p100 was an attenuated variant sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain gds04 had four one six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane nucleocapsid spike and orf1ab proteins respectively from p100 furthermore more differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of s protein between gds04 and p100 were observed indicating that these differences might be associated with the pathogenicity of peav collectively our research successfully prepared a peav attenuated variant which might serve as a live attenuated vaccine candidate against peav infection
acute lower respiratory tract infections lrtis are a major worldwide health problem particularly in childhood about 30e50% of acute lrtis are viral in origin of these influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are associated with the greatest disease burden in humans many different influenza a viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics the pandemic h1n1 influenza virus that emerged in humans in 2009 contained a unique combination of genes originating in swine and the global human population was highly susceptible to the novel strain the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003 and the ensuing worldwide epidemic highlights the fact that respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals preventative measures for influenza include annual vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir subtype-dependent resistance to antivirals can develop and should be closely monitored
background the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai virus h5n1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry in addition it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high 60% mortality rate effective vaccination against hpai h5n1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission in the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin sh5 3 produced in mammalian cells the secreted purified sh5 3 was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner it was shown to protect chickens in a dosedependent manner against a lethal challenge with h5n1 after a single vaccination protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative rt-pcr on rna isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs also in mice vaccination with sh5 3 provided complete protection against challenge with hpai h5n1 conclusions/significance our results demonstrate that sh5 3 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against hpai h5n1 as these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses citation cornelissen lahm de vries rp de boer-luijtze ea rigter a rottier pjm et al 2010 a single immunization with soluble recombinant trimeric hemagglutinin protects chickens against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 plos one 55 e10645
tuberculosis tb an infectious disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb kills 5000 people per day globally rapid development and spread of various multi drug-resistant strains of mtb emphasize that an effective vaccine is still the most cost-effectives and efficient way of controlling and eradicating tb bacillus calmette-guerin bcg the only licensed tb vaccine still remains the most widely administered human vaccine but is inefficient in protecting from pulmonary tb in adults the protective immunity afforded by bcg is thought to wane with time and considered to last only through adolescent years heterologous boosting of bcg-primed immune responses using a subunit vaccine represents a promising vaccination approach to promote strong cellular responses against mtb in our earlier studies we discovered lipopeptides of esat-6 antigen with strong potential as a subunit vaccine candidate here we have investigated that potential as a booster to bcg vaccine in both a pre-exposure preventive vaccine and a post-exposure therapeutic vaccine setting surprisingly our results demonstrated that boosting bcg with subunit vaccine shortly before mtb challenge did not improve the bcg-primed immunity whereas the subunit vaccine boost after mtb challenge markedly improved the quantity and quality of effector t cell responses and significantly reduced mtb load in lungs liver and spleen in mice these studies suggest that esat-6 lipopeptide-based subunit vaccine was ineffective in overcoming the apparent immunomodulation induced by bcg vaccine in mtb uninfected mice but upon infection the subunit vaccine is effective in re-educating the protective immunity against mtb infection these important results have significant implications in the design and investigation of effective vaccine strategies and immunotherapeutic approaches for individuals who have been pre-immunized with bcg vaccine but still get infected with mtb
a major advantage of dna vaccination is the ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses dna vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies however recent clinical data have re-established the value of dna vaccines particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses several approaches have been investigated for improving dna vaccine efficacy including advancements in dna vaccine vector design the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants and novel non-mechanical delivery methods these strategies have shown promise resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice but also in large animal models here we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of dna vaccines
coxsackievirus b5 cv-b5 an important coxsackie b virus from genus enteroviruse within the family picornaviridae has also been isolated from hand foot and mouth disease hfmd patients and often associated with neurological manifestations in this study we found out that coxsackievirus b3 cv-b3 replicon rna could be encapsidated with cv-b5 capsid to assemble infectious cv-b5 pseudovirus we then utilized this single round infection system of cv-b5 to develop a neutralizing antibody quantification assay this pseudovirus neutralization assay showed superiority in biosafety sensibility quantitativity efficiency and high throughput and would facilitate the epidemiological studies and vaccine development of cv-b5
induced host immune response but the relative contribution of each remains largely unknown for example c57bl/6 b6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus jhm strain jhmv develop severe encephalitis with death occurring within 7 days here we show that the host response to a single jhmvspecific immunodominant cd4 t-cell epitope is critical for severe disease we engineered a recombinant jhmv with mutations in the immunodominant cd4 t-cell epitope rj m y135q . infection of naïve b6 mice with this virus resulted in mild disease with no mortality however introduction of a cd4 t-cell epitope from listeria monocytogenes into rj m y135q generated a highly virulent virus the decrease in disease severity was not due to a switch from th1 to th2 predominance in rj m y135q -infected mice an effect on cd8 t-cell function or differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-␣ by jhmv-specific cd4 t cells these results show that the response to a single virus-specific cd4 t-cell epitope may contribute to a pathogenic host response in the setting of acute viral disease and that abrogation of this response ameliorates clinical disease without diminishing virus clearance
the development of an effective vaccine is critical for prevention of a middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov pandemic some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain rbd protein of mers-cov spike s is a good candidate antigen for a mers-cov subunit vaccine however highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic we hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen therefore the immunogenicity of a novel mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes different vaccination regimens were compared in balb/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly i m with a vaccine containing 10 mg of recombinant mers-cov rbd in combination with either aluminium hydroxide alum alone alum and polyriboinosinic acid poly ic or alum and cysteine-phosphateguanine cpg oligodeoxynucleotides odn the immune responses of mice vaccinated with rbd incomplete freund's adjuvant ifa and cpg odn by a subcutaneous s c route were also investigated we evaluated the induction of rbdspecific humoral immunity total igg and neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity elispot assay for ifn-c spotforming cells and splenocyte cytokine production our findings indicated that the combination of alum and cpg odn optimized the development of rbd-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination interestingly robust rbd-specific antibody and t-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rrbd protein in combination with ifa and cpg odn but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes the vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the mers-cov subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses

bacteroides fragilis is considered an important clinical pathogen and the most common anaerobe isolated from human and animal clinical specimens enterotoxigenic strains produce diarrhea the presence of enterotoxigenic etbf and nonenterotoxigenic b fragilis in stool samples from calves with or without acute diarrhea and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains were evaluated the stool samples were plated onto a selective b fragilis-bile-esculin agar and incubated anaerobically 10% co 2 /90% n 2 at 37 1c for 72 h species of the b fragilis group were identified by using the api 32-a kit enterotoxigenic strains were detected by pcr and the cytotoxic assay from 54 diarrhea and 54 nondiarrhea stools 124 and 92 members of the b fragilis group respectively were recovered only two etbf strains were isolated from two different diarrhea samples and the bft gene was detected in both moreover the bft gene was detected in dna from four different diarrheal stools samples but no etbf strain was recovered all the bacteria were susceptible to chloramphenicol imipenem moxifloxacin piperacillin/tazobactam metronidazole and tigecycline most of the isolates from both calves with and without diarrhea were resistant to all metals our results are of concern and suggest the need to increase the surveillance of antibiotic and metal resistance of this microbial group isolated from animal production such as calves
waddlia chondrophila an obligate intracellular bacterium of the chlamydiales order is considered as an agent of bovine abortion and a likely cause of miscarriage in humans its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its dna in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis to better define the role of waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of waddlia seropositivity is needed therefore enriched outer membrane proteins of w chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific elisa after thorough analytical optimization the elisa was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity the elisa was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of w chondrophila in pneumonia overall 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against w chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins the major waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera the new elisa represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications although no association with pneumonia and waddlia seropositivity was observed this elisa could be used to specify the role of w chondrophila in miscarriage and in other diseases
the nature of influenza virus to randomly mutate and evolve into new types is an important challenge in the control of influenza infection it is necessary to monitor virus evolution for a better understanding of the pandemic risk posed by certain variants as evidenced by the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai viruses this has been clearly recognized in egypt following the notification of the first hpai h5n1 outbreak the continuous circulation of the virus and the mass vaccination programme undertaken in poultry have resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and a significant antigenic drift near the major antigenic sites in order to establish if vaccination is sufficient to provide significant intra-and interclade cross-protection lentiviral pseudotypes derived from h5n1 hpai viruses a/vietnam/1194/04 a/chicken/egypt-1709-01/2007 and an antigenic drift variant a/chicken/egypt-1709-06-2008 were constructed and used in pseudotype-based neutralization assays pp-nt pp-nt data obtained was confirmed and correlated with hi and mn assays a panel of pseudotypes belonging to influenza groups 1 and 2 with a combination of reporter systems was also employed for testing avian sera in order to support further application of pp-nt as an alternative valid assay that can improve avian vaccination efficacy testing vaccine virus selection and the reliability of reference sera
one sentence summary this review summarizes recent discoveries on the genetic and phenotypic traits required for airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes h5 h7 and h9 and pandemic viruses of subtypes h1 h2 and h3 many respiratory viruses of humans originate from animals for instance there are now eight paramyxoviruses four coronaviruses and four orthomxoviruses that cause recurrent epidemics in humans but were once confined to other hosts in the last decade several members of the same virus families have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans fortunately these viruses have not become established in humans because they lacked the ability of sustained transmission between humans however these outbreaks highlighted the lack of understanding of what makes a virus transmissible in part triggered by the relatively high frequency of occurrence of influenza a virus zoonoses and pandemics the influenza research community has started to investigate the viral genetic and biological traits that drive virus transmission via aerosols or respiratory droplets between mammals here we summarize recent discoveries on the genetic and phenotypic traits required for airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes h5 h7 and h9 and pandemic viruses of subtypes h1 h2 and h3 increased understanding of the determinants and mechanisms of respiratory virus transmission is not only key from a basic scientific perspective but may also aid in assessing the risks posed by zoonotic viruses to human health and preparedness for such risks
pigeon circovirus picv is the most frequently diagnosed virus in pigeons and is thought to be one of the causative factors of a complex disease called the young pigeon disease syndrome ypds the development of a vaccine against this virus could be a strategy for ypds control since laboratory culture of picv is impossible its recombinant capsid protein rcp can be considered as a potential antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines the aim of this basic research was to evaluate the immune response of pigeons to picv rcp sixty six-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into two groups experimental immunized with picv rcp mixed with an adjuvant and control immunized with an adjuvant only and immunized twice in a 21-day interval on the day of immunization and on two 23 39 and 46 days post first immunization dpv samples of blood spleen and bursa of fabricius were collected from six birds from each group to examine anti-picv rcp igy anti-picv rcp igy-secreting b cells sbc ifn-γ gene expression and percentage of t cd3 + cd4 + cd8 + and b igm + lymphocytes the results indicated a correct immune response to picv rcp both in humoral and cell-mediated immunity which was manifested by seroconversion since 23 dpv by a significantly higher anti-picv rcp igy-sbc number on two and 23 dpv and significantly higher ifn-γ gene expression since two dpv there were no significant differences or trends noted between particular t and b lymphocyte subpopulations to conclude picv rcp may be deemed immunogenic and could be considered as an antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines against picv infections in pigeons

two studies were conducted in the eimeria zuernii infection model in order to investigate the pathology of e zuernii coccidiosis and the efficacy of toltrazuril baycox 5% suspension in this infection for this purpose a total of 30 calves were infected experimentally with e zuernii oocysts and faecal samples taken regularly from the rectum and examined for faecal consistency and oocyst excretion six of the calves underwent pathological examination at various points in time after infection significant macroscopic and microscopic changes were demonstrated and parasitic stages were identified in the intestinal mucosa of infected calves during the late prepatent and patent period inflammatory reactions revealed by light microscopy were confirmed by electron microscopical investigations treatment of calves with toltrazuril during the late prepatent period resulted in significantly lower frequencies of diarrhoea and levels of oocyst excretion and weight gain was significantly higher than in shamtreated animals d
we have assessed the potency of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine in beef herds in argentina two different vaccine trials were conducted in a small-scale experimental trial involving 21 pregnant cows 13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of anvaccinated controls seven days after birth half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned secondly a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows in 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations in the other six herds control groups were used to compare data of the same year 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested where other enteropathogens such as cryptosporidium and coronaviruses were present together with rotavirus
the human gut is known to be a reservoir of a wide variety of microbes including viruses many rna viruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis however the enteric rna viral community present in healthy humans has not been described here we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of the rna viruses found in three fecal samples from two healthy human individuals for this study uncultured viruses were concentrated by tangential flow filtration and viral rna was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cdna libraries for sequencing analysis the vast majority of the 36769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic rna viruses the most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus pmmv which was found in high concentrations-up to 10 9 virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter pmmv was also detected in 12 66.7% of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population a number of pepper-based foods tested positive for pmmv suggesting dietary origins for this virus intriguingly the fecal pmmv was infectious to host plants suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses citation zhang t breitbart m lee wh run j wei cl et al 2006 rna viral community in human feces prevalence of plant pathogenic viruses plos biol 41 e3
the resistance of immunized mice to challenge with the same or a different strain of mouse hepatitis virus mhv was examined as a model of challenge immunity to coronavirus infection genetically susceptible balb/ cbyj mice were given an intranasal immunizing infection of respiratory-type mhv-jhm mhv-s or enterotropic mhv-y control mice were sham-immunized with sterile tissue culture fluid recovered mice were challenged intranasally with mhv-jhm mhv-s or sterile tissue culture fluid at 30 days after immunization resistance to challenge inoculation was evaluated in groups of mice at 4 and 30 days after challenge at 4 days the prevalence of mhv lesions in nose and liver was tabulated and mhv titers in liver were determined at 30 days the prevalence of residual brainstem spongiform lesions was tabulated and serum antibody to mhv-jhm and mvh-s was quantified by enzyme immunoassay mice immunized with mhv-jhm or mhv-s resisted challenge with the mhv homotype but mhv-s-immunized mice were fully susceptible to challenge with mvh-jhm mice immunized with enterotropic mhv-y were only partially protected against challenge with antigenically related but biologically different mhv-s serum antibody responses to mhv supported these observations these data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong but highly virus strain-specific
clinical respiratory illness was compared in five homozygous chicken lines originating from homozygous b2 b8 b12 and b19 and heterozygous b2/b12 birds after infection with either of two strains of the infectious bronchitis virus ibv all chickens used in these studies originated from white leghorn and ancona linages ibv gray strain infection of mhc homozygous b12 and b19 haplotype chicks resulted in severe respiratory disease compared to chicks with b2/b2 and b5/b5 haplotypes demonstrating a dominant b2 phenotype b2/b12 birds were also more resistant to ibv respiratory clinical illness in b8/b8 chicks was severe early after infection while illness resolved similar to the b5 and b2 homozygous birds following m41 strain infection birds with b2/b2 and b8/b8 haplotypes were again more resistant to clinical illness than b19/b19 birds real time rt-pcr indicated that infection was cleared more efficiently in trachea lungs and kidneys of b2/b2 and b8/b8 birds compared with b19/b19 birds furthermore m41 infected b2/b2 and b8/b8 chicks performed better in terms of body weight gain than b19/b19 chicks these studies suggest that genetics of b defined haplotypes might be exploited to produce chicks resistant to respiratory pathogens or with more effective immune responses
dengue virus denv is a single-stranded rna virus transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions it causes dengue fever dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome in patients each year 390 million people are estimated to be infected by four serotypes of dengue virus creating a great burden on global public health and local economy so far no antiviral drug is available for dengue disease and the newly licensed vaccine is far from satisfactory one large obstacle for dengue vaccine and drug development is the lack of suitable small animal models although some denv infection models have been developed only a small number of viral strains can infect immunodeficient mice in this study with biologically cloned viruses from a single clinical isolate we have established two mouse models of denv infection one is severe lethal infection in immunocompromised mice and the other resembles self-limited disease manifestations in balb/c mice with transient blockage of type i ifn responses this study not only offers new small animal models of dengue viral infection but also provides new viral variants for further investigations on dengue viral pathogenesis
coronaviruses covs produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species these viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations it is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of covs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences several covs e g severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-cov have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts bovine cov bcov is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen covs that are closely related to bcov have been recognized in dogs humans and in other ruminant species biologic antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like covs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species in this review the different bovine-like covs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants water buffalo sheep goat dromedary camel llama and alpaca and wild ruminants deer wild cattle antelopes giraffes and wild goats are discussed in terms of epidemiology transmission and virus characteristics the presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of bcov in nature spread to new geographical zones and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms animal health research reviews 115
cystoisospora suis is a pathogen that causes diarrhea in pigs and can lead to serious disease species identification especially by histopathological examination is often difficult because of morphologically similar parasites such as eimeria species in this study we used histopathological bacteriological virological and parasitological methods to identify the cause of the disease in two piglets with severe diarrhea villous atrophy diffuse necrosis and flattening of mucosal epithelial cells were found in the ilea of examined piglets and coccidian parasites were found in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells in some merozoites in the meronts the presence of two nuclei indicated type 1 merozoites characteristic of c suis according to cystoisospora-specific pcr targeting the rrna internal transcribed spacer 1 its1 gene the sequences of the products were 98.5% similar to those of c suis escherichia coli o149 serogroup exhibiting a virulence factor profile lt stb and east1 as toxins and f4 as a colonization factor was detected in one piglet no other bacteria or significant enteric viruses were found co-infection with c suis and e coli could imply aggravation of the disease although further study is needed to assess the pathogenicity of this interaction this study is the first to clarify by molecular analysis the sequences of c suis detected in piglets in japan
background salmonellosis in water buffalo bubalus bubalis calves is a widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration occasionally exhibiting a systemic course several salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo but salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized in the present study the prevalence of salmonella spp in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of s typhimurium was performed results the microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of salmonella spp 25% characterized by different serovars most frequently typhimurium 21% muenster 11% and give 11%. the 13 s typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis such as cryptosporidium spp rotavirus or clostridium perfringens other salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions and often 78% of cases isolated with other microorganisms mainly toxinogenic escherichia coli 35% cryptosporidium spp 20% and rotavirus 10%. the s typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction pcr detection of 24 virulence genes the isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles three monophasic s typhimurium b412i- isolates were also found and characterized displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes the molecular characterization was extended to the 7 s muenster and 7 s give isolates collected indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars three representative strains of s typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection the most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfa coding for a thin aggregative fimbria conclusions these results provide evidence that salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves particularly s typhimurium moreover the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected s typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes
high-systemic toxicity and emergence of antifungal-resistant species warrant the development of newer preventive approaches against ic here we have adopted an immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine-based approach to enhance the body's immune response against invasive candida infections using computational tools we screened the entire candida proteome 6030 proteins and identified the most immunodominant hla class i hla class ii and b-cell epitopes by further immunoinformatic analyses for enhanced vaccine efficacy we selected the 18-most promising epitopes which were joined together using molecular linkers to create a multivalent recombinant protein against candida albicans mvpc to increase mvpc's immunogenicity we added a synthetic adjuvant rs09 to the mvpc design the selected mvpc epitopes are homologous against all currently available annotated reference sequences of 22 c albicans strains thus offering a higher coverage and greater protective response a major advantage of the current vaccine approach is mvpc's multivalent nature recognizing multiple-epitopes which is likely to provide enhanced protection against complex candida antigens here we describe the computational analyses leading to mvpc design
after edward jenner established human vaccination over 200 years ago attenuated poxviruses became key players to contain the deadliest virus of its own family variola virus varv the causative agent of smallpox cowpox virus cpxv and horsepox virus hspv were extensively used to this end passaged in cattle and humans until the appearance of vaccinia virus vacv which was used in the final campaigns aimed to eradicate the disease an endeavor that was accomplished by the world health organization who in 1980 ever since naturally evolved strains used for vaccination were introduced into research laboratories where vacv and other poxviruses with improved safety profiles were generated recombinant dna technology along with the dna genome features of this virus family allowed the generation of vaccines against heterologous diseases and the specific insertion and deletion of poxvirus genes generated an even broader spectrum of modified viruses with new properties that increase their immunogenicity and safety profile as vaccine vectors in this review we highlight the evolution of poxvirus vaccines from first generation to the current status pointing out how different vaccines have emerged and approaches that are being followed up in the development of more rational vaccines against a wide range of diseases

crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv is a widely distributed hemorrhagic fever virus and the cause of hemorrhagic disease in africa southern and eastern europe the middle east india and asia recent emergence of cchfv into spain indicates that the geographic range of this virus is expanding and the presence of its tick vector in several countries without reported disease suggest that cchfv will continue to spread research into cchfv was historically limited by a lack of suitable animal models and tools to study viral pathogenesis however in the past few years the toolset for studying cchfv has expanded with small animal and non-human primate models for cchfv being developed along with a reverse genetics system that allows for investigation of viral determinants of disease these tools have been utilized to understand how cchfv antagonizes host restriction factors and to develop novel vaccine candidates that may help limit the substantial morbidity and mortality in humans caused by cchfv
many of the viral pathogens that cause infectious disease in humans have a highly restricted species tropism making the study of their pathogenesis and the development of clinical therapies difficult the improvement of humanized mouse models over the past 30 years has greatly facilitated researchers' abilities to study host responses to viral infections in a cost effective and ethical manner from hiv to hepatotropic viruses to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus humanized mice have led to the identification of factors crucial to the viral life cycle an outlet for testing candidate therapies and improved analysis of human immune responses to infection in tackling both the new and old viruses as they emerge humanized mice will continue to be an indispensable tool 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
severe immunosuppression is a hallmark of morbillivirus infections to study the underlying mechanisms we have developed a ferret model of canine distemper virus infection the model reproduces all clinical signs of measles but the lack of ferret-specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response towards this we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi-quantitative real-time pcr assays to demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non-lethal strains during the prodromal phase we observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response the newly developed cytokine assays strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for morbillivirus pathogenesis studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and sars

since discovering the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov as a causative agent of severe respiratory illness in the middle east in 2012 serological testing has been conducted to assess antibody responses in patients and to investigate the zoonotic reservoir of the virus although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for mers diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories competitive elisa celisa in which a labeled monoclonal antibody mab competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner in this study novel mabs against the spike protein of mers-cov were produced and characterized one of these mabs was used to develop a celisa the celisa detected mers-cov-specific antibodies in sera from mers-cov-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of mers-cov the mab-based celisa was validated using sera from ethiopian dromedary camels relative to the neutralization test the celisa detected mers-cov-specific antibodies in 66 ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100% respectively the celisa and neutralization test results correlated well pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.71-0.76 depending on the celisa serum dilution this celisa may be useful for mers epidemiological investigations on mers-cov infection http//dx
effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses however little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-ncov is available we used the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses including sars-cov which has high sequence similarity to 2019-ncov and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses we identified multiple specific regions in 2019-ncov that have high homology to sars virus parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential b and t cell epitopes for 2019-ncov the independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-ncov we identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-ncov and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates
| seasonal influenza vaccines lack efficacy against drifted or pandemic influenza strains developing improved vaccines that elicit broader immunity remains a public health priority immune responses to current vaccines focus on the haemagglutinin head domain whereas next-generation vaccines target less variable virus structures including the haemagglutinin stem strategies employed to improve vaccine efficacy involve using structure-based design and nanoparticle display to optimize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of target antigens increasing the antigen dose using novel adjuvants stimulating cellular immunity and targeting other viral proteins including neuraminidase matrix protein 2 or nucleoprotein improved understanding of influenza antigen structure and immunobiology is advancing novel vaccine candidates into human trials
background bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses covs including those closely related to human pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome cov there are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in thailand of which two are endemic species due to the zoonotic potential of covs standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative findings a total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in eastern thailand between 2008 and 2013 84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs samples collected either fresh feces or rectal swabs were placed directly into rna stabilization reagent transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at −80°c until further analysis cov rna was detected in 47 specimens 7.6% from 13 different bat species using broadly reactive consensus pcr primers targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene designed to detect all covs thirty seven alphacoronaviruses nine lineage d betacoronaviruses and one lineage b betacoronavirus sars-cov related were identified six new bat cov reservoirs were identified in our study namely cynopterus sphinx taphozous melanopogon hipposideros lekaguli rhinolophus shameli scotophilus heathii and megaderma lyra conclusions covs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations these data suggest that bat cov lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of covs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of thailand further characterization of additional cov genes may be useful to better describe the cov divergence
filoviruses including ebolavirus and marburgvirus pose significant threats to public health and species conservation by causing hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with high mortality rates since the first outbreak in 1967 their origins natural history and ecology remained elusive until recent studies linked them through molecular serological and virological studies to bats we review the ecology epidemiology and natural history of these systems drawing on examples from other bat-borne zoonoses and highlight key areas for future research we compare and contrast results from ecological and virological studies of bats and filoviruses with those of other systems we also highlight how advanced methods such as more recent serological assays can be interlinked with flexible statistical methods and experimental studies to inform the field studies necessary to understand filovirus persistence in wildlife populations and cross-species transmission leading to outbreaks we highlight the need for a more unified global surveillance strategy for filoviruses in wildlife and advocate for more integrated multi-disciplinary approaches to understand dynamics in bat populations to ultimately mitigate or prevent potentially devastating disease outbreaks
the present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic the coronaviridae study group csg of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family coronaviridae has assessed the placement of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-ncov within the coronaviridae based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice the csg recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-significance this will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks
bats are known reservoirs of a wide variety of viruses that rarely result in overt clinical disease in the bat host however anthropogenic influences on the landscape and climate can change species assemblages and interactions as well as undermine host-resilience the cumulative result is a disturbance of bat-pathogen dynamics which facilitate spillover events to sympatric species and may threaten bat communities already facing synergistic stressors through ecological change therefore characterisation of viral pathogens in bat communities provides important basal information to monitor and predict the emergence of diseases relevant to conservation and public health this study used targeted molecular techniques serological assays and next generation sequencing to characterise adenoviruses coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses from 11 species of insectivorous bats within the south west botanical province of western australia phylogenetic analysis indicated complex ecological interactions including virus-host associations cross-species infections and multiple viral strains circulating concurrently within selected bat populations additionally we describe the entire coding sequences for five alphacoronaviruses representing four putative new species and one novel adenovirus results indicate that viral burden both prevalence and richness is not homogeneous among species with chalinolobus gouldii identified as a key epidemiological element within the studied communities

chlamydophila psittaci is found worldwide but is particularly common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions while investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in hong kong we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked mealy parrots which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals the novel adenovirus tentatively named psittacine adenovirus hku1 was most closely related to duck adenovirus a in the atadenovirus genus sequencing showed that the psittacine adenovirus hku1 genome consists of 31735 nucleotides comparative genome analysis showed that the psittacine adenovirus hku1 genome contains 23 open reading frames orfs with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes and six additional orfs at the 39 end of the genome similar to duck adenovirus a the novel adenovirus lacks lh1 lh2 and lh3 which distinguishes it from other viruses in the atadenovirus genus notably fiber-2 protein which is present in aviadenovirus but not atadenovirus is also present in psittacine adenovirus hku1 psittacine adenovirus hku1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3-54.0% for the dna polymerase 64.6-70.7% for the penton protein and 66.1-74.0% for the hexon protein with other atadenovirus the c psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots confirming active viral replication no other viruses were found this is the first documentation of an adenovirus-c psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals the role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals citation to kkw tse h chan w-m choi gky zhang ajx et al 2014 a novel psittacine adenovirus identified during an outbreak of avian chlamydiosis and human psittacosis zoonosis associated with virus-bacterium coinfection in birds plos negl trop dis 812 e3318
background in 2014 a notification of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev was made by the national services of animal health of argentina senasa to the world organization of animal health oie the notification was based on a serological diagnosis in a small farm with a morbidity rate of 2.3% without enteric clinical signs in order to determine if tgev was circulating before the official report a retrospective study on cases of neonatal diarrhea was performed the selection criteria was a sudden increase in mortality in 1-to 21-day-old piglets with watery diarrhea that did not respond to antibiotics based on these criteria three clinical cases were identified during 2010-2015 results all animals that were evaluated presented histological lesions consistent with enteric viral infection the feces and ultrathin sections of intestine that were evaluated by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of round particles of approximately 80 nm in size and characterized by finely granular electrodense nucleoids consistent with complete particles of coronavirus the presence of the tgev antigen was confirmed by monoclonal specific immunohistochemistry and final confirmation of a metabolically-active virus was performed by in situ hybridization to detect a tge mrna encoding spike protein all sections evaluated in this case were negative for pedv and rotavirus a conclusions this is the first case series describing neonatal mortality with etiological confirmation of tgev in argentina the clinical diagnosis of tgev infections in endemic regions is challenging due to the epidemiological distribution and coinfection with other enteric pathogens that mask the clinical presentation
| filoviruses such as ebola virus continue to pose a substantial health risk to humans advances in the sequencing and functional characterization of both pathogen and host genomes have provided a wealth of knowledge to clinicians epidemiologists and public health responders during outbreaks of high-consequence viral disease here we describe how genomics has been historically used to investigate ebola virus disease outbreaks and how new technologies allow for rapid large-scale data generation at the point of care we highlight how genomics extends beyond consensus-level sequencing of the virus to include intra-host viral transcriptomics and the characterization of host responses in acute and persistently infected patients similar genomics techniques can also be applied to the characterization of non-human primate animal models and to known natural reservoirs of filoviruses and metagenomic sequencing can be the key to the discovery of novel filoviruses finally we outline the importance of reverse genetics systems that can swiftly characterize filoviruses as soon as their genome sequences are available
isolated islands provide valuable opportunities to study the persistence of viruses in wildlife populations including population size thresholds such as the critical community size the straw-coloured fruit bat eidolon helvum has been identified as a reservoir for henipaviruses serological evidence and lagos bat virus lbv virus isolation and serological evidence in continental africa here we sampled from a remote population of e helvum annobonensis fruit bats on annobó n island in the gulf of guinea to investigate whether antibodies to these viruses also exist in this isolated subspecies henipavirus serological analyses luminex multiplexed binding and inhibition assays virus neutralisation tests and western blots and lyssavirus serological analyses lbv modified fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation test lbv and mokola virus lentivirus pseudovirus neutralisation assay were undertaken on 73 and 70 samples respectively given the isolation of fruit bats on annobó n and their lack of connectivity with other populations it was expected that the population size on the island would be too small to allow persistence of viruses that are thought to cause acute and immunising infections however the presence of antibodies against henipaviruses was detected using the luminex binding assay and confirmed using alternative assays neutralising antibodies to lbv were detected in one bat using both assays we demonstrate clear evidence for exposure of multiple individuals to henipaviruses in this remote population of e helvum annobonensis fruit bats on annobó n island the situation is less clear for lbv seroprevalences to henipaviruses and lbv in annobó n are notably different to those in e helvum in continental locations studied using the same sampling techniques and assays whilst cross-sectional serological studies in wildlife populations cannot provide details on viral dynamics within populations valuable information on the presence or absence of viruses may be obtained and utilised for informing future studies
| so far most monoclonal antibodies have been developed for treating cancer or immunological diseases however the global spread of infections such as west nile and corona viruses and the need to address the potential threat of bioterrorism has boosted public interest in and government support of countermeasures for infectious diseases the attractive features of monoclonal antibodies such as high specificity and effective recruitment of the immune system would seem to make them excellent candidates as anti-infective agents here we analyse trends in the development and approval of anti-infective monoclonal antibodies and discuss factors that influence their success
previous studies demonstrated that experimental dual infections of pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv followed by h1n1 in¯uenza virus cause more severe disease and growth retardation than the respective single virus infections here three experiments were undertaken to better de®ne the clinical impact of combined prrsv-h1n1 infections in conventional and caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived cdcd pigs groups of pigs were inoculated by aerosol with prrsv followed by h1n1 at 3- 7-or 14-day intervals during the post-h1n1 period mean body temperatures respiratory signs and mean weight gains in the prrsv-h1n1 inoculated groups were recorded and compared with those in uninoculated controls experiments 1 and 2 or in singly virus-inoculated pigs experiment 3 in a ®rst experiment with conventional pigs the prrsv-3d-h1n1 and prrsv-7d-h1n1 infections induced mean body temperatures >40.5°c during 8 days peaks 41.1 and 41.6°c respectively and mean growth reductions of 3.4 and 4.8 kg respectively during the 2 weeks after h1n1 along with marked depression and respiratory disease the prrsv-14d-h1n1 infection on the contrary was largely subclinical in a second experiment with conventional pigs prrsv-3d-h1n1 and prrsv-7d-h1n1 infections were clinically milder with smaller increases in mean body temperatures peak 40.5°c in both groups and growth reductions 1.4 and 1.6 kg respectively in both groups only one pig showed prominent general and respiratory signs in a ®nal experiment with cdcd pigs prrsv-7d-h1n1 infection had minimal effects on mean clinical performances and growth and except for one pig that was severely affected differences with the single virus inoculations were negligible thus both the time interval between infections and the sanitary status of pigs can affect the clinical outcome of dual prrsv-h1n1 infections however factors so far unknown seem to cause large variations in the clinical response between individual pigs u s
26 background the sars-cov-2 virus emerged in december 2019 and caused a 27 pandemic associated with a spectrum of covid-19 disease ranging from 28 asymptomatic to lethal infection serology testing is important for diagnosis of 29 infection determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population it also 30 informs vaccine development although several serology tests are in use improving 31 their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting 32 past infection for population-based studies are priorities 33 methods we evaluated the anti-sars-cov-2 antibody profiles to 15 sars-cov-2 34 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames orfs in mammalian 35 cells and screened antibody responses to them in covid-19 patients using the 36 luciferase immunoprecipitation system lips 37 results the lips technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in covid-19 38 patients to 11 of the 15 sars-cov-2 antigens tested identifying novel immunogenic 39 targets this technique shows that antigens orf3b and orf8 allow detection of 40 antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of 41 the n antigen in covid-19 patients 42 conclusion our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses 43 to a range of sars-cov-2 antigens the combination of 3 sars-cov-2 antibody 44 lips assays i e n orf3b and orf8 is sufficient to identify all covid-19 patients 45 of our cohort even at early time-points of illness whilst spike alone fails to do so 46furthermore our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens 47 nsp1 orf3b orf7a and orf8 which may mediate immune functions other than 48 neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient
influenza virus iv is a continuously evolving virus that widely spreads in humans and contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus h5n1 poses extra challenge to iv control artificial microrna amirna-mediated rna interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect here we designed several amirnas targeting the hemagglutinin gene of h5n1 a major determinant of pathogenicity expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amirna with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 adc68 one amirna ha-1405 significantly limited h5n1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication adc68-conjugated ha-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of h5n1 plaque formation in madin-darby canine kidney cells moreover prophylactic administration with radha-1405 markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3to 40-folds of lung viral rna copies against four clades of h5n1 in institute of cancer research icr mice our results further showed that radha-1405 conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 h5n1 challenge respectively in conclusion these data provided information that ha-targeting amirna delivered by adc68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention

pigs were infected by the oronasal route with european isolates of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv i10 and cobbelsdorf the kinetics of infection in lymphatic organs and the lung were analysed by immunofluorescence detection of virus antigen re-isolation of the virus and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for prrsv-specific rna the kinetics of prrsv infection proceeded in three phases irrespective of the varying infestation of lymphatic organs within the first days post-infection p i first an early acute infection of lymphatic organs developed within the first week and was characterized by a high number of antigen-positive macrophages second a delayed acute infection of the lung was observed which was most pronounced during the second and third week p i when a high number of infected alveolar macrophages was observed the acute infection of lymphatic organs had resolved at this time infected cells in the lung were predominantly located in pneumonic lesions third a persistent infection was demonstrated by rt-pcr and immunohistology when the experiments were terminated at day 49 p i the virus persisted in lymphatic organs especially in the tonsils and in the lung at this stage indications for a re-occurrence of acute infection were observed in restricted areas of the lung
the aim of this study is to determine if enteric viruses are the cause of diarrhea in broiler flocks in jordan intestinal content samples were collected from 101 broiler flocks from several regions of jordan to detect the presence of astrovirus coronavirus reovirus and rotavirus by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr forty-six of these flocks were clinically healthy with no enteric disease and the other 55 flocks were clinically suffering from diarrhea the samples were collected between 5 and 16 d of age the results show that 79% of total 101 flocks tested were infected with one or more of the above enteric viruses coronavirus was the most common virus detected in 56.4% of these flocks with astrovirus in 29.7% of the flocks and rotavirus 9.9% and reovirus 5.6% being the least common none of these flocks were found to be infected with all four viruses but one of the flocks was found to be infected with astrovirus coronavirus and rotavirus simultaneously individual infection was noted with astrovirus coronavirus and rotavirus but not with reovirus whereas all flocks infected with reovirus were also infected with coronavirus there was no statistical evidence to link these viruses as the main cause of diarrhea in the flocks tested this is the first study in jordan to detect all of these viruses and to correlate their presence with diarrhea in chicken flocks
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is a pathogen of great economic significance that impacts the swine industry globally since the first report of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs outbreak tremendous efforts to control this disease including various national policies and plans incorporating the use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines have been made however prrsv is still a significant threat to the swine industry and new variants continually emerge as a result of prrsv evolution several studies have shown that pandemic prrsv strains have enormous genetic diversity and that commercial vaccines can only provide partial protection against these strains therefore effective anti-prrsv drugs may be more suitable and reliable for prrsv control in this study we observed that isobavachalcone ibc which was first isolated from psoralea corylifolia had potent anti-prrsv activity in vitro although many biological activities of ibc have been reported this is the first report describing the antiviral activity of ibc furthermore after a systematic investigation we demonstrated that ibc inhibits prrsv replication at the post-entry stage of prrsv infection thus ibc may be a candidate for further evaluation as a therapeutic agent against prrsv infection of swine in vivo
we report an active surveillance study of the occurrence of specific antibodies to european bat lyssavirus type 1 eblv-1 in bat species scarcely studied hitherto that share the same refuge from 2004 to 2012 406 sera were obtained from nine bat species blood samples were subjected to a modified fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test to determine the antibody titer eblv-1-neutralizing antibodies were detected in six of the nine species analyzed pipistrellus pipistrellus p kuhlii hypsugo savii plecotus austriacus eptesicus serotinus and tadarida teniotis among all bats sampled female seroprevalence 20.21% 95% ci 14.78%-26.57% was not significantly higher than the seroprevalence in males 15.02% 95% ci 10.51%-20.54%. the results showed that the inter-annual variation in the number of seropositive bats in t teniotis and p austriacus showed a peak in 2007 >70% of eblv-1 prevalence however significant differences were observed in the temporal patterns of the seroprevalence modeling of t teniotis and p austriacus the behavioral ecology of these species involved could explain the different annual fluctuations in eblv-1 seroprevalence
as a natural resen'oir of manifold zoonotic viruses fruit bats have been involved in at least three emerging zoonoses in recent years this paper aims to introduce the epidemiological characteristics of these diseases emerged in the australasian region between 1994 and 1999 transmission pathways of the newly discovered viruses and the relationship between the changed entironment of fruit bats and occurrences of these emerging diseases and provide a clue for the epidemiological investigations of sars
neonatal calf diarrhoea triggered by the enteric protozoan parasite cryptosporidium is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in calves aged 1-month-old or younger globally infected cattle in general and calves in particular have also been demonstrated as major contributors of zoonotic c parvum oocysts in the environment and have been linked to a number of waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis little is known on the occurrence geographical distribution and molecular diversity of cryptosporidium infections affecting bovine populations in algeria in this study faecal specimens were randomly collected from 460 cattle aged between two days and 18 months on 10 farms located in the provinces of aïn defla blida sétif and tizi ouzou between the autumn of 2015 and the spring of 2016 faecal samples were microscopically examined using the modified ziehl-neelsen acid-fast technique as screening method microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by a commercial coproantigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bio-x diagnostics the identification of cryptosporidium species and sub-genotypes in confirmed samples was conducted by pcr and sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna and the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 genes of the parasite overall 52.2% 240/460 of the investigated cattle tested positive to cryptosporidium by microscopy the infection was widespread in all 10 farms surveyed but was significantly more prevalent in those from blida in the central part of the country bovine cryptosporidiosis affected cattle of all age groups but with different outcomes pre-weaned up to one month old calves typically presented with diarrhoea whereas older animals mostly harboured subclinical infections the commercial elisa used only detected 15.8% 38/240 of the samples that previously tested positive by microscopy demonstrating a poor performance in field epidemiological surveys sequence analysis of the 29 isolates generated at the ssu rrna loci confirmed the presence of four cryptosporidium species including c parvum 72.4% c bovis 13.8% c andersoni 3.4% and c ryanae 3.4%. two additional isolates 7.0% could only be identified at the genus level eight out of the 21 isolates assigned to c parvum were identified as sub-genotype iiaa16g2r1 at the gp60 locus c parvum was almost exclusively found infecting preweaned calves whereas c ryanae and c andersoni were only detected in asymptomatic animals bovine cryptosporidiosis is highly endemic in the surveyed area and represents a veterinary public health concern that should be adequately tackled by algerian veterinary health authorities and policy makers
drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions poor water quality sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide 3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's mainly through infectious diarrhoea nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries major enteric pathogens in these children include rotavirus campylobacter jejuni enterotoxigenic escherichia coli shigella spp and vibrio cholerae o1 and possibly enteropathogenic e coli aeromonas spp v cholerae o139 enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water but recontamination of treated water is a huge problem emerging environmental pathogens such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei may well be of significance in some regions in adults much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis diabetes reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections so in addition to the traditional pathogens helminths entamoeba histolytica giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e various enteroviruses c jejuni and h pylori are emerging issues in adults
genotype g9 is an emerging genotype among species a rotavirus rva circulating in humans and pigs worldwide in this study an rva strain designated rva/dog-tc/chn/sccd-a/2017/g9p was isolated in cell culture from a pet dog stool sample with acute diarrhea and its whole genome was sequenced the genotype constellation of sccd-a was g9-p-i5-r1-c1-m1-a8-n1-t1-e1-h1 all genome segments except the vp1 gene were closely related to the genes from porcine rva strains or porcine-like human rva strains on the other hand the vp1 gene clustered in a distinct lineage only with that of a g5p porcine-like human rva preventing the identification of the exact host species origin but very unlikely to be originated from human rva in addition phylogenetic analysis showed that the g9 vp7 gene of sccd-a clustered into a novel sublineage within the lineage iii of g9 this first isolation of a g9p rva from a pet dog may justify the exploration of the role dogs play in the interaction of rva circulating in pigs and humans
background although a variety of animals have been used to produce polyclonal antibodies against antigens the production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from animals remains challenging results we propose a simple and rapid strategy to produce monoclonal antibodies from a variety of animals by staining lymph node cells with an antibody against immunoglobulin and a fluorescent dye specific for the endoplasmic reticulum plasma/plasmablast cells were identified without using a series of antibodies against lineage markers by using a fluorescently labeled antigen as a tag for a complementary cell surface immunoglobulin antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells were sorted from the rest of the cell population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting amplification of cognate pairs of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes followed by dna transfection into 293ft cells resulted in the highly efficient production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from a variety of immunized animals conclusions our technology eliminates the need for both cell propagation and screening processes offering a significant advantage over hybridoma and display strategies
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infection in infants immunoprophylaxis with the anti-rsv monoclonal antibody palivizumab reduces the risk for rsv-related hospitalizations but its use is restricted to high-risk infants due to the high costs in this study we investigated if genetic delivery of anti-rsv antibody to neonatal mice by chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 expressing the murine form of palivizumab adc7αrsv can provide protection against rsv intranasal and intramuscular administration of adc7αrsv to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-rsv igg in the serum however only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-rsv igg in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid intranasal administration of adc7αrsv provided protection against subsequent rsv challenge expression of the anti-rsv antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of adc7αrsv to neonatal mice protection against rsv was confirmed at 6 weeks of age these data suggest that neonatal genetic delivery of anti-rsv antibody by adc7αrsv can provide protection against rsv
background for most classes of drugs rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy safety and pharmacokinetic profiles fully human monoclonal antibodies mabs provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases methods in this study we deployed a platform to generate test and develop fully human antibodies to zaire ebolavirus we obtained specific anti-ebola virus ebov antibodies by immunizing velocimmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses results of the antibody clones isolated 3 were selected as best at neutralizing ebov and triggering fcγriiia binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments when combined a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates nhps from ebov disease even after disease symptoms were apparent conclusions this antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions incorporates novel specificities and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal ebov disease in nhps it is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future ebola epidemics
intestinal infection with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec is an important disease in swine resulting in significant economic losses knowledge about the epidemiology the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease the etec causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae f4 k88 f5 k99 f6 987p or f41 while the etec of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae f4 k88 and f18 these fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells enterocytes starting the process of enteric infection after this colonization the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea such as the heat stable toxin a sta the heat stable toxin b stb and the heat labile toxin lt a role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins the diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic e coli coupled with the demonstration by pcr of the genes encoding for virulence factors fimbriae and toxins the diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak among the different methods of control of colibacillosis the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs an accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the etec responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated e coli it is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among e coli isolates growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers
the present study was undertaken to determine immune response and protection efficacy of a spike s protein fragment containing neutralizing epitopes 4f/4r of turkey coronavirus tcov by priming with dna vaccine and boosting with the recombinant protein from the corresponding dna vaccine gene segment turkeys were vaccinated by priming with either one dose g1-750dp or two doses g3-750ddp of 750 g dna vaccine expressing 4f/4r s fragment and boosting with one dose of 200 g 4f/4r s fragment one dose of 100 g dna vaccine mixed with polyethyleneimine pei and sodium hyaluronate ha followed by one dose of 750 g dna vaccine and one dose of 200 g 4f/4r s fragment were given to the turkeys in group g2-100dph after infectious challenge by tcov clinical signs and tcov detected by immunofluorescence antibody ifa assay were observed in less number of turkeys in vaccination groups than that in challenge control groups tcov viral rna loads measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr were lower in vaccinated turkeys than those in challenge control turkeys the turkeys in g3-750ddp produced the highest level of tcov s protein-specific antibody and virus neutralization vn titer comparing to the turkeys in g1-750dp significantly less tcov were detected by ifa in the turkeys in g2-100dph receiving an extra dose of 100 g dna mixed with pei and ha the results indicated that dna-prime protein-boost dna vaccination regimen targeting tcov s fragment encompassing neutralizing epitopes induced humoral immune response and partially protected turkeys against infectious challenge by tcov

calf diarrhea is a commonly reported disease in young animals and still a major cause of productivity and economic loss to cattle producers worldwide in the report of the 2007 national animal health monitoring system for u s dairy half of the deaths among unweaned calves was attributed to diarrhea multiple pathogens are known or postulated to cause or contribute to calf diarrhea development other factors including both the environment and management practices influence disease severity or outcomes the multifactorial nature of calf diarrhea makes this disease hard to control effectively in modern cow-calf operations the purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of a the ecology and pathogenesis of well-known and potential bovine enteric pathogens implicated in calf diarrhea b describe diagnostic tests used to detect various enteric pathogens along with their pros and cons and c propose improved intervention strategies for treating calf diarrhea
the aim of this study was to examine the incidence of clostridioides previously clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens in the feces of diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs also the presence of other common canine enteropathogens was examined toxigenic c difficile and c perfringens positive for the netf-encoding gene netf were detected in 11 11.9% and seven 7.6% diarrheic dogs respectively three dogs were diagnosed simultaneously with toxigenic c difficile and netf-positive c perfringens among other enteropathogens giardia sp was the most common agent detected in dogs positive for toxigenic c difficile or netf-positive c perfringens the results suggest that c difficile and c perfringens occur more frequently as a primary cause of diarrhea
diseases likely affect large carnivore demography and can hinder conservation efforts we considered three highly contagious viruses that infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 canine distemper virus cdv and canine enteric coronaviruses cecov infection by either one of these viruses can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health we investigated infection in the wolf populations of abruzzo lazio e molise national park pnalm italy and of mercantour national park pnm france faecal samples were collected during one winter from october to march from four packs in pnalm n=79 and from four packs in pnm n=66 we screened samples for specific sequences of viral nucleic acids to our knowledge our study is the first documented report of cecov infection in wolves outside alaska and of the large-scale occurrence of cpv-2 in european wolf populations the results suggest that cpv-2 is enzootic in the population of pnalm but not in pnm and that cecov is episodic in both areas we did not detect cdv our findings suggest that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts in particular free-ranging dogs can be important factors influencing infections in wolves this comparative study is an important step in evaluating the nature of possible disease threats in the studied wolf populations recent emergence of new viral strains in europe additionally strengthens the need for proactive monitoring of wolves and other susceptible sympatric species for viral threats and other impairing infections
human papillomavirus hpv infections are particularly problematic for hiv + and solid organ transplant patients with compromised cd4+ t cell-dependent immunity as they produce more severe and progressive disease compared to healthy individuals there are no specific treatments for chronic hpv infection resulting in an urgent unmet need for a modality that is safe and effective for both immunocompromised and otherwise normal patients with recalcitrant disease dna vaccination is attractive because it avoids the risks of administration of live vectors to immunocompromised patients and can induce potent hpv-specific cytotoxic t cell responses we have developed a dna vaccine pngvl4a-hcrte6e7l2 encoding calreticulin crt fused to e6 e7 and l2 proteins of hpv-16 the genotype associated with approximately 90% vaginal vulvar anal penile and oropharyngeal hpv-associated cancers and the majority of cervical cancers administration of the dna vaccine by intramuscular im injection followed by electroporation induced significantly greater hpv-specific immune responses compared to im injection alone or mixed with alum furthermore pngvl4a-hcrte6e7l2 dna vaccination via electroporation of mice carrying an intravaginal hpv-16 e6/e7-expressing syngeneic tumor demonstrated more potent therapeutic effects than im vaccination alone of note administration of the dna vaccine by im injection followed by electroporation elicited potent e6 and e7-specific cd8+ t cell responses and antitumor effects despite cd4+ t cell-depletion although no antibody response was detected while cd4+ t cell-depletion did reduce the e6 and e7-specific cd8+ t cell response it remained sufficient to prevent subcutaneous tumor growth and to eliminate circulating tumor cells in a model of metastatic hpv-16+ cancer thus the antibody response was cd4-dependent whereas cd4+ t cell help enhanced the e6/e7-specific cd8+ t cell immunity but was not required taken together our data suggest that pngvl4a-hcrte6e7l2 dna vaccination via electroporation warrants testing in otherwise healthy patients and those with compromised cd4+ t cell immunity to treat hpv-16-associated anogenital disease and cancer
dengue is the most common arthropodborne infection worldwide affecting at least 50 million people every year and endemic in more than 100 countries the dengue virus is a single-stranded rna virus with four major serotypes infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease the major route of transmission occurs through the aedes aegypti mosquito vector but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection undifferentiated fever dengue fever dengue haemorrhagic fever dhf to dengue shock syndrome dss dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks a trend has also been observed towards 1 these authors contributed equally to this work
background non-severe acute respiratory syndrome non-sars-related human coronaviruses hcovs including hcov-229e -hku1 -nl63 and -oc43 have been detected in respiratory tract samples from children and adults however the natural prevalence of antibodies against these viruses in serum among population is unknown methods to measure antibodies to the spike s protein of the four common non-sars hcovs recombinant s proteins of the four hcovs were expressed and characterised in 293 t cell an s-protein-based indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa was then developed to detect anti-s igg and igm for the four individual hcovs and applied to serum samples from a general asymptomatic population 218 children and 576 adults in beijing results of 794 blood samples tested only 29 3.65% were negative for anti-s igg the seropositivity of the four anti-s igg antibodies was >70% within the general population the majority of seroconversions to four-hcov positivity first occurred in children both s-igg and s-igm antibodies were detectable among children and increased with age reaching a plateau at 6 years of age however no anti-s igm was detected in healthy adults conclusion large proportions of children and adults in beijing have evidence of anti-s igg against four the hcovs and first infections by all four non-sars hcovs takes place during childhood

the objective of the present investigation was to estimate the prevalence of toxoplasma gondii infection and co-infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv classical swine fever virus csfv and porcine circovirus type 2 pcv-2 in pigs in china a total of 372 tissues or serum samples collected from pigs distributed in 9 provinces/ municipalities of china during the period from february 2011 to november 2012 were assayed for t gondii antigens and antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa technique while the pcr was designed for the detection of the prrsv csfv and pcv-2 respectively the total positive rate of t gondii prssv csfv and pcv-2 was 9.14% 34/372 50.00% 186/372 37.10% 138/372 and 3.23% 12/372 respectively among the 34 t gondii positive samples 26 samples were simultaneously infected with t gondii and viruses while the remaining eight samples were infected with t gondii alone in addition the co-infection rate of t gondii with prssv t gondii with prssv and csfv t gondii with prssv and pcv-2 t gondii with csfv and pcv-2 t gondii with prssv csfv and pcv-2 was 1.61% 6/372 4.03% 15/372 0.27% 1/372 0.27% 1/372 and 0.81% 3/372 respectively the results of the present survey revealed that prrsv and csfv were the common pathogens co-existing with porcine toxoplasmosis in china and both of them could increase the chances of t gondii infection in pig this is the first report of t gondii co-infections with viruses in pigs it is very important to understand the interactions of parasite and virus and can be used as reference data for the control and prevention of co-infections of t gondii and viruses in pigs
1 the ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001 pond i 1 ha held water for 98 days whereas pond ii 0.25 ha held water for 34 days populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated 2 in the natural pond water total ciliate abundance in pond ii rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7 in contrast total abundance in pond i began at the same level as in pond ii but increased much more slowly reached a plateau of around 500 individuals l 1 and increased again late in the hydroperiod 3 despite being only 500 m apart the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition pond i contained 50 species compared with 70 species for pond ii with only 24 species shared additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species 88 from pond i 104 from pond ii with 47 species 30% in common pond ii contained more mid-sized ciliates 50-200 lm whereas pond i was dominated by smaller ciliates especially in mid-may and early june in pond i cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures 65 ± 4 species followed by the partialpredator exclusion enclosures 50 ± 4 lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures 39 ± 2 and in the pondwater controls 39 ± 0 differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed lemna outside and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond 4 the physicochemical environment influenced species richness total abundance and the number of rare species 27 in pond ii versus 13 in pond i variation in ciliate abundance in pond i could be explained by the number of days after filling 39% and enclosure treatment 23%. these two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in pond i 46 and 26% respectively sixty-five per cent of the variation in abundance in pond ii could be explained by the measured parameters number of days after filling 27% ph 19% 2 and nitrate levels 12%. fifty-two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters of which ph was the most influential species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed 5 addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds -suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition

large carnivores are of vital importance to the stability and integrity of most ecosystems but recent declines in free-ranging populations have highlighted the potentially devastating effect of infectious diseases on their conservation we reviewed the literature on infectious diseases of 34 large maximum body mass of adults >20 kg terrestrial carnivore species 18 of which are considered to be threatened in the wild and examined reports of antibody prevalence seroprevalence and cases of infection mortality and population decline of 52 diseases examined 44% were viral 31% bacterial and the remainder were protozoal or fungal many infections were endemic in carnivores and/or infected multiple taxonomic families with the majority probably occurring via inhalation or ingestion most disease studies consisted of serological surveys for disease antibodies and antibody detection tended to be widespread implying that exposure to micro-organisms was common seroprevalence was higher in tropical than temperate areas and marginally higher for infections known to occur in multiple carnivore groups confirmation of active infection via micro-organism recovery was less common for ursids than other taxonomic groups published descriptions of disease-induced population decline or extinction were rare and most outbreaks were allegedly the result of direct transmission of rabies or canine distemper virus cdv from abundant carnivore species to less-common large carnivores we conclude that the threat of disease epidemics in large carnivores may be serious if otherwise lethal infections are endemic in reservoir hosts and transmitted horizontally among taxa to prevent or mitigate future population declines research efforts should be aimed at identifying both the diseases of potential importance to large carnivores and the ecological conditions associated with their spread and severity
the continued threat of emerging highly lethal infectious pathogens such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov calls for the development of novel vaccine technology that offers safe and effective prophylactic measures here a novel nanoparticle vaccine is developed to deliver subunit viral antigens and sting agonists in a virus-like fashion sting agonists are first encapsulated into capsid-like hollow polymeric nanoparticles which show multiple favorable attributes including a ph-responsive release profile prominent local immune activation and reduced systemic reactogenicity permissive transgenic mouse model it is shown that mice immunized with this nanoparticle-based mers-cov vaccine are protected against a lethal challenge of mers-cov without triggering undesirable eosinophilic immunopathology together the biocompatible hollow nanoparticle described herein provides an excellent strategy for delivering both subunit vaccine candidates and novel adjuvants enabling accelerated development of effective and safe vaccines against emerging viral pathogens
habitat-mediated global change is driving shifts in species' distributions which can alter the spatial risks associated with emerging zoonotic pathogens many emerging infectious pathogens are transmitted by highly mobile species including bats which can act as spill-over hosts for pathogenic viruses over three years we investigated the seroepidemiology of paramyxoviruses and australian bat lyssavirus in a range-expanding fruit bat the greyheaded flying fox pteropus poliocephalus in a new camp in adelaide south australia over six biannual sampling sessions we quantified median florescent intensity mfi antibody levels for four viruses for a total of 297 individual bats using a multiplex luminex binding assay where appropriate florescence thresholds were determined using finite mixture modelling to classify bats' serological status overall apparent seroprevalence of antibodies directed at hendra cedar and tioman virus antigens was 43.2% 26.6% and 95.7% respectively we used hurdle models to explore correlates of seropositivity and antibody levels when seropositive increased body condition was significantly associated with hendra seropositivity odds ratio = 3.67 p = 0.002 and hendra virus levels were significantly higher in pregnant females p = 0.002 while most bats were seropositive for tioman virus antibody levels for this virus were significantly higher in adults p < 0.001 unexpectedly all sera were negative for australian bat lyssavirus temporal variation in antibody levels suggests that antibodies to hendra virus and tioman virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis these findings suggest a common exposure to hendra virus and other paramyxoviruses in this flying fox camp in south australia
porcine rubulavirus porpv and swine influenza virus infection causes respiratory disease in pigs porpv persistent infection could facilitate the establishment of secondary infections the aim of this study was to analyse the pathogenicity of classic swine h1n1 influenza virus swh1n1 in growing pigs persistently infected with porcine rubulavirus conventional six-week-old pigs were intranasally inoculated with porpv swh1n1 or porpv/swh1n1 a mock-infected group was included the co-infection with swh1n1 was at 44 days post-infection dpi right after clinical signs of porpv infection had stopped the pigs of the co-infection group presented an increase of clinical signs compared to the simple infection groups in all infected groups the most recurrent lung lesion was hyperplasia of the bronchiolarassociated lymphoid tissue and interstitial pneumonia by means of immunohistochemical evaluation it was possible to demonstrate the presence of the two viral agents infecting simultaneously the bronchiolar epithelium viral excretion of porpv in nasal and oral fluid was recorded at 28 and 52 dpi respectively porpv persisted in several samples from respiratory tissues rt secondary lymphoid organs slo and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf for swh1n1 the viral excretion in nasal fluids was significantly higher in single-infected swh1n1 pigs than in the co-infected group however the coinfection group exhibited an increase in the presence of swh1n1 in rt slo and balf at two days after coinfection in conclusion the results obtained confirm an increase in the clinical signs of infection and porpv was observed to impact the spread of swh1n1 in analysed tissues in the early stage of co-infection although viral shedding was not enhanced in the present study the interaction of swh1n1 infection is demonstrated in pigs persistently infected with porpv
a high diversity of corona-and paramyxoviruses have been detected in different bat species at study sites worldwide including africa however no biosurveillance studies from rwanda have been reported in this study samples from bats collected from caves in ruhengeri rwanda were tested for the presence of corona-and paramyxoviral rna using reverse transcription pcr assays positive results were further characterized by dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis in addition to morphological identification of bat species we also did molecular confirmation of species identities contributing to the known genetic database available for african bat species we detected a novel betacoronavirus in two geoffroy's horseshoe bats rhinolophus clivosus bats we also detected several different paramyxoviral species from various insectivorous bats one of these viral species was found to be homologous to the genomes of viruses belonging to the jeilongvirus genus additionally a henipavirus-related sequence was detected in an egyptian rousette fruit bat rousettus aegyptiacus these results expand on the known diversity of corona-and paramyxoviruses and their geographical distribution in africa
the major histocompatibility complex mhc is one of the most diverse genetic regions under pathogen-driven selection because of its central role in antigen binding and immunity the highest mhc variability both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies has so far been found in passerine birds this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats if extraordinary high mhc variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species then similarly diverse mhc architectures should be found in bats bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens conspecifics and allospecifics we have characterized the mhc class i diversity in 116 panamanian seba's short-tailed bats carollia perspicillata a widely distributed generalist neotropical species we have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of mhc class i genes with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual this diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and in both taxonomic groups further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms our findings support the hypothesis that for species with a geographically broader range high mhc class i variability is particularly adaptive investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high mhc diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses

severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by a newly identified coronavirus sars-cov remains a threat to cause epidemics as evidenced by recent sporadic cases in china in this communication we evaluated the efficacy and safety of two sars vaccine candidates based on the recombinant modified vaccinia ankara mva expressing sars-cov spike or nucleocapsid proteins in ferrets no clinical signs were observed in all the ferrets challenged with sars-cov on the other hand vaccination did not prevent sars-cov infection in ferrets in contrast immunized ferrets particularly those immunized with rmva-spike exhibited significantly stronger inflammatory responses and focal necrosis in liver tissue after sars-cov challenge than control animals thus our data suggest that enhanced hepatitis is linked to vaccination with rmva expressing sars-cov antigens crown
in the anthropocene context changes in climate land use and biodiversity are considered among the most important anthropogenic factors affecting parasites-host interaction and wildlife zoonotic diseases emergence transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector usually a macroparasite and its reservoir host in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate the scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens specifically we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in europe tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev and west nile virus wnv in both cases variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a one-health framework
europe cv777 virulence historical review a b s t r a c t a retrospect is given on the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped during the early seventies in europe while at first it appeared as a disease affecting feeder pigs fattening-and adult swine it later also became pathogenic for neonatal and suckling pigs hereby drastically increasing its economic impact isolation of the causative virus revealed a new porcine coronavirus the origin of which has never been clarified pathogenesis studies with the prototype strain cv777 showed severe villous atrophy in neonatal pigs and the virus-animal interactions showed many similarities with transmissible gastro-enteritis virus tgev another porcine coronavirus disease patterns in field outbreaks showed muchvariation but while farm related factors played a role possible genetic variations of virus strains in europe have not been examined and are thus unknown cv777 in experimental pigs caused diarrheal disease and mortality rates similar to those later encountered in asia and more recently with the "original" us strains even though genomic typing of the prototype european strain have shown that it belongs to the s-indel strains in europe ped has become endemic during the eighties and nineties and subsequently regressed so that after 2000 swine populations in many countries have largely become seronegative sporadic outbreaks have recently reappeared showing a large variety of clinical outcomes
background the development of the innate and adaptive immune responses to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv after vaccination of 1 day-old pigs with a prrsv-1 based modified live virus mlv vaccine by intramuscular im and intranasal in routes was characterised before and after challenge with a heterologous prrsv-1 isolate at 18 weeks post-vaccination twenty-five prrsv-seronegative piglets were used at 1 day of age pigs were administered with a single dose of vaccine via the im n = 10 or the in route n = 10 control group n = 5 received saline solution after vaccination pigs were bled at days 3 7 28 56 83 113 and 125 levels of cytokines il-10 il-8 ifn-α measured by elisa tests of serum tnf-α and ifn-γ measured by elisa and elispot respectively from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum neutralising antibodies na to the vaccine strain were measured the induction of il-10 was rare indicating that il-10 mediated immunomodulation/immune dysfunction was not a feature of this vaccine or of the challenge virus il-8 was detected in only two pigs following vaccination but in the majority of pigs after challenge indicating that their ability to produce an innate immune response was not impaired tnf-α was not detected in any vaccinated pigs until day 83 after challenge only a minority of pigs produced tnf-α ifn-α was detected in all vaccinated pigs following vaccination indicating the potential for development of an effective th1 adaptive immune response ifn-γ-secreting cells were detected in all vaccinated pigs after vaccination na to the vaccine strain were first detected at day 56 in pigs vaccinated by both routes and remained at similar levels until challenge after challenge a boost in na was observed the efficacy of the vaccine was demonstrated by reduction of viraemia and nasal shedding after challenge the administration of a prrsv-1 based mlv vaccine to 1 day-old piglets was able to induce an immune response characterised by 1 undetectable or low levels of il-10 il-8 and tnf-α 2 an increase in ifn-α expression within the first seven days 3 a gradual increase in the number of antigen-specific ifn-γ-secreting cells and 4 induction of detectable na after challenge with a heterologous strain there was a rapid boost in na titres indicating a priming effect of the vaccine
although previous studies have reported that the gut microbiota is changed in calves during diarrhea less is known about whether rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota here we characterized fecal microbial communities and identified possible relationships between the gut microbiota profiles and physiological parameters five fecal specimens of rotavirus-infected calves from 1 to 30 days after birth and five fecal specimens of age-matched healthy calves were used for the microbial community analysis using the illumina miseq sequencer rotavirus infection was associated with reduced rotavirus infection significantly reduced the richness and diversity of the bacterial community weighted unique fraction metric analysis exhibited significant differences in community membership and structure between healthy and rotavirus-infected calves based on relative abundance analysis and linear discriminant analysis effect size we found that the representative genera from lactobacillus subdoligranulum blautia and bacteroides were closely related to healthy calves while the genera escherichia and clostridium were closely affiliated to rotavirus-infected calves furthermore canonical correlation analysis and pearson correlation coefficient results revealed that the increased relative abundances of lactobacillus subdoligranulum and bacteroides were correlated with normal levels of physiological characteristics such as white blood cells blood urea nitrogen serum amyloid protein a and glucose concentration in serum these results suggest that rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota correlating changes in physiological parameters this study provides new information on the relationship between gut microbiota and the physiological parameters of rotavirus-mediated diarrheic calves
aim this study aimed to study the prevalence of the coinfection of enteric bacterial and viral pathogens namely escherichia coli salmonella rotavirus and picobirnavirus from fecal samples of pre-weaned piglets in northeast region of india a total of 457 fresh fecal samples were collected from piglets under 9 weeks old during 2013-2015 from organized n=225 and unorganized n=232 farms of manipur meghalaya mizoram and nagaland samples were collected from diarrheic n =339 and non-diarrheic n=118 piglets including local indigenous n=130 and crossbreed n=327 piglets in different seasons during the study period the samples were processed for the isolation of e coli and salmonella and detection of their putative virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction pcr samples were also processed for the detection of rotavirus and picobirnavirus by rna-polyacrylamide agarose gel electrophoresis and reverse transcriptase-pcr rt-pcr results a total of 11 2.40% samples were found positive for two or more coinfecting enteric bacterial and viral pathogens all the 11 positive fecal samples were recovered from diarrheic piglets salmonella typhimurium enterotoxin stn gene and picobirnavirus genogroup 1 were found to be more frequent as coinfecting agents coinfection was recorded higher in unorganized 3.87% compared to organized farm 0.88%. again higher detection was recorded in crossbreed 2.75% than local indigenous piglets 1.53%. the occurrence of coinfection was found to be more common during summer 4.68% followed by winter 2.27% season the present study highlighted the significance of e coli salmonella rotavirus and picobirnavirus as important diarrheagenic pathogens causing coinfection in piglets in northeast region of india probably this is the first systematic study of the coinfection of four important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral agents associated with piglet diarrhea in india
foot-and-mouth disease fmd is a highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals which has significant economic consequences in affected countries as the currently available vaccines against fmd provide no protection until 4-7 days post-vaccination the only alternative method to control the spread of fmd virus fmdv during outbreaks is the application of antiviral agents hence it is important to identify effective antiviral agents against fmdv infection in this study we found that mizoribine has potent antiviral activity against fmdv replication in ibrs-2 cells a time-of-drug-addition assay demonstrated that mizoribine functions at the early stage of replication moreover mizoribine also showed antiviral effect on fmdv in vivo in summary these results revealed that mizoribine could be a potential antiviral drug against fmdv
analyses of turkey coronavirus tcov an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus ibv an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens were conducted to determine the adaptive potential and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus strains of tcov that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in ibv with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift following emergence in turkeys tcov diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike this is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses
recombination occurs in many rna viruses and can be of major evolutionary significance however rates of recombination vary dramatically among rna viruses which can range from clonal to highly recombinogenic here we review the factors that might explain this variation in recombination frequency and show that there is little evidence that recombination is favoured by natural selection to create advantageous genotypes or purge deleterious mutations as predicted if recombination functions as a form of sexual reproduction rather recombination rates seemingly reflect larger-scale patterns of viral genome organization such that recombination may be a mechanistic by-product of the evolutionary pressures acting on other aspects of virus biology populations of rna viruses habitually harbour abundant genetic variability which is in large part due to a combination of high mutation rates and large population sizes 1 . although rna viruses were initially thought to experience only limited recombination both experimental studies and analyses of the rapidly growing database of viral gene sequences have revealed not only that recombination occurs in many families of rna viruses but also that it can sometimes have a major impact on their evolution emergence and epidemiology indeed recombination has been associated with the expansion of viral host range 23 increases in virulence 4 the evasion of host immunity 5 and the evolution of resistance to antivirals 6 . however despite the growing evidence for the action of recombination in rna viruses the evolutionary reasons for its occurrence remain uncertain the process of recombination that takes place in rna viruses corresponds to the formation of chimeric molecules from parental genomes of mixed origin this process can occur either within a single genomic segment in which case it is often referred to as rna recombination or for those viruses that possess segmented genomes as exchange of entire genomic segments between viruses fig 1 . this exchange is usually termed reassortment although rna recombination and reassortment are mechanistically very different both require that two or more viruses infect the same host cell in this review we describe the different mechanisms of recombination in rna viruses and the evolutionary forces that shape the diversity of recombination rates
a novel avian influenza subtype a/h7n9 emerged in 2013 and represents a public health threat with pandemic potential we have previously shown that dna vaccine priming increases the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to h5n1 monovalent inactivated boost we now report the safety and immunogenicity of a h7 dna-h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine prime-boost regimen in this phase 1 open label randomized clinical trial we evaluated three h7n9 vaccination regimens in healthy adults with a prime-boost interval of 16 weeks group 1 received h7 dna vaccine prime and h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine boost group 2 received h7 dna and h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a prime and h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a boost group 3 received h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine in a homologous prime-boost regimen overall 30 individuals between 20 to 60 years old enrolled and 28 completed both vaccinations all injections were well tolerated with no serious adverse events 2 weeks post-boost 50% of group 1 and 33% of group 2 achieved a hai titer ≥140 compared with 11% of group 3 also at least a fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody responses was seen in 90% of group 1 100% of group 2 and 78% of group 3 subjects peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers were significantly greater for group 1 gmt = 440.61 p < 0.05 and group 2 gmt = 331 p = 0.02 when compared with group 3 gmt = 86.11 a novel h7 dna vaccine was safe well-tolerated and immunogenic when boosted with h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine while priming for higher hai and neutralizing antibody titers than h7n9 monovalent inactivated vaccine alone npj vaccines 2017 215
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a diarrheal disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv it is characterized by acute watery diarrhea dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets the spike protein of pedv plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the s1 subunit which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis in this study we successfully constructed an immune phage display single-domain antibody library with a library size of 3.4 × 10 6 . a single-domain antibody named s7 specific for the spike protein of pedv was identified from the phage display single-domain antibody library s7 could be expressed in a soluble form in e coli bound to the spike protein of pedv in elisa and stained the pedv virus in vero cells but it showed no neutralization activity on pedv these results indicated the potent application of the s7 antibody as an imaging probe or as a candidate for the development of a diagnostic assay
the recent 2014-2016 west african ebola virus epidemic underscores the need for the development of novel anti-ebola therapeutics due to the high mortality rates of ebola virus infections and the lack of fda-approved vaccine or therapy that is available for the prevention and treatment traditional chinese medicines tcms represent a huge reservoir of bioactive chemicals and many tcms have been shown to have antiviral activities 373 extracts from 128 tcms were evaluated using a high throughput assay to screen for inhibitors of ebola virus cell entry extract of rhodiola rosea displayed specific and potent inhibition against cell entry of both ebola virus and marburg virus in addition twenty commercial compounds that were isolated from rhodiola rosea were evaluated using the pseudotyped ebola virus entry assay and it was found that ellagic acid and gallic acid which are two structurally related compounds are the most effective ones the activity of the extract and the two pure compounds were validated using infectious ebola virus the time-of-addition experiments suggest that mechanistically the rhodiola rosea extract and the effective compounds act at an early step in the infection cycle following initial cell attachment but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion our findings provide evidence that rhodiola rosea has potent anti-filovirus properties that may be developed as a novel anti-ebola treatment
feline coronaviruses fcov comprise two biotypes feline enteric coronaviruses fecv and feline infectious peritonitis viruses fipv fecv is associated with asymptomatic persistent enteric infections while fipv causes feline infectious peritonitis fip a usually fatal systemic disease in domestic cats and some wild felidae fipv arises from fecv by mutation fcov also occur in two serotypes i and ii of which the serotype i viruses are by far the most prevalent in the field yet most of our knowledge about fcov infections relates to serotype ii viruses particularly about the fipv mainly because type i viruses grow poorly in cell culture hence the aim of the present work was the detailed study of the epidemiologically most relevant viruses the avirulent serotype i viruses kittens were inoculated oronasally with different doses of two independent fecv field strains ucd and rm persistent infection could be reproducibly established the patterns of clinical symptoms faecal virus shedding and seroconversion were monitored for up to 10 weeks revealing subtle but reproducible differences between the two viruses faecal virus i e genomic rna was detected during persistent fecv infection only in the large intestine downstream of the appendix and could occasionally be observed also in the blood the implications of our results particularly our insights into the persistently infected state are discussed coronavirus / experimental infection / fecv / persistence / cat
the development of strategies to augment the immunogenicity of dna vaccines is critical for improving their clinical utility one such strategy involves using the different immune routes with dna vaccines in the present study the immunogenicity of sars-cov nucleocapsid dna vaccine induced by using the current routine vaccination routes intramuscularly by electroporation or orally using live-attenuated salmonella typhimurium was compared in mouse model the comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate t cell response and antibody response mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response in contrast the orally dna vaccine evoked vigorous t cell response and a weak antibody production these results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of dna immunization in addition our results also show that the delivery of dna vaccines by electroporation and orally using live-attenuated salmonella in vivo is an effective method to increase the immune responses further studies could be carried out using a combination strategy of both oral and electroporation immunizations to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses
ebola virus ebov is the most virulent pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with high 27 mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates the postexposure antibody therapies to 28 prevent ebov infection are considered efficient however due to the poor thermal stability of 29 mammalian antibody their application in the tropics has been limited here we developed a 30 thermostable therapeutic antibody against ebov based on chicken immunoglobulin y igy the igy antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability which retained their neutralizing 32 activity at 25°c for one year in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies 33 mabs we immunized laying hens with a variety of ebov vaccine candidates and confirmed 34 that vsvδg/ebovgp encoding the ebov glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing 35 antibodies against ebov the therapeutic efficacy of immune igy antibodies in vivo was 36 evaluated in the newborn balb/c mice model lethal dose of virus challenged mice were treated 37 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-ebov igy
background human monoclonal antibodies mabs generated as a result of the immune response are likely to be the most effective therapeutic antibodies particularly in the case of infectious diseases against which the immune response is protective human cytomegalovirus hcmv is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients the available therapeutic armamentarium e g hcmv hyperimmune globulins or antivirals is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains therefore neutralizing human mab may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated hcmv infections in these patients the purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mab against hcmv from the immunological repertoire of immune donors to this aim we designed an efficient technology relying on two discrete and sequential steps first human b-lymphocytes are stimulated with tlr9-agonists and il-2 second after both additives are removed the cells are infected with ebv using this strategy we obtained 29 clones secreting igg neutralizing the hcmv infectivity four among these were further characterized all of the mabs neutralize the infection in different combinations of hcmv strains and target cells with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the hcmv hyperimmune globulins currently used in transplant recipients recombinant human monoclonal igg1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated the technology described has proven to be more reproducible efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mabs for immunotherapeutic uses
the canine infectious respiratory disease complex cirdc is an endemic worldwide syndrome involving multiple viral and bacterial pathogens traditionally bordetella bronchiseptica bb canine adenovirus type 2 cav-2 canine distemper virus cdv canine herpesvirus chv and canine parainfluenza virus cpiv were considered the major causative agents lately new pathogens have been implicated in the development of cirdc namely canine influenza virus civ canine respiratory coronavirus crcov canine pneumovirus cnpnv mycoplasma cynos and streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus to better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of cirdc and their epidemiological relevance in europe prevalence data were collected from peerreviewed publications and summarized evidence of exposure to bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs co-infections with viral pathogens are common the findings confirm that bb is an important cause of cirdc in europe cav-2 and cdv recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination seroconversion to chv can be demonstrated following cirdc outbreaks and chv has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs there is some evidence that chv is not a primary cause of cirdc but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease the currently available data suggest that civ is at present neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in europe cpiv remains an important pathogen in cirdc and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens cnpnv and crcov are important new elements in the aetiology of cirdc and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments m cynos is common in europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs this organism is frequently found together with other cirdc pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs s zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination however even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages they reduce spread increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of cirdc will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog
the discovery and characterization of novel arthropod-borne viruses provide valuable information on their genetic diversity ecology evolution and potential to threaten animal or public health arbovirus surveillance is not conducted regularly in romania being particularly very scarce in the remote and diverse areas like the danube delta here we describe the detection and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus reoviridae orbivirus designated as letea virus which was found in grass snakes natrix natrix during a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic survey conducted between 2014 and 2017 this virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles phylogenetic analyses placed letea virus as a highly divergent species in the culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine letea virus strains obtained implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus however the screening of arthropods including culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program tested negative for letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus the study provided complete genome sequences for nine letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity host range ecology and evolution the phylogenetic associations warrant further screening of arthropods as well as sustained surveillance efforts for elucidation of letea virus natural cycle and possible implications for animal and human health
argentine haemorrhagic fever ahf is a rodent-borne disease with a lethality as high as~30% which is caused by the new world arenavirus junín virus junv it was once a major epidemic in south america and puts millions of people in argentina at risk here we aimed to develop horse antibodies or antibody fragments against junv before preparing the horse antibodies a strategy to efficiently generate horse antisera was established based on comparisons among immunogens and immunization methods in both mice and horses antisera against junv were finally obtained by vaccinating horses with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing junv gp the horse antibodies igg and fab' 2 were subsequently demonstrated to effectively neutralize vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing junv gp and to show some cross-neutralization against pathogenic new world arenaviruses further research revealed that asp123 on gp1 is an important site for the binding of antibodies targeting mainly junv gp1 for neutralization collectively this study presents an efficient strategy to develop horse antisera against junv and provides gp1-specific horse antibodies as potential therapeutics for ahf
dogs and cats are commonly exposed to infectious disease agents the following article is an update on the most common infectious disease assays used in small animal practice in some situations results of pathogenspecific molecular diagnostic assays can be used to assist the practicing veterinarian in the management of patients with infectious diseases however with some infectious disease agents the assays are positive in healthy and ill animals and can be falsely negative and so the predictive values of the assays vary
emerging zoonotic diseases have received tremendous interests in recent years as they pose a significant threat to human health animal welfare and economic stability a high proportion of zoonoses originate from wildlife reservoirs rodents are the most numerous widespread and diverse group of mammals on the earth and are reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses responsible for significant morbidity and mortality a better understanding of virome diversity in rodents would be of importance for researchers and professionals in the field therefore we developed the drodvir database http//www mgc ac cn/ drodvir/ a comprehensive up-to-date and well-curated repository of rodent-associated animal viruses the database currently covers 7690 sequences from 5491 rodent-associated mammal viruses of 26 viral families detected from 194 rodent species in 93 countries worldwide in addition to virus sequences the database provides detailed information on related samples and host rodents as well as a set of online analytical tools for text query blast search and phylogenetic reconstruction the drodvir database will help virologists better understand the virome diversity of rodents moreover it will be a valuable tool for epidemiologists and zoologists for easy monitoring and tracking of the current and future zoonotic diseases as a data application example we further compared the current status of rodent-associated viruses with bat-associated viruses to highlight the necessity for including additional host species and geographic regions in future investigations which will help us achieve a better understanding of the virome diversities in the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases
background within the genera chlamydia the development of refined diagnostic techniques has allowed the identification of four species that are capable of infecting pigs the epidemiology clinical and zoonotic impacts of these species are however largely unknown the study aimed to investigate the presence of chlamydia spp in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs and relate the findings to clinical signs results by histology 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection by pcr forty-six of the pigs were positive whereas two samples were inhibited sequencing of 19 dna extracts identified these as chlamydia suis by immunohistochemistry 32 of 44 samples were positive and a significant relationship was detected between macroscopically visible intestinal lesions and a high degree of infection by real-time pcr a significant difference was detected between pigs with and without conjunctivitis when a ct value of 36 was employed but not when a ct value of 38 was employed conclusions chlamydia suis was demonstrated in most samples and overall no correlation to clinical signs was detected however a correlation was noted between samples with a high degree of infection and the presence of clinical signs it is possible that the intensive pig production systems studied might predispose for the transmission and maintenance of the infection thus increasing the infectious load and the risk for disease in the pig
background toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite infecting almost all warm-blooded animals including birds with a worldwide distribution surveys of t gondii infection in wild birds have been reported extensively in the world but little is known of t gondii infection in peafowls worldwide this study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of t gondii infection in peafowls in yunnan province southwestern china methods sera from 277 peafowls including 272 blue peafowls pavo cristatus and 5 green peafowls pavo muticus originated from two geographic areas in yunnan province were assayed for t gondii antibodies using the modified agglutination test mat results specific t gondii antibodies were detected in 35 of 277 12.64% peafowls mat titer ≥ 15 seropositive birds were found in both species 33 in 272 blue peafowls and 2 in 5 green peafowls there was no significant difference in t gondii seroprevalence between the adolescent birds 6.74% and the adult birds 6.67% p > 0.05 the geographical origins of peafowls was found to be highly associated with t gondii infection in the present study a statistically significant difference in t gondii seropositivity was observed between peafowls from kunming 31.08% and those from xishuangbanna dai autonomous prefecture 5.91% or = 10.956 95% ci = 1.632-73.545 p = 0.014 statistical analyses showed that there were no significant interactions between ages and geographical origins of peafowls p > 0.05 the results of the present survey indicated that infection of peafowls with t gondii is widespread in yunnan province which has significant public health concerns and implications for prevention and control of toxoplamosis in this province to our knowledge this is the first seroprevalence report of t gondii infection in china's southwestern yunnan province
the host-associated defence system responsible for the clearance of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv from infected pigs is currently poorly understood to better understand the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions seventy-five of 100 pigs infected with prrsv-ja142 and 25 control pigs were euthanized at 3 10 21 28 and 35 days post-challenge dpc blood lung bronchoalveolar lavage bal and bronchial lymph node bln samples were collected to evaluate the cellular immune responses the humoral responses were evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-prrsv igg and serum virus-neutralizing svn antibodies consequently the highest viral loads in the sera and lungs of the infected pigs were detected between 3 and 10 dpc and these resulted in moderate to mild interstitial pneumonia which resolved accompanied by the clearance of most of the virus by 28 dpc at peak viremia the frequencies of alveolar macrophages in infected pigs were significantly decreased whereas the monocytederived dc/macrophage and conventional dc frequencies were increased and these effects coincided with the early induction of local t-cell responses and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lungs bal and bln as early as 10 dpc conversely the systemic t-cell responses measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were delayed and significantly induced only after the peak viremic stage between 3 and 10 dpc taken together our results suggest that activation of immune responses in the lung could be the key elements for restraining prrsv through the early induction of t-cell responses at the sites of virus replication.© the authors 2020 this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 4.0 international license which permits use sharing adaptation distribution and reproduction in any medium or format as long as you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons licence and indicate if changes were made the images or other third party material in this article are included in the article' s creative commons licence unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material if material is not included in the article'
lyme borreliosis is a bacterial infection that can be spread to humans by infected ticks and may severely affect many organs and tissues nearly four decades have elapsed since the discovery of the disease agent called borrelia burgdorferi although there is a plethora of knowledge on the infectious agent and thousands of scientific publications an effective way on how to combat and prevent lyme borreliosis has not been found yet there is no vaccine for humans available and only one active vaccine program in clinical development is currently running a spirited search for possible disease interventions is of high public interest as surveillance data indicates that the number of cases of lyme borreliosis is steadily increasing in europe and north america this review provides a condensed digest of the history of vaccine development up to new promising vaccine candidates and strategies that are targeted against lyme borreliosis including elements of the tick vector the reservoir hosts and the borrelia pathogen itself
background production of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibit broadly neutralizing activity is needed for preventing hiv-1 infection however only a few such antibodies have been generated till date isolation of antibodies by the hybridoma technology is a cumbersome process with fewer yields further the loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have unique binding specificities often occurs during cloning and propagation and the strongly positive clones are often lost this has been avoided by the process described in this paper wherein by combining the strategy of ebv transformation and recombinant dna technology we constructed human single chain variable fragments scfvs against the third variable region v3 of the clade c hiv-1 envelope results an antigen specific phage library of 7000 clones was constructed from the enriched v3-positive antibody secreting ebv transformed cells by ligation of the digested scfv dna into phagemid vector and bio panning against the hiv-1 consensus c and b v3 peptides followed by random selection of 40 clones we identified 15 clones that showed v3 reactivity in phage elisa dna fingerprinting analysis and sequencing showed that 13 out of the 15 clones were distinct expression of the positive clones was tested by sds-page and western blot all the 13 anti-v3 scfvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade c and b v3 peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in elisa preliminary neutralization assays indicated varying degrees of neutralization of clade c and b viruses ebv transformation followed by antigen selection of lines to identify specific binders enabled the selection of phage from un-cloned lines for scfv generation thus avoiding the problems of hybridoma technology moreover as the clones were pretested for antigen binding a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage after selection the phage clones were propagated in a clonal manner conclusions this strategy can be efficiently used and is cost effective for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies this is the first study to generate anti-v3 scfvs against hiv-1 clade c
mammalian orthoreoviruses mrvs which cause gastrointestinal and respiratory illness have been isolated from a wide variety of mammalian species including bats minks pigs and humans here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel mrv type 3 mrv3 named mrv-zj2013 from the diarrheic feces of piglets in zhejiang province china genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that mrv-zj2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink bat and pig mrvs suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds neonatal piglets infected with mrv-zj2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets each for one-or two-day post-infection in contrast piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea these findings suggest that the virulence of mrv-zj2013 if any was likely not significant compared to that of pedv a seroepidemiological survey of mrv by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay elisa based on a recombinant mrv3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence 77% in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east china between 2015 and 2016 indicating that mrv3 is endemic in pig herds in china and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens
the ovalbumin 257-264 ctl epitope on the major coat protein of the filamentous bacteriophage in different antigen formulations was displayed and the immune response in c57bl6/j mice studied the display of single cytotoxic epitope on the surface of the virion is sufficient to induce priming and sustain long-term major histocompatibility complex class i restricted cytotoxic t lymphocytes response in vivo the filamentous bacteriophage is a versatile carrier able to display simultaneously either single or multiple epitopes and can elicit a cellular response carrying very little peptide o1.5 mg
bats may be natural reservoirs for a large variety of emerging viruses including mammalian coronaviruses cov the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in humans with evidence that these viruses may have their ancestry in bats highlights the importance of virus surveillance in bat populations here we report the identification and molecular characterization of a bat β-coronavirus detected during a viral survey carried out on different bat species in the island of sardinia italy cutaneous oral swabs and faecal samples were collected from 46 bats belonging to 15 different species and tested for viral presence coronavirus rna was detected in faecal samples from three different species the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum the brown long-eared bat plecotus auritus and the european free-tailed bat tadarida teniotis phylogenetic analyses based on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp sequences assigned the detected cov to clade 2b within betacoronaviruses clustering with sars-like bat covs previously reported these findings point to the need for continued surveillance of bat cov circulating in sardinian bats and extend the current knowledge on cov ecology with novel sequences detected in bat species not previously described as β-coronavirus hosts
tylosema esculentum marama beans and tubers are used as food and traditional medicine against diarrhoea in southern africa rotaviruses rvs are a major cause of diarrhoea among infants young children immunocompromised people and domesticated animals our work is first to determine anti-rv activity of marama bean and tuber ethanol and water extracts in this case on intestinal enterocyte cells of human infant h4 adult pig clab and adult bovine cieb origin marama cotyledon ethanolic extract mce and cotyledon water extract mcw without rv were not cytotoxic to all cells tested while seed coat and tuber extracts showed variable levels of cytotoxicity marama cotyledon ethanolic and water extracts mce and mcw resp ≥0.1 mg/ml seed coat extract msce and seed coat water extract mscw 0.01 to 0.001 mg/ml especially ethanolic significantly increased cell survival and enhanced survival to cytopathic effects of rv by at least 100% after in vitro co-and preincubation treatments all marama extracts used significantly enhanced nitric oxide release from h4 cells and enhanced ter ω/cm 2 of enterocyte barriers after coincubation with rv marama cotyledon and seed coat extracts inhibited virion infectivity possibly through interference with replication due to accumulation of nitric oxide marama extracts are therefore promising microbicides against rv
prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections in this study we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody kz52 to protect against ebola virus in rhesus macaques this antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody kz52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1000 plaque-forming units of ebola virus followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge a control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection we show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape it appears that ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody
canine coronavirus ccov is responsible for mild or moderate enteritis in puppies the virus is highly contagious and avoiding contact with infected dogs and their excretions is the only way to ensure disease prevention since no studies have yet focused on the sensitivity of ccov to chemical biocides the present investigation examined the efficiency of physical and chemical methods of viral inactivation ccov infectivity was stable at +56°c for up to 30 min but tended to decrease rapidly at +65°c and +75°c germicidal ultra-violet uv-c light exposure demonstrated no significant effects on virus inactivation for up to 3 days ccov was observed to be more stable at ph 6.0-6.5 while extreme acidic conditions inactivated the virus two tested aldehydes inactivated the virus but their action was temperature-and time-dependent the methods for ccov inactivation could be applied as animal models to study human coronavirus infection reducing the risk of accidental exposure of researchers to pathogens during routine laboratory procedures
human dengue viruses emerged from primate reservoirs yet paradoxically dengue does not reach high titers in primate models this presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts the dengue virus 2 denv2 -encoded protease cleaves human sting reducing type i interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans we find that both human and sylvatic reservoir dengue viruses universally cleave human sting but not the sting of primates implicated as reservoir species the special ability of dengue to cleave sting is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded 'rg' renders all primate and mouse stings sensitive to viral cleavage dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature
emerging zoonotic viral diseases remain a challenge to global public health recent surveillance studies have implicated bats as potential reservoirs for a number of viral pathogens including coronaviruses and ebola viruses caliciviridae represent a major viral family contributing to emerging diseases in both human and animal populations and have been recently identified in bats in this study we blended metagenomics phylogenetics homology modeling and in vitro assays to characterize two novel bat calicivirus btcalv capsid sequences corresponding to strain btcalv/a10/usa/2009 identified in perimyotis subflavus near little orleans md and bat norovirus we observed that bat norovirus formed virus-like particles and had epitopes and receptor-binding patterns similar to those of human noroviruses to determine whether these observations stretch across multiple bat caliciviruses we characterized a novel bat calicivirus btcalv/a10/usa/2009 phylogenetic analysis revealed that btcalv/a10/usa/2009 likely represents a novel caliciviridae genus and is most closely related to љrecoviruses.љ homology modeling revealed that the capsid sequences of btcalv/a10/usa/2009 and bat norovirus resembled human norovirus capsid sequences and retained host ligand binding within the receptor-binding domains similar to that seen with human noroviruses both caliciviruses bound histoblood group antigens in patterns that overlapped those seen with human and animal noroviruses taken together our results indicate the potential for bat caliciviruses to bind histo-blood group antigens and overcome a significant barrier to cross-species transmission additionally we have shown that bat norovirus maintains antigenic epitopes similar to those seen with human noroviruses providing further evidence of evolutionary descent our results reiterate the importance of surveillance of wild-animal populations especially of bats for novel viral pathogens importance caliciviruses are rapidly evolving viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks associated with significant morbidity and mortality globally the animal reservoirs for human caliciviruses are unknown bats represent critical reservoir species for several emerging and zoonotic diseases recent reports have identified several bat caliciviruses but have not characterized biological functions associated with disease risk including their potential emergence in other mammalian populations in this report we identified a novel bat calicivirus that is most closely related to nonhuman primate caliciviruses using this new bat calicivirus and a second noroviruslike bat calicivirus capsid gene sequence we generated virus-like particles that have host carbohydrate ligand binding patterns similar to those of human and animal noroviruses and that share antigens with human noroviruses the similarities to human rs 2018 bat caliciviruses and human noroviruses are antigenically similar and have overlapping histo-blood group antigen binding profiles mbio 9e00869-18 https//doi
although canine parvovirus cpv and canine enteric coronavirus ccov are important enteric pathogens of dogs and have been studied extensively in different parts of the world there are no reports on these viruses from the caribbean region during 2015-2016 a total of 104 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from puppies and adult dogs with or without hemorrhagic gastroenteritis on the caribbean island of st kitts kna by pcr 25 24% n = 104 samples tested positive for cpv based on analysis of the complete deduced vp2 amino acid sequences 20 of the kna cpv strains were assigned to new cpv-2a also designated as cpv-2a-297a on the other hand the vp2 genes of the remaining 5 strains were partially characterized or could not be sequenced new cpv-2a was the predominant cpv variant in st kitts contrasting the molecular epidemiology of cpv variants reported in most studies from nearby north and south american countries by rt-pcr ccovs were detected in 5 samples 4.8% n = 104 based on analysis of partial m-protein gene the kna ccov strains were assigned to ccov-i genotype and were closely related to ccov-i strains from brazil to our knowledge this is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of cpv and ccov in dogs from the caribbean region and underscores the importance of similar studies in the other caribbean islands
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is one of the most important causative pathogens of swine diarrhea which is widely prevalent throughout the world and is responsible for significant economic losses in the commercial pig industry both domestic and abroad the spike s protein in the pedv capsid structure can carry the major b lymphocyte epitope which induces production of neutralizing antibodies and provides immunoprotective effects moreover the conserved region encoded by the s gene can be considered a target for establishing a new diagnostic method and is a new candidate for vaccine design in this study use of anchorin pgsa' allowed the fusion protein of s-dcpep to express on the surface of recombinant lactobacillus plantarum nc8-psip409-pgsa'-s-dcpep nc8 strain mice were immunized by lavage administration of the recombinant nc8-psip409-pgsa'-s-dcpep which was observed to induce dc activation and high production of siga and igg antibodies in experimental animals while also eliciting production of significantly more iga + b220 + b cells more importantly secretion of cytokines ifn-γ il-4 and il-17 in mice that were vaccinated with nc8-psip409-pgsa'-s-dcpep was remarkably increased the results of our study suggest that nc8-psip409-pgsa'-s-dcpep potently triggers cellular and humoral immune responses the obtained experimental results can provide a theoretical basis that lays the foundation for production of a novel oral vaccine against ped
mucosal vaccination is an effective strategy for generating antigen-specific immune responses against mucosal infections of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv in this study lactobacillus plantarum strains nc8 and wcfs1 were used as oral delivery vehicles containing a psip411-vp1 recombinant plasmid to initiate mucosal and systemic immune responses in guinea pigs guinea pigs were orally vaccinated three doses with nc8-psip411 nc8-psip411-vp1 wcfs1-psip411 wcfs1-psip411-vp1 or milk animals immunized with nc8-psip411-vp1 and wcfs1-psip411-vp1 developed high levels of antigen-specific serum igg iga igm mucosal secretory iga siga and neutralizing antibodies and revealed stronger cell-mediated immune responses and enhanced protection against fmdv challenge compared with control groups the recombinant psip411-vp1 effectively improved immunoprotection against fmdv in guinea pigs
of the 80-plus known infectious agents pathogenic for humans there are now more than 30 vaccines against 26 mainly viral and bacterial infections and these greatly minimize subsequent disease and prevent death after exposure to those agents this article describes the nature of the vaccines from live attenuated agents to subunits their efficacy and safety and the kind of the immune responses generated by those vaccines which are so effective to date all licensed vaccines generate especially specific antibodies which attach to the infectious agent and therefore can very largely prevent infection these vaccines have been so effective in developed countries in preventing mortality after a subsequent infection that attempts are being made to develop vaccines against many of the remaining infectious agents many of the latter are difficult to manipulate they can cause persisting infections or show great antigenic variation a range of new approaches to improve selected immune responses such as immunization with dna or chimeric live vectors viral or bacterial are under intense scrutiny as well as genomic analysis of the agent
with the recent advances in molecular biology and the ability to amplify viral genomes in a non-sequence-dependent manner several previously unidentified human respiratory viruses have been discovered there are accumulating data that some of these new pathogens are responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases particularly in children this review will focus on several of these newly identified pathogens for which there are clinical data implicating a role of these viruses in respiratory tract disease specifically human metapneumovirus human coronaviruses nl63 and hku1 and the human bocavirus antivirals and effective vaccines for these new agents may decrease the burden of respiratory tract diseases
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped caused by an alpha coronavirus is a highly contagious disease and causes high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets isolating pedv neutralizing antibodies from porcine b cells is critical to elucidate the development of pedv neutralizing antibodies and the protective mechanism of pedv infection here we described the isolation of a pedv-neutralizing antibody from the b cell of a vaccinated pig the antibody named pc10 was demonstrated to target the conformational epitope of pedv spike protein specifically bind to the infected cells of pedv genogroup 1 and 2 strains and potently neutralize pedv infection pc10 neutralized pedv infection through interfering with the viral life stages after cellular attachment instead of blocking the attachment of pedv to cells these results suggest that pc10 could be a promising candidate for passive protection and inform pedv vaccine design because of its specificity and substantial neutralization potency
zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans if so then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods these were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans virologists ecologists and computational biologists from academia federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts vectors and reservoirs this workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal h3n2 and pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps to answer the question of where to look prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife bats rodents arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed finally opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps taken together these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps
infection with the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov induces an atypical pulmonary disease with a high lethality rate although the initial sars epidemic was contained sporadic outbreaks of the disease still occur suggesting a continuous need for a vaccine against this virus we therefore explored exosome-based vaccines containing the spike s proteins of sars-cov s-containing exosomes were obtained by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the s protein by those of vsv-g the immunogenicity and efficacy of the s-containing exosomes were tested in mice and compared to an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing the s protein both s-containing exosomes and the adenoviral vector vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers after priming with the sars-s exosomal vaccine and boosting with the adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those observed in the convalescent serum of a sars patient both approaches were effective in a sars-sexpressing tumor challenge model and thus warrant further investigation
background human coronaviruses hcov are a common cause of respiratory illnesses and are responsible for considerable morbidity and hospitalization across all age groups especially in individuals with compromised immunity there are six known species of hcov hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 mers-cov and sars-hcov although studies have shown evidence of global distribution of hcovs there is limited information on their presence and distribution in kenya methods hcov strains that circulated in kenya were retrospectively diagnosed and molecularly characterized a total of 417 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained between january 2009 and december 2012 from around kenya were analyzed by a real time rt-pcr using hcov-specific primers hcov-positive specimens were subsequently inoculated onto monolayers of ll-cmk2 cells the isolated viruses were characterized by rt-pcr amplification and sequencing of the partial polymerase pol gene results the prevalence of hcov infection was as follows out of the 417 specimens 35 8.4 % were positive for hcov comprising 10 2.4 % hcov-nl63 12 2.9 % hcov-oc43 9 2.1 % hcov-hku1 and 4 1 % hcov-229e the kenyan hcov strains displayed high sequence homology to the prototypes and contemporaneous strains evolution analysis showed that the kenyan hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 isolates were under purifying selection phylogenetic evolutionary analyses confirmed the identities of three hcov-hku1 five hcov-nl63 eight hcov-oc43 and three hcov-229e conclusions there were yearly variations in the prevalence and circulation patterns of individual hcovs in kenya this paper reports on the first molecular characterization of human coronaviruses in kenya which play an important role in causing acute respiratory infections among children
to combat variola virus in bioterrorist attacks it is desirable to develop a noninvasive vaccine based on the vaccinia tiantan vtt strain which was historically used to eradicate the smallpox in china we generated a modified vtt mvtt zci by removing the hemagglutinin gene and an 11944 bp genomic region from hindiii fragment c2l to f3l mvtt zci was characterized for its host cell range in vitro and preclinical safety and efficacy profiles in mice despite replication-competency in some cell lines unlike vtt mvtt zci did not cause death after intracranial injection or body weight loss after intranasal inoculation mvtt zci did not replicate in mouse brain and was safe in immunodeficient mice mvtt zci induced neutralizing antibodies via the intranasal route of immunization one time intranasal immunization protected animals from the challenge of the pathogenic vaccinia wr strain this study established proof-of-concept that the attenuated replicating mvtt zci may serve as a safe noninvasive smallpox vaccine candidate
in the production and management of beef and dairy cattle controlling diarrhea is one of the important concerns pathogenic agents of the disease protozoan parasites including cryptosporidium spp are difficult to control making prevention diagnoses and treatment of diarrhea in the present study we investigated a farm with a history of calf deaths over a period of 10 years in order to determine the cause of disease and to clarify the detailed distribution of the pathogens in four examined calves that were reared in calf pens all were positive with cryptosporidium and/or giardia while the other breeding stock and adult cattle were negative molecular analyses revealed that the isolates from calves were c parvum subtype iiaa15g2r1 as a zoonotic and g intestinalis assemblage e other pathogenic bacteria and diarrhea-causing viruses were not detected after treating the calf pens with boiling water and milk of lime ca 2 oocysts of c parvum and cysts of g intestinalis were not found and no additional calves died this is the first report to describe the mixed infection of both parasites in japan
although canine adenovirus cadv is highly prevalent in dogs there is currently a lack of a quick diagnostic method in this study we developed a rapid immunochromatographic strip ics assay using colloidal gold coupled to cadv-2-specific monoclonal antibodies mabs balb/c mice were immunized with a purified cadv-2 suspension and four mabs belonging to two different epitopes were generated and designated as 2c1 7d7 10d1 and 4g1 western blot and protein spectral analysis indicated that the hexon protein of cadv-2 recognized all four mabs the colloidal gold-coupled 7d7 and 2c1 mabs were chosen for inclusion in the rapid ics assay the optimal concentrations of the coating antibody 2c1 the capture antibody 7d7 and the goat anti-mouse antibody were 1.0 mg/ml 10 µg/ml and 2.0 mg/ml respectively the limit of detection was approximately 2.0 × 10 2 tissue culture infective dose tcid 50 /ml other common canine viruses were tested to evaluate the specificity of the ics and positive results were observed for only cadv-1 and cadv-2 the ics test was conducted on 360 samples to detect cadv and the results were compared with those of polymerase chain reaction pcr tests the ics test was found to be a sufficiently sensitive and specific detection method for the convenient and rapid detection of cadv
to express the 3 0 -region 1152 bp of the cag7 gene of helicobacter pylori 51 strain encoding the c-terminal 383 amino acid ct383 aa region of cag7 protein that is known to cover the needle region of t4ss in a live delivery vehicle lactococcus lactis the cag7-ct383 gene was amplified by pcr dna sequence analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of cag7-ct383 of h pylori 51 shared 98.4% and 97.4% identity with h pylori 26695 and j99 respectively intramuscular injection of the gst-cag7-ct383 fusion protein into a rat could raise the anti-cag7 antibody indicating the immunogenicity of the cag7-ct383 protein when the cag7-ct383 gene was cloned in escherichia coli-l lactis shuttle vector pmg36e and transformed into l lactis the transformant could produce the cag7-ct383 protein as evidenced by western blot analysis the cag7-ct383 protein level in the l lactis transformant reached a maximum at the early stationary phase without extracellular secretion the oral administration of the l lactis transformant into mice generated anti-cag7 antibody in serum in five of five mice these results suggest that l lactis transformant expressing cag7-ct383 protein may be applicable as an oral vaccine to induce mucosal and systemic immunity to h pylori
canine parvovirus cpv is a common etiological agent of acute enteritis which occurs globally in domestic and wild carnivores despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines while no specific antiviral therapy for cpv infection exists the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms thus there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of cpv-related disease in this study a cytopathic effect cpe-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen cpv inhibitors from a food and drug administration fda-approved drug library after two rounds of screening seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have >50% cpe inhibition three drugs-nitazoxanide closantel sodium and closantel-with higher anti-cpv effects were further evaluated in f81 cells by absolute pcr quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa the inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the cpv replication cycle and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three cpv variants in addition antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in nitazoxanide-treated f81 cells regardless of cpv infection while closantel sodium-or closantel-treated cells had no proor antiapoptotic effects in conclusion nitazoxanide closantel sodium and closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of cpv since the safety profiles of fda-approved drugs have already been extensively studied these three drugs can potentially become specific and effective anti-cpv drugs
neonates are at high risk for influenza morbidity and mortality due to immune immaturity and lack of priming by prior influenza virus exposure inactivated influenza vaccines are ineffective in infants under six months and to provide protection in older children generally require two doses given a month apart this leaves few options for rapid protection of infants e g during an influenza pandemic we investigated whether advax tm a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles could help overcome neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness we first tested whether it was possible to use advax to obtain single-dose vaccine protection of neonatal pups against lethal influenza infection inactivated influenza a/h1n1 vaccine ih1n1 combined with advax tm adjuvant administered as a single subcutaneous immunization to 7-day-old mouse pups significantly enhanced serum influenzaspecific igm igg1 igg2a and igg2b levels and was associated with a 3-4 fold increase in the frequency of splenic influenza-specific igm and igg antibody secreting cells pups immunized with advax had significantly higher splenocyte influenza-stimulated ifn-␥ il-2 il-4 and il-10 production by cba and a 3-10 fold higher frequency of ifn-␥ il-2 il-4 or il-17 secreting t cells by elispot immunization with ih1n1 + advax induced robust protection of pups against virus challenge 3 weeks later whereas pups immunized with ih1n1 antigen alone had no protection protection by advax-adjuvanted ih1n1 was dependent on memory b cells rather than memory t cells with no protection in neonatal mt mice that are b-cell deficient hence advax adjuvant overcame neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and enabled single-dose protection of pups against otherwise lethal influenza infection thereby supporting ongoing development of advax tm as a neonatal vaccine adjuvant
vaccines inactivated attenuated subunit peptide vector diva nucleic acidtraditional vaccine technologies are based on killed/inactivated and live/attenuated approaches novel killed/inactivated vaccination strategies include antigen subunit protein and peptide vaccines novel live/attenuated vaccination strategies include modified live marker/differentiating infected from vaccinated animals vector and nucleic acid vaccines new vaccine technologies often find their first commercial application within veterinary medicine
taxonomic classification for the coronaviridae can be challenging due to the wide host tropism 30 and highly variable genome of the viruses in this family within the alphacoronavirus genus there is a 31 single species alphacoronavirus 1 that encompasses several biologically distinct viruses of distinct animal 32 species here we carried out phylogenetic analysis of members of the alphacoronavirus genus focusing 33 on the viral spike gene which is a primary driver of viral tropism and pathogenesis we identify two 34 distinct clades a and b within the alphacoronavirus 1 species alphacoronavirus 1 clade a 35 encompasses serotype i fcov and ccov and alphacoronavirus 1 clade b encompasses serotype ii 36fcov and ccov and tgev-like viruses we propose this clade designation along with the newly 37proposed alphacoronavirus 2 species as an improved way to classify the diverse alphacoronavirus 38 genus
bats are reservoirs for many different coronaviruses covs as well as many other important zoonotic viruses we sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within colorado from 2007 to 2009 we detected alphacoronavirus rna in bats of 4 species big brown bats eptesicus fuscus 10% prevalence long-legged bats myotis volans 8% prevalence little brown bats myotis lucifugus 3% prevalence and western long-eared bats myotis evotis 2% prevalence overall juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for cov rna as adult bats at two of the rural sampling sites cov rnas were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study cov rna was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for cov rna and later sampled again all became cov rna negative nucleotide sequences in the rdrp gene fell into 3 main clusters all distinct from those of old world bats similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat indicating that a cov may be capable of infecting bats of different genera these data suggest that ongoing evolution of covs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species alphacoronavirus rna was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations 10% and known to have direct contact with people 19% suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses further cov surveillance studies in bats throughout the americas are warranted
recombination in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is a well-documented phenomenon a high recombination frequency has been reported in experimental conditions both in vitro and in vivo and its role in driving viral evolution has been postulated by several authors however field evidences are rare mainly obtained from large-scale sampling and typically represented by single sequences rather than by groups of circulating "recombinant progenies". the present work was aimed to investigate the gray area between experimental studies and large-scale epidemiological investigations the study was performed on orf5 orf7 and concatenated sequences obtained in our laboratory or available in genbank collected between 2009 and 2012 in northern italy six independent recombinant strains out of 66 concatenated sequences ∼9% were found demonstrating a high recombination frequency respect to previous field studies but comparable to in vitro experiments in silico analysis let speculate that this new strain displayed physicochemical features diverse enough to potentially alter its immunological properties taken altogether the results of our study support previous experimental evidences that depict prrsv to be extremely prone to recombination the limited temporal and geographical spread of recombinant strains however states in favor of a limited fitness of the recombinant progeny compared to parental strains and the marginal role of this phenomenon in prrsv evolution
antibody responses against respiratory bovine coronavirus rbcv infections were monitored in cattle from the onset of a naturally occurring severe shipping fever sf epizootic to complete recovery of affected cattle or fatal outcomes the infection with rbcv was detected in nasal secretions of 86 cattle and 81 of them developed acute respiratory tract disease including fatal pneumonia cattle nasally shedding rbcv at the beginning of the epizootic experienced characteristic primary immune responses with specific antibodies for hemagglutininesterase he and spike s glycoproteins virus shedding in nasal secretions of the majority of the cattle ceased between days 7 and 14 with the appearance of he-and s-specific antibodies nasal samples and lung tissues from 9 of the 10 fatal cases had high titers of rbcv but these cattle had only igm responses to rbcv infections cattle remaining negative in rbcv isolation tests entered this epizootic with antibodies against he and s protection against respiratory tract disease was apparently associated with high level of opsonic and virus-neutralizing igg2 the he and s glycoproteins were recognized earliest by the bovine immune system while the n protein induced antibody responses during the later stage of initial infection and the early stage of reinfection the membrane m glycoprotein was the least immunogenic of the major viral structural proteins
sapelovirus a sv-a formerly known as porcine sapelovirus as a member of a new genus sapelovirus is known to cause enteritis pneumonia polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders in pigs we have recently identified a23-linked sialic acid on gd1a ganglioside as a functional sv-a receptor rich in the cells of pigs and chickens however the role of gd1a in viral pathogenesis remains elusive here we demonstrated that a korean sv-a strain could induce diarrhoea and intestinal pathology in piglets but not in chicks moreover this korean sv-a strain had mild extra-intestinal tropisms appearing as mild non-suppurative myelitis encephalitis and pneumonia in piglets but not in chicks by real-time reverse transcription rt pcr higher viral rna levels were detected in faecal samples than in sera or extra-intestinal organs from virusinoculated piglets immunohistochemistry confirmed that high viral antigens were detected in the epithelial cells of intestines from virus-inoculated piglets but not from chicks this korean sv-a strain could bind the cultured cell lines originated from various species but replication occurred only in cells of porcine origin these data indicated that this korean sv-a strain could replicate and induce pathology in piglets but not in chicks suggesting that additional porcine-specific factors are required for virus entry and replication in addition this korean sv-a strain is enteropathogenic but could spread to the bloodstream from the gut and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs and tissues these results will contribute to our understanding of sv-a pathogenesis so that efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs and vaccines could be developed in the future sv-a can cause asymptomatic and symptomatic diseases in both field and experimental pigs alexandersen et al 2012 kim et al 2016 . the symptomatic disorders include †these authors contributed equally to this work
the lymphoid renal pulmonary and hepatic lesions of naturally occurring postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws affected pigs have been studied by means of immunohistology ten conventionally reared pigs showing acute clinical signs of pmws were selected from a farm on which animal were seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and to aujeszky's disease virus all pigs were positive in tests for porcine circovirus type 2 by ish and ihc monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cd3 cd79a cd45ra 3c3/9 lysozyme sla-ii-dq bl2h5 and mac387 were used to characterise cells in pmws lesions the most relevant changes were reduction or loss of b and t lymphocytes increased numbers of macrophages and partial loss and redistribution of antigen presenting cells throughout lymphoid tissues compared to uninfected controls the characteristics of lymphoid lesions in the present study strongly suggest an immunosuppressive effect of pmws in affected pigs #
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreaks in the arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region raising the concern that a global pandemic could occur here we show that a dna vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids s1 of mers-cov spike s protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice with three immunizations high titers of neutralizing antibodies up to 1 10 4 were generated without adjuvant dna vaccination with the mers-cov s1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigenspecific cd4 + and cd8 + t cells secreting ifn-c and other cytokines both pcdna3.1-s1 dna vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcdna3.1-s1 vaccinated mice protected ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice from mers-cov challenge these results demonstrate that a dna vaccine encoding mers-cov s1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against mers-cov infection
callitrichids marmosets and tamarins are small central and south american nonhuman primates all are considered threatened in the wild and many are on the endangered species list convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora appendix 1 because of their small size and anthropomorphic appeal people are interested in owning callitrichids as pets hand-raised bottle-fed babies are quite charming until sexual maturity at which time they often become aggressive and unpredictable to humans including their owners consequently people should be discouraged from keeping callitrichids as pets if a veterinarian is consulted about callitrichids by a potential owner before purchase it may be possible to offer encouragement toward a more suitable pet e g ferret and sugar glider
lactic acid bacteria lab have been utilized since the 1990s for therapeutic heterologous gene expression the ability of lab to elicit an immune response against expressed foreign antigens has led to their exploration as potential mucosal vaccine candidates lab vaccine vectors offer many attractive advantages simple noninvasive administration usually oral or intranasal the acceptance and stability of genetic modifications relatively low cost and the highest level of safety possible experimentation using lab of the genus lactobacillus has become popular in recent years due to their ability to elicit strong systemic and mucosal immune responses this article reviews lactobacillus vaccine constructs including lactobacillus species antigen expression model organisms and in vivo immune responses with a primary focus on viral and bacterial antigens
mycobacterium tuberculosis m tb is responsible for more deaths globally than any other pathogen the only available vaccine bacillus calmette-guérin bcg has variable efficacy throughout the world a more effective vaccine is urgently needed the immune response against tuberculosis relies at least in part on cd4 + t cells protective vaccines require the induction of antigenspecific cd4 + t cells via mycobacterial peptides presented by mhc class-ii in infected macrophages in order to identify mycobacterial antigens bound to mhc we have immunoprecipitated mhc class-i and class-ii complexes from thp-1 macrophages infected with bcg purified mhc class-i and mhc class-ii peptides and analysed them by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry we have successfully identified 94 mycobacterial peptides presented by mhc-ii and 43 presented by mhc-i from 76 and 41 antigens respectively these antigens were found to be highly expressed in infected macrophages gene ontology analysis suggests most of these antigens are associated with membranes and involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport the sequences of selected peptides were confirmed by spectral match validation and immunogenicity evaluated by ifn-gamma elispot against peripheral blood mononuclear cell from volunteers vaccinated with bcg m tb latently infected subjects or patients with tuberculosis disease three antigens were expressed in viral vectors and evaluated as vaccine candidates alone or in combination in a murine aerosol m tb challenge model when delivered in combination the three candidate vaccines conferred significant protection in the lungs and spleen compared with bcg alone demonstrating proof-of-concept for this unbiased approach to identifying new candidate antigens npj vaccines 2020 52 https//doi
hendra virus hev and nipah virus niv emerged in the last decade of the twentieth century they were the cause of a number of outbreaks of respiratory and neurological disease infecting horses and pigs respectively transmission from infected domestic animal species resulted in human infections as well with high case fatality rates a feature today they continue to cause outbreaks of human and animal disease niv causes yearly disease outbreaks in humans in bangladesh and hev causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses in north eastern australia due to their zoonotic nature they have been ideal candidates for collaborative projects in the one health space bringing public health and animal health professionals together this has lead to insightful epidemiological studies which has resulted in practical disease prevention solutions including a horse vaccine for hev and niv spill-over prevention interventions in the field as more surveillance is undertaken their known distributions have expanded as has the range of reservoir host species the majority of bat species for which there is evidence of henipavirus infection belong to the group known as the old world family of fruit and nectar feeding bats family pteropodidae suborder megachiroptera this review of the bat borne henipaviruses discusses the epidemiology pathology transmission and disease symptoms in these closely related viruses which belong to the genus henipavirus family paramyxoviridae
newcastle disease nd is one of the most important diseases of poultry worldwide in the last decades molecular research has gained a lot of new information about its causative agent newcastle disease virus ndv in poultry industry certain strains of ndv have been used for preventive vaccination for more than 60 years ndv has also been applied to cancer patients with beneficial effects for about 50 years but this is less well known the molecular basis for these differential effects of ndv in birds and man have been elucidated in the last decades and are explained in this review the anti-neoplastic and immune-stimulatory properties in non-permissive hosts such as mouse and man have to do with the strong type i interferon responses induced in these foreign species additionally ndv has the potential to break various types of tumor resistances and also to affect liver fibrosis a main section is devoted to the benefits of clinical application of ndv and ndv-based vaccines to cancer patients reverse genetics technology allowed developing ndv into a vector suitable for gene therapy examples will be provided in which genetically engineered ndv is being used successfully as vector against new emerging viruses
zoonotic viruses of wildlife origin have caused the majority of recent emerging infectious diseases eids that have had signifi cant impacts on human health or economies animal consumption-based food systems ranging from the harvest of free-ranging wild species hereafter wild harvest systems to the in situ stocking of domestic or farmed wild animals hereafter animal production systems have been implicated in the emergence of many of these viruses including hiv ebola sars and highly pathogenic avian infl uenza hpai
the feasibility of developing a prophylactic vaccine against sars was assessed by comparing the immune responses elicited by immunizing mice with a recombinant sars spike glycoprotein s-protein formulated with different adjuvants given by different routes in both young and aged mice an intranasal protollin-formulated s-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific igg in serum comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular alum-adsorbed s-protein vaccine serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing intranasal immunization of young mice with the protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung iga in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung iga was detected following live virus challenge of aged mice no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice
vaccine are partially protected from brsv challenge here we evaluated the impact of vad on the immune response to the brsv-np vaccine and subsequent challenge with brsv our results show that vad calves are unable to respond to the mucosal brsv-np vaccine are afforded no protection from brsv challenge and have significant abnormalities in the inflammatory response in the infected lung we further show that acute brsv infection negatively impacts serum and liver retinol rendering even well-nourished individuals susceptible to vad our results support the use of the calf model for elucidating the impact of nutritional status on mucosal immunity and respiratory viral infection in infants and underline the importance of va in regulating immunity in the respiratory mucosa
henipaviruses are zoonotic viruses that can cause severe and acute respiratory diseases and encephalitis in humans to date no vaccine or treatments are approved for human use the presence of neutralizing antibodies is a strong correlate of protection against lethal disease in animals however since rna viruses are prone to high mutation rates the possibility that these viruses will escape neutralization remains a potential concern in the present study we generated neutralization-escape mutants using 6 different monoclonal antibodies and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness these data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of cocktails of cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues within the glycoprotein that are important for virus replication and virulence

background severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts is an emerging disease that was first reported in china in 2011 it is caused by sfts virus sftsv which is a member of the phlebovirus genus in the bunyaviridae family sftsv has been classified as a bsl3 pathogen there is a need to develop safe and affordable serodiagnostic methods for proper clinical management of infected patients methods the full length nucleocapsid n gene of sftsv yamaguchi strain was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned to an expression vector pqe30 the recombinant r sftsv-n protein was expressed by using escherichia coli e coli expression system and purified under native conditions rsftsv-n protein based indirect igg and igm enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa systems were established to detect specific human igg and igm antibodies respectively one hundred fifteen serum samples from clinically suspected-sfts patients were used to evaluate the newly established systems and the results were compared with the total antibody detecting sandwich elisa system results the native form of recombinant r sftsv-n protein was expressed and purified application of the rsftsv-n protein based indirect igg elisa to the 115 serum samples showed results that perfectly matched those of the total antibody sandwich elisa with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. the rsftsv-n protein based indirect igm elisa missed 8 positive samples that were detected by the total antibody sandwich elisa the sensitivity and specificity of rsftsv-n-igm capture elisa were 90.59 and 100 % respectively the rsftsv-n protein is highly immunoreactive and a good target for use as an assay antigen in laboratory diagnosis its preparation is simpler in comparison with that used for the total antibody sandwich system our rsftsv-n protein-based igg and igm elisa systems have the advantage of distinguishing two types of antibodies and require small volume of serum sample only they are safe to use for diagnosis of sfts virus infection and especially fit in large-scale epidemiological investigations
mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses covs and their hosts including human beings for thousands of years before 2003 two human covs hcovs were known to cause mild illness such as common cold the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and lifethreatening an hcov infection could be the emergence of sars-cov-2 in central china at the end of 2019 has thrusted covs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister sars-cov hcov infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of hcovs would serve us well most hcovs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic the intermediate reservoir hosts of some hcovs are also known identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases investigating cov-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on cov pathogenesis in humans in this review we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven hcovs with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission importantly we compare and contrast the different hcovs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination the current cov disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic is discussed in this context in addition the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted
recently several infectious agents with a zoonotic potential have been detected in different bat species however there is still a lack of knowledge on the transmission dynamics within and between bat species as well as from bats to other mammals to better understand these processes it is important to compare the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their respective hosts in this study we analysed more than 950 urine faeces and oral swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species myotis nattereri myotis bechsteinii myotis daubentonii and plecotus auritus for the presence of coronavirus paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three different regions of germany using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase rt-pcr amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes we detected astrovirus sequences at an overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals with a maximum of 65% in local populations the detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were distinctly lower ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. interestingly the sequence similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between samples from different species sampled at the same location this indicates that host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of certain viruses in bats
old world frugivorous bats have been identified as natural hosts for emerging zoonotic viruses of significant public health concern including henipaviruses nipah and hendra virus ebola virus and marburg virus epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics with particular attention paid to juveniles whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes however little is understood about bat immunology including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans we conducted two separate studies of pregnant pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1 canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive pteropus hypomelanus and 2 hendra virus in wild-caught naturally infected pteropus alecto both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses we found that in both species antibodies were transferred from dam to pup in p hypomelanus pups titers against cdv waned over a mean period of 228.6 days 95% ci 185.4-271.8 and had a mean terminal phase halflife of 96.0 days ci 95% 30.7-299.7 in p alecto pups antibodies waned over 255.13 days 95% ci 221.0-289.3 and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days ci 95% 33.76-80.83 each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months which was longer than has been previously estimated these data will allow for more accurate interpretation of age-related henipavirus serological data collected from wild pteropid bats
control of canine distemper can realistically only be achieved by the use of vaccination the types of vaccine in current use are described together with some of the problems encountered such as interference by maternal antibodies and usage in species other than dogs modified live viral vaccines as used for more than thirty years have proved very effective nevertheless there is scope for some improvement in vaccine efficacy and recent developments in genetic recombinant methods are described
a green fluorescent protein gfp gene was ligated to the lactobacillus reuterispecific nisin-inducible expression-secretion vector pnies generating a pnies-gfp vector capable of secreting the cloned gene as a gfp-fusion protein with fluorescent activity to develop this system as a live vehicle carrying the heat-stable enterotoxin st and heat-labile enterotoxin b lt b of the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec a recombinant 5 0 -st-lt b -3 0 dna fragment was cloned into pnies-gfp the resulting l reuteri/pnies-gfpstlt b system was found to possess the capability of adhering to the mice gut secreting gfpstlt b product at 0.14 and 0.026 pgcell à1 under induced and noninduced conditions respectively further analysis of the gfpstlt b product confirmed its gangliosidebinding ability lt b antigenicity and relative freedom from the st-associated toxicity making it suitable for use as an oral vaccine in mice oral inoculation of the l reuteri/pnies-gfpstlt b culture in mice elicited significant p o 0.01 serum igg and mucosal iga antibodies against the stlt b antigen these immunized mice were subsequently challenged with etec and showed full protection against the fluid influx response in the gut this is the first report of using l reuteri as a vaccine carrier to induce complete immunologic protection against etec
the effect of newly emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin in human populations can be potentially catastrophic and large-scale investigations of such diseases are highly challenging the monitoring of emergence events is subject to ascertainment bias whether at the level of species discovery emerging disease events or disease outbreaks in human populations disease surveillance is generally performed post hoc driven by a response to recent events and by the availability of detection and identification technologies additionally the inventory of pathogens that exist in mammalian and other reservoirs is incomplete and identifying those with the potential to cause disease in humans is rarely possible in advance a major step in understanding the burden and diversity of zoonotic infections the local behavioral and demographic risks of infection and the risk of emergence of these pathogens in human populations is to establish surveillance networks in populations that maintain regular contact with diverse animal populations maia a rabaa ngo tri tue and tran my phuc contributed equally to this work.ó 2015 the author s and to simultaneously characterize pathogen diversity in human and animal populations vietnam has been an epicenter of disease emergence over the last decade and practices at the human/animal interface may facilitate the likelihood of spillover of zoonotic pathogens into humans to tackle the scientific issues surrounding the origins and emergence of zoonotic infections in vietnam we have established the vietnam initiative on zoonotic infections vizions this countrywide project in which several international institutions collaborate with vietnamese organizations is combining clinical data epidemiology high-throughput sequencing and social sciences to address relevant one-health questions here we describe the primary aims of the project the infrastructure established to address our scientific questions and the current status of the project our principal objective is to develop an integrated approach to the surveillance of pathogens circulating in both human and animal populations and assess how frequently they are exchanged this infrastructure will facilitate systematic investigations of pathogen ecology and evolution enhance understanding of viral cross-species transmission events and identify relevant risk factors and drivers of zoonotic disease emergence

novel reassortant avian influenza h7n9 virus and pandemic 2009 h1n1 h1n1pdm virus cause human infections while avian h7n2 and swine h1n1 virus mainly infect birds and pigs respectively there is no robust in vitro model for assessing the infectivity of emerging viruses in humans based on a recently established method we generated long-term expanding 3d human airway organoids which accommodate four types of airway epithelial cells ciliated goblet club and basal cells we report differentiation conditions which increase ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid in addition the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses we also established improved 2d monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids to demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus 3d and 2d differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans h7n9/ah versus h7n2 and h1n1pdm versus an h1n1 strain isolated from swine h1n1sw the humaninfective h7n9/ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective h7n2 virus the highly human-infective h1n1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart h1n1sw collectively we developed differentiated human airway organoids which can morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium these differentiated airway organoids can be applied for rapid assessment of the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses to human airway organoid | proximal differentiation | influenza virus | infectivity
in vitro nitric oxide no has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against a wide range of viruses including influenza a virus therefore we hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide ino would increase survival in vivo by reducing the viral load in c57bl/6 mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza a/wsn/33 h1n1 wsn/33 virus no was delivered to influenza-infected mice either continuously or intermittently at 80 or 160 ppm respectively using both prophylactic and post-infection treatment strategies murine survival and weight loss were assessed and lung viral load was quantified via plaque assay here we report that ino administered prophylactically or post-influenza infection failed to improve survival of infected mice no difference in lung viral load was observed between experimental groups although no has antiviral activity against influenza a virus in vitro ino therapy provided no apparent benefit when used for treatment of influenza a virus infection in vivo
viral infections have been implicated as the cause of cardiomyopathy in several mammalian species this study describes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm and myocarditis associated with feline immunodeficiency virus fiv infection in five cats aged between 1 and 4 years clinical manifestations included dyspnoea in four animals one of which also exhibited restlessness one animal showed only lethargy anorexia and vomiting necropsy examination revealed marked cardiomegaly marked left ventricular hypertrophy and pallor of the myocardium and epicardium in all animals microscopical and immunohistochemical examination showed multifocal infiltration of the myocardium with t lymphocytes and fewer macrophages neutrophils and plasma cells an intense immunoreaction for fiv antigen in the cytoplasm and nucleus of lymphocytes and the cytoplasm of some macrophages was observed via immunohistochemistry ihc ihc did not reveal the presence of antigen from feline calicivirus coronavirus feline leukaemia virus feline parvovirus chlamydia spp or toxoplasma gondii the results demonstrate the occurrence of fiv infection in inflammatory cells in the myocardium of five cats with myocarditis and hcm
infection with either infl uenza a h5n1 virus in 1997 or avian infl uenza a h7n9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment and resulted in high mortality both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian infl uenza a h9n2 viruses that circulate in asian poultry both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase pb2 subunits which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals respectively hong kong aff ected by h5n1 in 1997 and shanghai aff ected by h7n9 in 2013 are two rapidly fl ourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the pearl river delta and yangtze river delta whether the widespread use of the h5n1 vaccine in east asia-with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms-predisposed to the emergence of h7n9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation why h7n9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than h5n1 is still unclear
accurate assessment of neutralizing antibody activities is important either for patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or for animals and volunteers immunized with the experimental vaccines against the sars associated coronavirus scv however the current assay based on the cytopathic effect cpe which has been frequently cited in literature has several limitations the cpe assay relies on the visual observation on the damage of scv infected target cells under a microscope it is subjected to observer variations and it is difficult to generate a quantitative determination of neutralizing activities based on the level of cpe in the current study we established the utility of two additional assays to measure the neutralizing activities against scv the plaque reduction pr and the neutral red staining nrs assays the pr assay described in this study was modified from the traditional viral plaque reduction assay by using an improved crystal staining method to achieve better plague formation in scv infected vero e6 cells the nrs neutralization assay was adopted from a similar system used for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 in this assay the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies was determined by the cell viability which is measured by the uptake of neutral red dye at a 540 . the neutralizing antibody titers can be easily determined with either of the two new assays in this report we described the utility of these two new neutralization assays in measuring the neutralizing activities against scv infection from rabbit sera immunized with various forms of spike protein of scv d
cross-species transmission of viruses poses a sustained threat to public health due to increased contact between humans and other animal species the possibility exists for cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks by using conventional pcr amplification and next generation sequencing we obtained 130 partial or full genome kobuvirus sequences from humans in a sentinel cohort in vietnam and various mammalian hosts including bats rodents pigs cats and civets the evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using bayesian phylogenetic methods we estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses which are most closely related to human kobuviruses the novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in southern vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents we additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents overall our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and porcine group a rotavirus pgar are the main causative agents of acute diarrhea in piglets in south korea pgar is prevalent in piglets naturally infected with pedv piglets naturally co-infected with pedv and pgar appeared to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that was distinct from that commonly observed the aim of this study was to determine the impact of pgar co-infection on pedv pathogenicity in piglets thirty-six colostrum-deprived one-day old large white-duroc crossbred pigs were randomly divided into four equal groups pedv pedv/pgar pgar and control groups the piglets were euthanized at 1 2 or 3 days post-inoculation dpi to measure the villous heightcrypt depth vhcd ratio and to collect fecal samples for rt-pcr and virus isolation no significant differences in mean vhcd ratio and clinical symptoms diarrhea vomiting dehydration and anorexia were observed between the pedv/pgar-infected and pedv-infected groups of piglets at 1 2 and 3 dpi however at 2 and 3 dpi pgar was detected in all fecal samples by rt-pcr and virus isolation these findings failed to detect any interaction between pedv and porcine rotavirus in the small intestines of piglets suggesting that concurrent infection of pgar may not synergistically enhance intestinal villous atrophy of piglets with pedv disease we propose that the severe diarrhea exhibited in pedv and pgar co-infected piglets may be more associated with the immunity level of the host rather than to any synergistic effect of pgar on pedv enteritis
the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov nearly a decade ago with worldwide distribution was believed to be of zoonotic origin from bats with dromedary camels as intermediate hosts there is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus the presence of coronaviruses closely related to mers-cov in ghanaian bats presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species the possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers rectal swabs and serum from cattle sheep goats donkeys and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for mers-cov and a nycteris sp bat coronavirus previously detected in ghana a pan-pcr assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike igg antibodies against the target viruses were used likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms 41.9% that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes livestock were left unconfined on eight farms 25.8% that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes no viral rna or antibodies against the two coronaviruses were detected in any of the livestock species tested cattle sheep goats donkeys and swine are not likely hosts of clade 2c coronaviruses
the sars-associated human coronavirus sars-hcov is a newly described emerging virus conclusively established as the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars this study presents a single-tube rt-pcr assay that can detect with high analytical sensitivity the sars-hcov as well as several other coronaviruses including other known human respiratory coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e species identification is provided by sequencing the amplicon although a rapid screening test by restriction enzyme analysis has proved to be very useful for the analysis of samples obtained during the sars outbreak in toronto canada
enteric viruses play an important role in the brazilian poultry industry due to the economic impact of resulting low yields of broilers layers and breeders the most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in brazil include fowl adenovirus of group i fadv-i chicken parvovirus chpv chicken astrovirus castv avian nephritis virus anv infectious bronchitis virus ibv avian reovirus areo and avian rotavirus artv the aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven brazilian states corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017 this was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds clinical signs and geographical distribution using polymerase chain reaction pcr and reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr techniques twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems stunting syndrome decreases in egg and meat production increased mortality and respiratory signs fadv-i chpv castv anv and artv were mostly detected in young broilers in contrast with ibv which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age these results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent
currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear it is believed that once rabv enters the central nervous system cns virus neutralizing antibodies vnas in the periphery cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier bbb and into the cns furthermore it has been hypothesized that vnas produced in the cns by invading b cells rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the cns are important in clearing rabv from the cns in the present study mouse serum containing vna was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type rabv our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of vnas is crucial in the clearance of rabv from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the bbb permeability remains enhanced this present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing vna therapy for clinical rabies in humans
the objective of the present study was to develop and apply the direct immunohistochemistry d-ihc assay to search for turkey coronavirus tcov antigens in formalin-fixed embedded-paraffin tissues by the use of biotin-labeled polyclonal antibody twenty-eightday-old embryonated turkey eggs n = 50 were inoculated with tcov-purified virus and 3 d after inoculation sections from ileum ileum-cecal junction and ceca were harvested fixed in neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks and used as positive control in addition a total of 100 field samples from ileum ileum-cecal junction and ceca collected from 30 to 45-d-old turkeys poults experiencing an outbreak of acute enteritis were used to search for tcov by the same d-ihc all results were compared with those obtained by conventional rt-pcr and indirect fluorescent antibody assay ifa for all tested
nipah virus is a broadly tropic and highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus in the genus henipavirus whose natural reservoirs are several species of pteropus fruit bats nipah virus has repeatedly caused outbreaks over the past decade associated with a severe and often fatal disease in humans and animals here a new ferret model of nipah virus pathogenesis is described where both respiratory and neurological disease are present in infected animals severe disease occurs with viral doses as low as 500 tcid 50 within 6 to 10 days following infection the underlying pathology seen in the ferret closely resembles that seen in nipah virus infected humans characterized as a widespread multisystemic vasculitis with virus replicating in highly vascular tissues including lung spleen and brain with recoverable virus from a variety of tissues using this ferret model a cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibody m102.4 targeting the henipavirus g glycoprotein was evaluated in vivo as a potential therapeutic agent all ferrets that received m102.4 ten hours following a high dose oral-nasal nipah virus challenge were protected from disease while all controls died this study is the first successful post-exposure passive antibody therapy for nipah virus using a human monoclonal antibody
several studies have shown that cell-mediated immune responses play a crucial role in controlling viral replication as such a candidate sars vaccine should elicit broad cd8+ t-cell immune responses several groups of mice were immunized alone or in combination with sarsnucleocapsid immunogen a high level of specific sars-cd8+ t-cell response was demonstrated in mice that received dna encoding the sars-nucleocapsid protein and xiap as an adjuvant we also observed that co-administration of a plasmid expressing nucleocapsid recombinant protein and montanide/cpg induces high antibody titers in immunized mice moreover this vaccine approach merits further investigation as a potential candidate vaccine against sars
modern human activity fueled by economic development is profoundly altering our relationship with microorganisms this altered interaction with microbes is believed to be the major driving force behind the increased rate of emerging infectious diseases from animals the spate of recent infectious disease outbreaks including ebola virus disease and middle east respiratory syndrome emphasize the need for development of new innovative tools to manage these emerging diseases disseminating vaccines are one such novel approach to potentially interrupt animal to human zoonotic transmission of these pathogens
infiltration and runoff from manured agricultural fields can result in livestock pathogens reaching groundwater and surface waters here we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water the recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 bovine rotavirus group a bovine coronavirus poliovirus sabin iii toxigenic escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels 0.5 215 and 447 ntu twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water ph 7 were seeded with the test organisms and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump flow rate = 1 liter min -1 . retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer ph 9.5 in the direction opposite of sample flow recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr except for c jejuni which was quantified by culture mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33 % for the bacteria and 58 to 16 % for the viruses using bootstrapping techniques combined with analysis of variance recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels however for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for c jejuni glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1
there is an increasing interest in using oral fluid to determine herd health and documenting the circulation of viruses in commercial swine populations but little is known about the stability of viruses in oral fluid hepatitis e virus hev is a zoonotic virus which is widespread in swine herds information on optimal handling methods such as heat treatments freezing and rna stabilization agents is needed to prevent or minimize degradation of viral rna by degradative enzymes the objectives of the study were to determine optimum handling conditions of the oral fluid before rna extraction and to compare the performance of the rneasy protect saliva mini kit which contains a stabilizing agent with that of the qiaamp viral rna mini kit which does not contain a stabilizing agent preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with hev indicated that a heat treatment of 60 • c for 15 min was detrimental to hev rna hev was recovered from 25/25 and 24/25 samples of oral fluid when samples were incubated for ≤24 h at 4 • c and 30 days at −20 • c respectively without a stabilizing agent and extracted with the qiaamp kit in contrast hev rna was detected in 16/25 and 11/25 samples when samples were incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24 h at 37 • c and 30 days at −20 • c respectively and extracted with the rneasy protect saliva kit moreover the mean number of genome copies/ml of hev recovered from oral fluid stored at −20 • c without the stabilizing agent was 2.9 log units higher than oral fluid stored at −20 • c in the presence of the stabilizing agent the recovery of rna from hev f-rna coliphage ms2 and murine norovirus mnv which are surrogates for norovirus was significantly greater when oral fluid was incubated for 24 h at 4 • c than when oral fluid was stabilized with rnaprotect saliva reagent for 24 h at 37 • c where the relative differences between the two processes were 1.4 1.8 and 2.7 log genome copies/ml for ms2 mnv and hev respectively the findings suggest that it is unnecessary to stabilize oral fluid from swine for the detection of viral rna provided the samples are stored at 4 • c or frozen at −20 • c and that the rneasy protect saliva mini kit did not perform well for the detection of viral rna crown
porcine circovirus associated disease pcvad is currently one of the most economically important diseases in the global swine industry porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 is the primary causative agent however co-infection with other swine pathogens such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is often required to induce the full spectrum of clinical pcvad while the specific mechanisms of viral co-infection that lead to clinical disease are not fully understood immune modulation by the co-infecting viruses likely plays a critical role we evaluated the ability of dendritic cells dc infected with prrsv pcv2 or both to induce regulatory t cells t regs in vitro dcs infected with pcv2 significantly increased cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t regs p<0.05 and dcs co-infected with prrsv and pcv2 induced significantly higher numbers of t regs than with pcv2 alone p<0.05 cytokine analysis indicated that the induction of t regs by co-infected dcs may be dependent on tgf-β and not il-10 our data support the immunomodulatory role of pcv2/prrsv co-infection in the pathogenesis of pcvad specifically via t reg mediated immunosuppression keywords porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 dendritic cells porcine circovirus associated disease pcvad regulatory t cell co-infection
an enzyme-linked immunospot elispot has been developed to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv-speci®c antibody secreting cells asc in gut associated lymphoid tissues duodenum and ileum lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes and systemic locations spleen and blood of conventional pigs so as to characterise the mucosal and systemic antibody response generated by the infection with pedv a total number of 28 eleven-day-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with the ®eld isolate of the pedv strain cv-777 diarrhea was observed in 32% of the pigs and virus shedding was demonstrated in 100% between postinoculation day pid 1 and 8 serum igg and iga antibodies to pedv were detected by isotype elisa from pid 12 and 15 respectively reaching maximum values at pid 32 igg and 21 iga pedv speci®c igm asc occurred in all the tissues between pid 4 and 7 with the strongest response in the intestinal lamina propria iga and igg asc responses were evident in the intestinal lymphoid tissues from pid 21 the highest number of speci®c asc corresponded to the duodenum lamina propria in the systemic lymphoid tissues the number of igg and iga asc detected were lower than in the mucosal tissues however in the blood presence of iga asc was constantly detected from pid 14 until the end of the experiment memory antibody response to the pedv was also studied by secondary in vitro stimulation of the mononuclear cells mnc isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes spleen and blood the memory b cell response was prominent at pid 21 and 25 and consisted in igg and iga asc to our knowledge this is the ®rst report to research into the presence and distribution of veterinary immunology and immunopathology 84 2002 1±16 s 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 0 1 0 0 3 8 6 -5 speci®c asc in different locations of the systemic and the gut associated lymphoid tissues after a pedv infection as well as the presence of memory b cells #
identification of dominant t cell epitopes within newly emerging and re-emerging infectious organisms is valuable in understanding pathogenic immune responses and potential vaccine designs however difficulties in obtaining samples from patients or convalescent subjects have hampered research in this direction we demonstrated a strategy tetramer-guided epitope mapping that specific cd41 t cell epitopes can be identified by using pbmc from subjects that have not been exposed to the infectious organism sixteen hla-dr0401-and 14 hla-dr0701-restricted epitopes within spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov were identified among these spike protein residues 159-171 166-178 449-461 and 1083-1097 were identified to contain naturally processed immunodominant epitopes based on strong in vitro t cell responses of pbmc as assayed by tetramer staining to intact spike protein stimulation these immunodominant epitopes were confirmed in vivo in hla-dr0401 transgenic mice by immunizing with spike protein furthermore the epitope-specific t cells from naive donors secreted ifn-g and il-13 upon re-stimulation with corresponding tetramers our study demonstrates a strategy to determine potential immunodominant epitopes for emerging infectious pathogens prior to their epidemic circulation
passive serotherapy can confer immediate protection against microbial infection but methods to rapidly generate human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are not yet available we have developed an improved method for epstein-barr virus transformation of human b cells we used this method to analyze the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov infection and to isolate monoclonal antibodies specific for different viral proteins including 35 antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity ranging from 10 -8 m to 10 -11 m one such antibody confers protection in vivo in a mouse model of sars-cov infection these results show that it is possible to interrogate the memory repertoire of immune donors to rapidly and efficiently isolate neutralizing antibodies that have been selected in the course of natural infection resultsthe antibody response of a patient who recovered from sars-cov infection was analyzed using three assays i elisa using sdsextracted viral proteins ii staining of baby hamster kidney bhk cells transfected with sars-cov spike mrna and iii neutralization
mammalian orthoreoviruses mrvs are widespread and infect virtually all mammals we report here the first case of a natural mutant and reassortant serotype 3 reovirus from mink in china known as mrv3 sd-14 whole-genome sequence analysis showed that the mrv3 sd-14 may have resulted from a reassortment involving mrvs that infected swine humans and mink interestingly the s1 segment which encodes the viral attachment protein r1 which influences viral virulence and cell tropism in the host had a stop codon mutation at amino acid 246 surveillance of the virulence and evolution of mrvs in humans and other animals deserves more attention
aims to determine the seroprevalence of canine respiratory coronavirus crcov in new zealand dogs and to explore associations with age sex breed month and geographical region of sampling and reported presence of clinical signs suggestive of respiratory disease methods a total of 1015 canine serum samples were randomly selected from submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between march and december 2014 and were analysed for crcov antibodies using a competitive elisa logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between seroprevalence of crcov and breed category age sex sampling month region and reported health status of dogs results overall 538/1015 53.0% samples were seropositive for crcov with 492/921 53.4% positive dogs in the north island and 46/94 49% in the south island age of dog sampling month region and presence of abnormal respiratory signs were included in the initial logistic regression model seroprevalence was higher in dogs aged ≥3 compared with ≤2 years p < 0.01 the lowest seroprevalence was observed in july 30/105 28.5% and august 32/100 32% and the highest in june 74/100 74%. seroprevalence in dogs from auckland was higher than in dogs from the hawkes bay manawatu marlborough and waikato regions p < 0.05 abnormal respiratory signs coughing nasal discharge or sneezing were reported for 28/1015 2.8% dogs sampled seroprevalence for crcov tended to be higher among dogs with respiratory signs 67.9 95% ci = 47.6-83.4% than dogs with no reported respiratory signs 52.6 95% ci = 49.5-55.7%. conclusions serological evidence of infection with crcov was present in more than half of the dogs tested from throughout new zealand differences in crcov seroprevalence between regions and lack of seasonal pattern indicate that factors other than external temperatures may be important in the epidemiology of crcov in new zealand clinical relevance our data suggest that crcov should be included in investigations of cases of infectious canine tracheobronchitis particularly if these occur among dogs vaccinated with current vaccines which do not include crcov antigens
up to now only nine whole genome sequences of avian avulavirus 6 aavv-6 had been documented in the world since the first discovery of aavv-6 aavv-6/duck/ hongkong/18/199/77 at a domestic duck in 1977 from hong kong of china very limited information is known about the regularities of transmission genetic and biological characteristics of aavv-6 because of the lower isolation rate and mild losses for poultry industry to better further explore the relationships among above factors an aavv-6 epidemiological surveillance of domestic poultry and wild birds in six provinces of china suspected of sites of inter-species transmission and being intercontinental flyways during the year 2013-2017 was conducted therefore 9872 faecal samples from wild birds and 1642 cloacal and tracheal swab samples from clinically healthy poultry of live bird market lbm were collected respectively
adenoviral vectors are now being explored as vaccine carriers to prevent infectious diseases in humans and animals there are two strategies aimed at the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vectors the first includes an insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the e1 region the second strategy is antigen incorporation into the viral capsid proteins to extend this methodology we have searched for new sites at the human adenovirus serotype 5 major capsid protein hexon for a vaccine antigen insertion to this end we utilized sites in the hexon hypervariable region hvr 7 8 and 9 to display a 15-mer peptide containing the main neutralizing epitope of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus however we could not rescue the viruses with the insertions of the peptide into hvr 8 and 9 consistent with the viruses being unable to tolerate insertions at these sites in contrast the virus with the insertion of the peptide in hvr 7 was viable -growing well in cell culture and the inserted peptide was exposed on the virion surface
background bacterial pneumonia bp is an inflammation of the lower airways and lung parenchyma secondary to bacterial infection the pathogenesis of bp in dogs is complex and the role of canine respiratory viruses has not been fully evaluated objectives the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of viral co-infections in dogs with bp and to assess demographic or clinical variables as well as disease severity associated with viral co-infections animals twenty household dogs with bp caused by opportunistic bacteria and 13 dogs with chronic >30 days tracheobronchitis caused by bordetella bronchiseptica bbtb methods prospective cross-sectional observational study diagnosis was confirmed by clinical and laboratory findings diagnostic imaging and cytologic and microbiologic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage or transtracheal wash fluid canine parainfluenza virus cpiv canine adenovirus canine herpes virus canine influenzavirus canine distemper virus canine respiratory coronavirus crcov and canine pneumovirus as well as b bronchiseptica and mycoplasma spp were analyzed in respiratory samples using pcr assays results cpiv was detected in 7/20 and crcov in 1/20 dogs with bp respiratory viruses were not detected in dogs with bbtb there were no significant differences in clinical variables between bp dogs with and without a viral co-infection conclusion and clinical importance respiratory viruses were found frequently in dogs with bp and may therefore play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of bp clinical variables and disease severity did not differ between bp dogs with and without viral co-infection
in a molecular epidemiology study of hepatitis e virus hev in dromedaries in dubai united arab emirates hev was detected in fecal samples from 3 camels complete genome sequencing of 2 strains showed >20% overall nucleotide difference to known hevs comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed a previously unrecognized hev genotype h epatitis e virus hev belongs to the family hepeviridae and genus hepevirus among humans worldwide hev is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis the disease is generally self-limiting but mortality rates are high among pregnant women and young infants chronic hev infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients such as those who have received a solid organ transplant and those with hiv infection in addition to humans hev has been found in the other mammals pigs boar deer rodents ferrets rabbits mongoose bats cattle sheep foxes minks and horses 1-3 among the 4 known hev genotypes hev1 and hev2 infect only humans whereas hev3 and hev4 can infect humans pigs and other mammals human infections with hev3 and hev4 have been associated with consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat 4 traditionally hev infection is mainly transmitted through water contaminated with infected feces since water supplies and sanitary infrastructures have been improved animals have become a major source of human hev infection we detected hev in fecal samples from dromedary camels in the middle east
background escherichia coli serogroup o157h7 has emerged as an important zoonotic bacterial pathogen causing a range of symptoms from self-limiting bloody diarrhea to severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen one of the important virulence characteristics of e coli o157h7 is the eaea gene encoding the 97 kda surface protein intimin intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic e coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of e coli o157h7 in cattle cattle were orally inoculated with either milk control milk with live attenuated salmonella enterica serovar dublin vector or milk with live attenuated recombinant s dublin expressing intimin vaccinated on days 0 14 and 28 on day 98 all calves were challenged orally with e coli o157h7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant s dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of e coli o157h7 fecal shedding during the first 28 days vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing s dublin strain at a similar level the vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding s dublin from day 28 to day 63 all calves were challenged with e coli o157h7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of e coli o157h7 the amount of e coli o157h7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge we observed a transient clearance of e coli o157h7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves the magnitude of fecal e coli o157h7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal iga oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant s dublin expressing intimin reduced enteric colonization and fecal shedding of e coli o157h7 however the transient clearance of e coli o157h7 was not associated with an enhanced iga-mediated mucosal immune response
although norovirus rotavirus adenovirus and astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water in recent years other viruses such as aichi virus aiv have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods aiv belongs to the genus kobuvirus of the family picornaviridae it is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded rna genome with positive sense 8280 nucleotides and a poly a chain aiv was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions furthermore several studies conducted in japan germany france tunisia and spain showed a high prevalence of aiv antibodies in adults between 80% and 99% which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus the aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human aichi virus aiv discussing the possibles routes of transmission new detection techniques and future research although aiv is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent the low percentage of aiv detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of aiv in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide
the bacterium clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism-a severe intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxin bont and characterized by damage to the nervous system in an effort to develop novel c botulinum immunotherapeutics camelid single-domain antibodies sdabs vhhs or nanobodies could be used due to their unique structure and characteristics in this study vhhs were produced using phage display technology a total of 15 different monoclonal vhhs were selected based on their comlementarity-determining region 3 cdr3 sequences different toxin lethal dose ld 50 challenges with each selected phage clone were conducted in vivo to check their neutralizing potency we demonstrated that modification of neutralizing vhhs with a human immunoglobulin g igg1 fc fragment crystallizable fragment fusionbody vhh-fc significantly increased the circulation time in the blood up to 14 days at the same time vhh-fc showed the protective activity 1000 times higher than monomeric form when challenged with 5 ld 50 . moreover vhh-fcs remained protective even 14 days after antibody administration these results indicate that this vhh-fc could be used as an effective long term antitoxin protection against botulinum type a key contribution fusion of anti-botulinum vhhs to fc fragments significantly increases the protective activity in vivo and serum antibody circulation time
emerging infectious diseases eids in wildlife are major threats both to human health and to biodiversity conservation an estimated 71.8 % of zoonotic eid events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans in addition human diseases are starting to infect wildlife especially non-human primates the chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation poaching and human disease transmission recently several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees therefore we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history we examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzeeborne infectious disease antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees these results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee's history management system in the institute or regional epidemics furthermore captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is a positive-stranded rna virus that grows in macrophages and causes acute pneumonia in pigs prrsv causes devastating losses to the porcine industry however due to its high antigenic variability and poorly understood immunopathogenesis there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment to control prrsv infection the common occurrence of prrsv infection with bacterial infections as well as its inflammatory-driven pathobiology raises the question of the value of antibiotics with immunomodulating properties for the treatment of the disease it causes the macrolide antibiotic tulathromycin tul has been found to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties in cattle and pigs the aim of this study was to characterize the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of tul in prrsv-infected porcine macrophages our findings indicate that blood monocyte-derived macrophages are readily infected by prrsv and can be used as an effective cellular model to study prrsv pathogenesis tul did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers not did it alter viral receptors cd163 and cd169 expression on porcine macrophages in contrast tul exhibited potent immunomodulating properties which therefore occurred in the absence of any direct antiviral effects against prrsv tul had an additive effect with prrsv on the induction of macrophage apoptosis and inhibited virus-induced necrosis tul significantly attenuated prrsv-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling cxcl-8 and mitochondrial ros production and prevented prrsv inhibition of non-opsonized and opsonized phagocytic function together these data demonstrate that tul inhibits prrsv-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus research in live pigs is warranted to assess the potential clinical benefits of this antibiotic in the context of virally induced inflammation and tissue injury 3 / 28 treated with hbss control or tulathromycin 0.5 mg/ml tul for 1h un-infected or infected with with prrsv at an m o i of 0.1 for 12 hours virus and tul+ virus a staining of cells by diff quick reveals that infection with prrsv alters macrophage morphology by giving them a fibroblast-like appearance "virus". tul treatment prevented these alterations "tul+virus". representative microscopic images of 5 independent experiments bar = 50μm b quantitative illustration of the observations shown in a calculated as percentage of macrophages exhibiting morphological changes at least 150 macrophages were counted for each experimental group data represent mean ± sem n = 5 per group # = p<0.05 vs control � = p<0.05 vs tul δ = p<0.05 vs virus
this chapter describes the development of recombinant measles virus mv-based vaccines starting from plasmid dna live-attenuated measles vaccines are very efficient and safe since the availability of a reverse genetic system to manipulate mv genomes and to generate respective recombinant viruses a considerable number of recombinant viruses has been generated that present antigens of foreign pathogens during mv replication thereby robust humoral and cellular immune responses can be induced which have shown protective capacity in a substantial number of experiments for this purpose the foreign antigen-encoding genes are cloned into additional transcription units of plasmid based full-length mv vaccine strain genomes which in turn are used to rescue recombinant mv by providing both full-length viral rna genomes respective anti-genomes together with all protein components of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex after transient transfection of the so-called rescue cells infectious centers form among these transfected cells which allow clonal isolation of single recombinant viruses that are subsequently amplified characterized in vitro and then evaluated for their immunogenicity in appropriate preclinical animal models
next-generation sequencing ngs technologies are becoming increasingly accessible leading to an expanded interest in the composition of the porcine enteric virome in the present study the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic belgian piglet was determined although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed some interesting data were obtained including the second complete genome of a pig group c rotavirus rvc this belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig rvc strain cowden its relatedness to rvc strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to rvcs detected in humans and cows the gene encoding the outer capsid protein vp7 belonged to the rare porcine g3 genotype which might be serologically distinct from most other pig rvc strains a putative novel rvc vp6 genotype was identified as well a group a rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination g11p but was only partially characterized typical pig rva genotypes i5 a8 and t7 were found for the viral proteins vp6 nsp1 and nsp3 respectively interestingly the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus of which the complete genomes were characterized results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets in this study these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance the fast evolution of ngs will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many subclinical enteric viral infections that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques this will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production
blastomycosis is a serious fungal disease of dogs humans and occasionally other mammals caused by geographically restricted thermally dimorphic blastomyces species blastomycosis is primarily a canine disease with approximately ten dogs diagnosed for every human case dogs also develop disease more rapidly thus becoming sentinels for possible human disease human and canine blastomycosis may differ according to epidemiology/epizoology clinical features performance and use of diagnostics and management
the level of passive protection against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev was evaluated by experimentally infecting 12 pregnant gilts with different doses of porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv and challenging their litters at 4 days of age an overall survival rate of 70% was found for piglets nursing the 12 prcv-infected gilts compared to a 16% survival rate for piglets of nine uninfected control gilts six of the prcv-infected gilts had adequate levels of immunity to resist infection with tgev following the challenge of their litters these six completely immuned gilts also solidly protected their litters from tgev as shown by a 96% piglet survival rate through weaning at 3 weeks of age the results suggest that respiratory infection with prcv induces a substantial degree of protective lactogenic immunity against tgev
background emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in north america asia and europe has caused severe economic loss to the global swine industry however the virome of pedv infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown the advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host methods the objective of this study was to characterize the rna virome in pedv-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing specifically 217 pedv-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 us states during 2015-2016 were analyzed results a kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different rna genera besides pedv alphacoronavirus genus including mamastrovirus 52% 113/217 enterovirus 39% 85/217 sapelovirus 31% 67/217 posavirus 30% 66/217 kobuvirus 23% 49/217 sapovirus 13% 28/217 teschovirus 10% 22/217 pasivirus 9% 20/217 and deltacoronavirus 3% 6/217 there were 58 out of 217 piglets 27% have pedv infection alone whereas the remaining 159 73% shed 2 up to 9 different viruses conclusion these findings demonstrated that pedv infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive rna viral flora consisting of four different families astroviridae picornaviridae caliciviridae and coronaviridae

a recombinant fowlpox virus rfpv-ifn␥s1 that co-expressed the infectious bronchitis virus ibv s1 gene and the chicken interferon-␥ gene has been constructed to evaluate the efficacy of the recombinant fowlpox virus vaccine against heterotypic ibv strains 60 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free spf chickens were inoculated with this vaccine and 3 weeks post inoculation challenged with the homotypic ibv strain lx4 and the heterotypic ibv strains lhb lhlj04xi ltj95i and lsc99i antibodies against ibv were detected in vaccinated chickens 1-week post inoculation the number of cd4 + and cd8 + t-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood increased rapidly in the vaccinated groups challenged with strains lx4 lhb and lhlj04xi there were significant differences in the number of cd4 + and cd8 + t-lymphocytes between the vaccinated groups challenged with strains ltj95i and lsc99i and all the control groups the morbidity was below 30% in vaccinated groups challenge with strains lx4 lhb and lhlj04xi but was 40% greater than that in the other groups in addition the lesions and the amount of virus shedding were less severe in the vaccinated groups challenged by strains lx4 lhb and lhlj04xi when compared with the other groups but there was no significant difference in the average body weight of the chickens in all groups all p > 0.05 these results indicate that the rfpv-ifn␥s1 protected chickens against challenge with homotypic ibv strain lx4 and heterotypic strains lhlj04xi and lhb
despite a substantial increase in our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate rna viruses far less is known about the diversity evolution and origin of rna viruses across the diverse phylogenetic range of viruses and particularly in healthy animals that are often only rarely utilized for virological sampling fortunately recent advances in virus discovery using metagenomic approaches are beginning to reveal a multitude of rna viruses in vertebrates other than birds and mammals in particular fish harbor a remarkable array of rna viruses including the relatives of important pathogens in addition despite frequent cross-species transmission the rna viruses in vertebrates generally follow the evolutionary history of their hosts which began in the oceans and then moved to terrestrial habitats over timescales covering hundreds of millions of years

feline infectious peritonitis fip is a fatal disease in wild and domestic cat species although several drugs are expected to be useful as treatments for fip no drugs are available in clinical practice in this study we evaluated the therapeutic effect of combined use of adalimumab an anti-human-tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody ada and itraconazole icz which are presently available to veterinarians the neutralizing activity of ada against ftnf-alpha-induced cytotoxicity was measured in wehi-164 cells ten specific pathogen-free spf cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with type i fipv ku-2 to the cats that developed fip ada 10 mg/animal was administered twice between day 0 and day 4 after the start of treatment icz 50 mg/head sid was orally administered daily from day 0 after the start of treatment ada demonstrated dose-dependent neutralizing activity against rftnf-alpha in an animal experiment 2 of 3 cats showed improvements in fip clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count and a decrease in the plasma alpha 1-agp level were observed after the beginning of treatment one of the cats failed to respond to treatment and was euthanized although the viral gene level in ascites temporarily decreased after the start of treatment ada was found to have neutralizing activity against rftnf-alpha the combined use of ada and icz showed a therapeutic effect for experimentally induced fip we consider these drugs to be a treatment option until effective anti-fipv drugs become available
background bats provide important ecosystem services however current evidence supports that they host several zoonotic viruses including species of the coronaviridae family if bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus spillover may occur therefore strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle however shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions to assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across east africa at different times of the year we assessed via bayesian modeling the hypothesis that chiropterans across species and spatial domains experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle results we found that beyond spatial taxonomic and life history differences coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses conclusions these findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding in these periods contact with bats should be avoided for example by impeding or forbidding people access to caves our proposed strategy provides an alternative to cullingan ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levelsand supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services
cryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular protist parasite infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts and causes significant intestinal disease in both animals and humans as some species are zoonotic cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist however little is known about the genetics of cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of france the aim of this study was to detect and isolate cryptosporidium spp in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves ≤45 days-old in france a total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments french administrative provinces cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent dfa staining method dfa-positive samples were then analysed by pcr-rflp and 18s rrna gene sequencing to determine species cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested pcr analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene product data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis dfa revealed the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 88% samples combined with 18s rrna gene analysis results c parvum was detected in 30 samples subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples 90% of the c parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families iia 24/27 and iid 3/27 four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family iia including the hypertransmissible iiaa15g2r1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide 21/ 27 iiaa17g3r1 1/27 iiaa17g1r1 1/27 and iiaa19g1r1 1/27 two subtypes were recognised within the iid subtype family including iida22g1 2/27 and iida27g1 1/27 these findings illustrate the high occurrence of cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised c parvum isolates with the first description of iiaa17g3r1 iiaa19g1r1 and iid subtypes in france the presence of zoonotic c parvum subtype families iia iid in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic c parvum and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other french regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in france however due to strong inter-species similarities in microscopic size and shape species within this genus require additional identification via genetic characterization molecular biology techniques have enabled the description of species that are highly host-specific as well as others that are capable of infecting many hosts cryptosporidium parvum is considered to be the most prevalent species worldwide and a major zoonotic transmission risk xiao 2010 . using molecular approaches to genetically characterise cryptosporidium spp has facilitated an

although porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a significant pandemic threat in the swine population and has caused significant economic losses information regarding the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with pdcov is scarce hence the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with pdcov was assessed after challenge and rechallenge after the first challenge obvious diarrhea and viral shedding developed successively in all pigs in the four inoculation dose groups from 3 to 14 days postinfection dpi and all pigs recovered no clinical symptoms or viral shedding by 21 dpi all pigs in the four groups exhibited significantly increased pdcov-specific igg iga and virus-neutralizing vn antibody ab titers and ifn-γ levels in the serum after the first challenge all pigs were completely protected against rechallenge at 21 dpi the serum levels of pdcov-specific igg iga and vn abs increased further after rechallenge notably the ifn-γ level declined continuously after 7 dpi in addition the levels of pdcov-specific igg iga and vn abs in saliva increased significantly after rechallenge and correlated well with the serum ab titers furthermore the appearance of clinical symptoms of pdcov infection in conventionally weaned pigs was delayed with reduced inoculation doses in summary the data presented here offer important reference information for future pdcov animal infection and vaccineinduced immunoprotection experiments porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov a member of the genus deltacoronavirus family coronaviridae order nidovirales is a newly isolated and identified virus causing watery diarrhea vomiting and dehydration in pigs of different ages and breeds especially newborn piglets . since first
we have previously reported the generation of the attenuated knu-141112-s del5/orf3 virus by continuous propagation of highly virulent g2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in vero cells the present study aimed to assess the safety of s del5/orf3 and to evaluate its effectiveness as a live vaccine for prime-booster vaccinations reversion to virulence experiments revealed that the s del5/orf3 strain retains its attenuated phenotype and genetic stability after five successive passages in susceptible piglets pregnant sows were primed orally with an s del5/orf3 live vaccine and boosted intramuscularly twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 2-week intervals prior to parturition this sow vaccination regimen completely protected nursing piglets against virulent g2b challenge as evidenced by the increase in survival rate from 0% to 100% and the significant reduction in diarrhea intensity including the amount and duration of pedv fecal shedding in addition despite a 2-3 day period of weight loss in piglets from vaccinated sows after challenge their daily weight gain was recovered at 7 days post-challenge and became similar to that of unchallenged pigs from unvaccinated sows over the course of the experiment furthermore strong antibody responses to pedv were verified in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows with the prime-boost treatment and their offspring altogether our data demonstrated that the attenuated s del5/orf3 strain guarantees the safety to host animals with no reversion to virulence and is suitable as an effective primary live vaccine providing durable maternal lactogenic immunity for passive piglet protection
the immune system is a double-edged sword for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv infection on one edge prrsv has a predilection for immune cells and the disease manifestations can be linked directly to changes in the immune system prrsv appears to replicate extensively if not exclusively in cells of the immune lineage notably macrophages the direct replication of which may lead to immunosuppression precipitate secondary infection and/or mediate disease on the other edge the virus stimulates immunity post-infection that protects an animal from re-infection a vast array of structural and functionally distinct antibody specific to prrsv are generated following infection or vaccination discrete populations of functional antibodies appear at different times and possibly reflect reactivity to different prrsv polypeptides cell-mediated immune responses specific to prrsv can be detected in various exposed pigs as well thus the immune system appears to be intimately involved in both the disease process and protection from disease it is unclear at this state of understanding what immune compartment provides protective immunity is it humoral i e antibodies selective functionally distinct populations of antibodies specific for selected prrsv polypeptides or is cellular immunity essential for protection or both this review will attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge of the complex interaction of the immune system and prrsv 0 1997 elsevier science b v

viruses are often transmitted via food and the environment contamination may be controlled either by preventing its occurrence or by inactivating the contaminating virus the majority of agents transmitted in this way are human enteric viruses produced either in the intestines or the liver they are shed in human feces noroviruses also in vomitus in a broad range of circumstances and they are relatively stable outside the host non-enteric viruses are less often transmitted via foods and are generally less environmentally stable insofar as vaccines are available they are able to prevent fecal shedding viruses shed in feces via the water-carriage toilet may be eliminated by proper treatment and disinfection of the wastewater in the foods context the most effective antiviral measures are cooking and hand washing detection methods are most useful after the fact in investigating outbreaks and devising preventive measures

bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis is caused by clostridium perfringens and leads to sudden death alpha toxin together with perfringolysin o has been identified as the principal toxin involved in the pathogenesis we assessed the potential of alpha toxin as a vaccine antigen using an intestinal loop model in calves we investigated the protection afforded by antisera raised against native alpha toxin or its non-toxic c-terminal fragment against c perfringensinduced intestinal necrosis immunization of calves with either of the vaccine preparations induced a strong antibody response the resulting antisera were able to neutralize the alpha toxin activity and the c perfringens-induced endothelial cytotoxicity in vitro the antisera raised against the native toxin had a stronger neutralizing activity than those against the c-terminal fragment however antibodies against alpha toxin alone were not sufficient to completely neutralize the c perfringens-induced necrosis in the intestinal loop model the development of a multivalent vaccine combining the c-terminal fragment of alpha toxin with other c perfringens virulence factors might be necessary for complete protection against bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis
an immunochromatographic test strip icts for detecting antibodies to rabies virus was developed using colloidal gold particles labeled with rabies virus glycoprotein as the tracer the assay was evaluated using sera from dogs immunized with various commercial rabies vaccines or from dogs in the clinics and sera from dogs immunized with vaccines against pathogens other than rabies virus and negative sera from a wide variety of animal sources including dogs mice and cats which had never been vaccinated the icts was found to be highly specific for antibodies against rabies virus with a detection limit of 0.5 iu/ml as measured by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization favn test compared with the favn test the specificity and sensitivity of icts were 98.2% and 90.4% respectively there was an excellent agreement between results obtained by the icts and favn tests kappa = 0.888 strips stored at 4 • c in a plastic bag with a desiccant retained their specificity and sensitivity for at least 15 months and strips stored at ambient temperature remained stable for 12 months the immunochromatographic test strip may therefore be useful for clinical laboratories lacking specialized equipment and for diagnosis in the field for rapid detection of rabies virus-specific antibodies
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused economic losses in the americas asia and europe in recent years reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation the objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas to detect antibodies against different pedv strains in pig serum a total of 732 serum samples from north american or european pigs were tested samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical g1a pedv or variant genogroup 1 pedv g1b pedv pandemic genogroup 2 pedv g2b pedv or non-infected controls field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown pedv exposure were also used three indirect elisas based on g2b antigens elisas 1 2 and 3 a competitive elisa based on the g2b antigen elisa 4 and a competitive elisa based on the g1a antigen elisa 5 were compared overall the tests had a moderate agreement = 0.61 g1a pedv infected pigs were earliest detected by elisa 3 g1b pedv infected pigs were earliest detected by elisas 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the g2b pedv group elisa 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% 62.1-74.4% and 97.5% 95.2-99.0% for elisa 1 73.7% 71.5-79.6% and 98.4% 96.6-99.5% for elisa 2 86.2% 81.1-90.6% and 91.6% 87.7-94.8% for elisa 3 78.3% 72.8-83.5% and 99.7% 98.2-100% for elisa 4 and 93.5% 90.3-96.0% and 91.2% 83.8-97.9% for elisa 5 differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the pedv antigen used

the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has been identified as sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov but the prophylactic treatment of sars-cov is still under investigation we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated n-terminal fragment of the sars-cov spike s gene from −45 to 1469 designated ad-s n which encoded a truncated s protein 490 amino-acid residues a part of 672 amino-acid s1 subunit and investigated whether this construct could induce effective immunity against sars-cov in wistar rats rats were immunized either subcutaneously or intranasally with ad-s n once a week for three consecutive weeks our results showed that all of the immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the sars-cov spike protein and the sera of immunized rats showed strong capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in vitro histopathological examination did not find evident side effects in the immunized animals these results indicate that an adenoviral-based vaccine carrying an n-terminal fragment of the spike gene is able to elicit strong sars-cov-specific humoral immune responses in rats and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against sars-cov infection
infectious diseases impact african wild dogs lycaon pictus but the nature and magnitude of this threat likely varies among populations according to different factors such as the presence and prevalence of pathogens and land-use characteristics we systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus canine distemper virus cdv canine parvovirus canine coronavirus and babesia spp exposure analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens but babesia was never detected exposure to cdv was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and in the case of protected-unfenced areas likely reside amongst high wildlife densities our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk therefore domestic dogs may be a source of cdv rabies and coronavirus while wildlife may also play an important role in cdv transmission dynamics relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination if prevention of cdv and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy
flaviviruses are globally distributed pathogens causing millions of human infections every year flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses and are mainly transmitted by either ticks or mosquitoes mosquito-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the innate immune response have been well-studied and reviewed extensively thus this review will discuss tick-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the host innate immune response

cryptosporidium species are coccidian parasites with a large capacity to reproduce and to disseminate several species are known to infect farm animals although the economic importance of cryptosporidiosis is highly host species dependent this paper reviews the impact of cryptosporidial infections in livestock and poultry for dierent farm animals the cryptosporidium spp that occur as well as their clinical and pathological features and their interactions with other pathogens are described in addition data concerning the prevalence the transmission and the epidemiology of the disease are mentioned and a description of the economic losses associated with cryptosporidiosis in each of the hosts is given cryptosporidiosis seems to be mainly a problem in neonatal ruminants cryptosporidium parvum is considered to be an important agent in the aetiology of the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome of calves lambs and goat kids causing considerable direct and indirect economic losses avian cryptosporidiosis is an emerging health problem in poultry associated with respiratory disease in chickens and other galliformes and with intestinal disease in turkeys and quails because of limited availability of eective drugs the control of cryptosporidiosis relies mainly on hygienic measures and good management #
non-vaccine streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are increasingly associated with disease we evaluated isolates of the same sequence type st199 but different serotype 15b/c 19a for growth in vitro and pathogenic potential in a chinchilla otitis media model we also developed a qpcr assay to quantitatively assess each isolate circumventing the need for selectable markers in vitro studies showed faster growth of serotype 19a over 15b/c both were equally capable of colonization and middle ear infection in this model serotype 19a is included in new conjugate vaccine formulations while serotype 15b/c is not non-capsular vaccine targets will be important in disease prevention efforts
the progressive anthropization of caves for food resources or economic purposes increases human exposure to pathogens that naturally infect cave-dwelling animals the presence of wild or domestic animals in the immediate surroundings of caves also may contribute to increasing the risk of emergence of such pathogens some zoonotic pathogens are transmitted through direct contact but many others require arthropod vectors such as blood-feeding insects in africa hematophagous insects often play a key role in the epidemiology of many pathogens however their ecology in cave habitats remains poorly known during the last decades several investigations carried out in afrotropical caves suggested the medical and veterinary importance particularly of insect taxa of the diptera order therefore the role of some of these insects as vectors of pathogens that infect cave-dwelling vertebrates has been studied the present review summarizes these findings brings insights into the diversity of cave-dwelling hematophagous diptera and their involvement in pathogen transmission and finally discusses new challenges and future research directions in these studies flying dipterans mosquitoes sand flies and biting midges were collected manually on cave walls or using light traps bat flies were collected manually on captured bats j obame-nkoghe et al r the authors 2017 arthropod vectors inside african caves j obame-nkoghe et al
significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne zika virus zikv recent studies suggest that zikv can also be transmitted sexually further increasing the exposure risk for this virus associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of zikv-infected mothers as well as a rise in the occurrence of guillain barre' syndrome in infected adults importantly there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against zikv infection in this study we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel synthetic dna vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins prme of zikv following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prme dna-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced dna delivery vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity in mice lacking receptors for interferon ifn-α/β designated ifnar − / − immunisation with this dna vaccine induced following in vivo viral challenge 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue in addition passive transfer of non-human primate anti-zikv immune serum protected ifnar − / − mice against subsequent viral challenge this study in nhp and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prme in zikv infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for zikv control and disease prevention in humans
background swine-origin virus infection spreading widely could cause significant economic loss to porcine industry novel antiviral agents need to be developed to control this situation methods in this study we evaluated the activities of five broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides amps against several important swine-origin pathogenic viruses by tcid 50 assay plaque reduction assay and cell apoptosis assay were also used to test the activity of the peptides protection effect of piscidin against pseudorabies virus prv was also examined in mouse model results piscidin piscidin 1 caerin caerin 1.1 and maculatin maculatin 1.1 could inhibit prv by direct interaction with the virus particles in a dose-dependent manner and they could also protect the cells from prv-induced apoptosis among the peptides tested piscidin showed the strongest activity against prv moreover in vivo assay showed that piscidin can reduce the mortality of mice infected with prv conclusion in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that piscidin has antiviral activity against prv
background human psittacosis caused by chlamydia c psittaci is likely underdiagnosed and underreported since tests for c psittaci are often not included in routine microbiological diagnostics source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis this review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature in addition for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated methods a systematic literature search was conducted using four databases pubmed embase scopus and proquest articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human animals and the environment results eighty articles were included which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission the maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys followed by ducks owls and the category 'other poultry'. articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence a genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times including transmission from chickens turkeys guinea fowl peafowl pigeons ducks geese songbirds parrot-like birds and owls conclusions strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys chickens and ducks in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources based on our scoring system the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing
currently there are over 70 licensed vaccines which prevent the pathogenesis of around 30 viruses and bacteria nevertheless there are still important challenges in this area which include the development of more active non-invasive and thermo-resistant vaccines important biotechnological advances have led to safer subunit antigens such as proteins peptides and nucleic acids however their limited immunogenicity has demanded potent adjuvants that can strengthen the immune response particulate nanocarriers hold a high potential as adjuvants in vaccination due to their pathogen-like size and structure they can enhance immune responses by mimicking the natural infection process additionally they can be tailored for non-invasive mucosal administration needle-free vaccination and control the delivery of the associated antigens to a specific location and for prolonged times opening room for single-dose vaccination moreover they allow co-association of immunostimulatory molecules to improve the overall adjuvant capacity the natural and ubiquitous character of polysaccharides together with their intrinsic immunomodulating properties their biocompatibility and biodegradability justify their interest in the engineering of nanovaccines in this review we aim to provide a state-of-the-art overview regarding the application of nanotechnology in vaccine delivery with a focus on the most recent advances in the development and application of polysaccharide-based antigen nanocarriers
the oral mucosa in humans may manifest local or systemic disease and derangements produced by therapeutic agents a significant proportion of therapy-related oral drug reactions appear to be lichenoid reactions erythema multiforme and bullous lesions similar to idiosyncratic or immune-mediated skin reactions 12 inflammation of the oral mucosa oral mucositis is a particular side effect of conventional anticancer drug treatment and this has also been a feature of targeted anticancer therapy both monoclonal antibodies and small molecules 3 systemic disorders produced by anticoagulants or anticancer therapy may also be evident by bleeding or ulceration in the oral cavity buccal ulceration is also described as part of a generalized hypersensitivity reaction to drugs 4 excessive contact by therapeutic agents such as aspirin potassium supplements captopril nicorandil a potassium-channel activator and corticosteroids has been reported to produce local ulceration in the mouth 124à6 the increased use of mouthwashes over the last 20 years has also resulted in a number of reported adverse effects to the buccal mucosa in people 7 while the buccal route offers some advantages for drug delivery because intestinal and first pass hepatic metabolism can be avoided this is limited by the low adsorption across the oral mucosa and the irritant nature of many proposed permeation enhancers 8 the major and minor salivary glands and their secretions also represent an integral part of the protective mechanism of the oral cavity and derangement of saliva production may lead to loss of integrity of the oral mucosa see below many drugs enter the saliva by simple passive diffusion 9 drugs that effect motor coordination can give rise to drooling and disruption of cricopharyngeal coordination 10 drug-induced abnormalities of taste sensation are also welldescribed phenomena occurring in patients indeed many alterations in the oral mucosa are those that are more readily detected by careful clinical observation in people rather than exhaustive histopathological examination of the buccal mucosa in laboratory animals histopathology of preclinical toxicity studies
canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a syndrome where multiple viral and bacterial pathogens are involved sequentially or synergistically to cause illness there is limited information regarding the prevalence of pathogens related to cird in the united states as well as the role of co-infections in the pathogenesis of the syndrome we aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple cird agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses in addition a novel probe-based multiplex real-time pcr was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of mycoplasma m canis and m cynos canine adenovirus canine distemper virus canine parainfluenza virus coronavirus influenza a virus h3n2 and h3n8 bordetella bronchiseptica m canis m cynos and streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus were investigated in specimens from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs received at the athens veterinary diagnostic laboratory results showed low occurrence of classical cird agents such as b bronchiseptica canine adenovirus and distemper virus while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as m canis and m cynos statistical modeling analyses of cird pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation and showed that host factors such as animal age are the most important predictors of disease severity this study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of cird while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is an emerging disease of pigs in several countries in the present study individual sow productivity of berkshire sows exposed to ped virus at different stages of production was compared on a commercial farrow-to-finish farm in kagoshima prefecture japan the clinical presence of ped was observed in the farrowing barn on january 6 2014 and all gilts and sows were immunized on january 9 except those in the farrowing barn the sows were categorized into six groups based on the period in which they were exposed to ped virus between days 0-30 g1 31-60 g2 61-90 g3 or after 91 days of pregnancy g4 during lactation l and after weaning w the control group was not exposed to ped during the period of ped outbreak the study was based on 574 production records the sows of the g4 and l groups had the fewest piglets weaned 4.8 ± 0.4 and 4.0 ± 0.3 pigs respectively p < 0.05 and the greatest pre-weaning mortality 33.1 ± 4.8% and 39.7 ± 4.1% respectively p < 0.05 the number of piglets weaned and pre-weaning mortality however did not differ among the g1 g2 g3 and uninfected groups the g4 and w groups had slightly lesser farrowing rates than the uninfected group p < 0.05 however similar subsequent piglet litter performance as the uninfected group in conclusion the effect of ped on individual sow productivity differed with the production stage in which sows were exposed to ped virus
background dengue caused by one of the four serologically distinct dengue viruses denv-1 to − 4 is a mosquito-borne disease of serious global health significance reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tests along with effective vaccines and vector-control strategies are highly required to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality evaluation studies revealed that many commercially available ns1 antigen ag tests have limited sensitivity to denv-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes these studies indicated the need for development of new ns1 ag detection test with improved sensitivity to denv-4 an ns1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay elisa specific to denv-4 may improve the detection of denv-4 cases worldwide in addition a serotype-specific ns1 ag test identifies both denv and the infecting serotype methods in this study we used a small-ubiquitin-like modifier sumo* cloning vector to express a sumo*-denv-4 rns1 fusion protein to develop ns1 denv-4 specific monoclonal antibodies mabs these newly developed mabs were then optimized for use in an anti-ns1 denv-4 capture elisa the serotype specificity and sensitivity of this elisa was evaluated using i supernatants from denv 1-4-infected vero cell cultures ii rns1s from all the four denv 1-4 and iii rns1s of related flaviviruses yellow fever virus yfv and west nile virus wnv results from the evaluation studies of the newly developed mabs we identified three denv-4 specific anti-ns1 mabs 3h7a9 8a6f2 and 6d4b10 two of these mabs were optimal for use in a denv-4 serotype-specific ns1 capture elisa mab 8a6f2 as the capture antibody and 6d4b10 as a detection antibody conclusion this elisa was sensitive and specific to denv-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three denv 1-3 serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses taken together these data indicated that our mabs are useful reagents for the development of denv-4 immunodiagnostic tests
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like wiv1-coronavirus cov was first isolated from rhinolophus sinicus bats and can use the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in the current study we investigate the ability of wiv1-cov to infect rousettus aegyptiacus bats no clinical signs were observed throughout the experiment furthermore only four oropharyngeal swabs and two respiratory tissues isolated on day 3 post inoculation were found positive for viral rna two out of twelve bats showed a modest increase in coronavirus specific antibodies post challenge in conclusion wiv1-cov was unable to cause a robust infection in rousettus aegyptiacus bats
most glycolipid antigens used for serological tests of mycoplasma pneumoniae are not m pneumonia-specific and can cross-react with other microorganism antigens and body tissues resulting in false positives it is important to identify m pneumonia-specific antigens for serological testing and correct diagnosis two epitopes rp1-534 and rp1-513 of p1 adhesin predicted by bioinformatics were successfully expressed and purified and could be recognized by serum samples from m pneumoniae-infected patients and his tag antibodies by western blot there was no cross-reactivity between the anti-recombinant proteins serum and other respiratory antigens a total of 400 patients were investigated their respiratory specimens tested by pcr and sera tested by a commercial test kit 56 with positive sera and positive respiratory specimens were designated as standard positive serum and 63 patients were designated as standard negative serum the purified recombinant proteins were used as a combination of antigens or separately to test the serum serological test demonstrated that rp1-513 of the c terminal of p1 adhesin is a new candidate antigen with greater sensitivity and specificity for igg and igm serodiagnosis of m pneumoniae-infected patients the results confirmed that rp1-513 could be a useful new antigen for the immunodiagnosis of m pneumoniae infection

background bovine coronavirus bcv is associated with respiratory infections in cattle of all ages however a temporal study to evaluate the effect of bcv immunity on virus shedding and bovine respiratory disease brd incidence in pre-weaned beef calves has not been reported thus we report here a prospective study in three herds of crossbred beef calves n = 817 with endemic bcv serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-bcv antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of bcv and other common viral and bacterial brd pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined times from birth through weaning the calves were monitored for brd and those that developed signs of respiratory disease were sampled for diagnostic testing to discover additional risk factors that could have influenced brd development sequence analysis of the bcv strains circulating in each herd and the prevalence of common opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated results two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves 30.4% were treated for brd prior to weaning 246 of those were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of brd leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group molecular diagnostic testing found bcv and histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of brd treatment between herd analyses revealed anti-bcv serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of brd or bcv shedding though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections analysis of the bcv spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds persistent or recurrent shedding episodes of bcv occurred in some animals treated for brd conclusion co-detection of bcv and h somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens contributed to disease pathogenesis developing appropriate control measures for respiratory bcv infections may help decrease the incidence of pre-weaning brd the role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined
glycyrrhizin is a natural component extracted from the roots of glycyrrhiza glabra in this study we investigated the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv an arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide since the late 1980s our results showed that treatment with glycyrrhizin significantly reduced prrsv proliferation and prrsv-encoded protein expression in a dose-dependent manner mechanistically glycyrrhizin mainly inhibits the penetration stage and has little effect on the steps of adsorption or release of prrsv in its life cycle furthermore we were able to exclude a direct inhibitory action of glycyrrhizin on prrsv particles given these results glycyrrhizin may be a candidate component for a novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs control strategy
rt-pcr targeting the conserved regions the infection rates for mammarenavirus hantaviruses and hev in rodents and shrews were 3.56% 6.89% and 1.66% respectively partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90% and 99% nucleic acid identity with cardamones virus and seoul virus respectively which cause diseases in humans although the present hev strains identified are typically found worldwide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16%. to our knowledge the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus hantaviruses and rat hev strains in rodents and shrews from shenzhen city china our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent-and shrew-borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus and the biodiversity of rat hev isolates in shenzhen city the present work suggests that utilization of good hygiene habits is important to minimize the risk of zoonosis
equine arteritis virus eav is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis eva a respiratory systemic and reproductive disease of horses and other equid species following natural infection 10-70% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed eav in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life recently we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulations of cd3 + t lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro eav infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with longterm carrier status following exposure to the virus in contrast stallions not possessing the cd3 + t lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers a genome wide association study gwas using the illumina equine snp50 chip revealed that the ability of eav to infect cd3 +

background the fruit bat species rousettus aegyptiacus was identified as a potential reservoir for the highly pathogenic filovirus marburg virus to establish a basis for a molecular understanding of the biology of filoviruses in the reservoir host we have adapted a set of molecular tools for investigation of filovirus replication in a recently developed cell line r06e derived from the species rousettus aegyptiacus methodology/principal findings upon infection with ebola or marburg viruses r06e cells produced viral titers comparable to veroe6 cells as shown by tcid 50 analysis electron microscopic analysis of infected cells revealed morphological signs of filovirus infection as described for human-and monkey-derived cell lines using r06e cells we detected an unusually high amount of intracellular viral proteins which correlated with the accumulation of high numbers of filoviral nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm we established protocols to produce marburg infectious virus-like particles from r06e cells which were then used to infect naïve target cells to investigate primary transcription this was not possible with other cell lines previously tested moreover we established protocols to reliably rescue recombinant marburg viruses from r06e cells conclusion/significance these data indicated that r06e cells are highly suitable to investigate the biology of filoviruses in cells derived from their presumed reservoir citation krähling v dolnik o kolesnikova l schmidt-chanasit j jordan i et al 2010 establishment of fruit bat cells rousettus aegyptiacus as a model system for the investigation of filoviral infection plos negl trop dis 48 e802
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov family coronaviridae genus deltacoronavirus is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea/vomiting dehydration and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets pdcov diarrhea was first reported in the us in early 2014 concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv family coronaviridae genus alphacoronavirus the origin of pdcov in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the us still remains unclear in the us since 2013-2014 the newly emerged pdcov and pedv have spread nationwide causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts the current us pdcov strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection similar to pedv infections pdcov infections also cause acute severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia viral rna that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets at present differential diagnosis of pdcov pedv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev is essential to control viral diarrheas in us swine cell culture-adapted us pdcov tc-pdcov strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories tc-pdcov strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates tc-pdcov as a potential vaccine candidate strain a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of epidemic pdcov strains is currently needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine this review focuses on the etiology cell culture isolation and propagation molecular epidemiology disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of pdcov infection
the methods of repeated immunization with inactivated vaccines have been used widely to increase antibody protection against infectious bronchitis virus ibv however compared with dna vaccines these methods usually induce poor cellular responses in the present study specific pathogen-free spf chickens were immunized intramuscularly with a dna vaccine carrying the main ibv structural genes pvax1-s1 pvax1-m and pvax1-n respectively and boosted with the ibv m41 strain inactivated vaccine to assess whether such a new strategy could enhance the immune responses against ibv the protection efficacy of the dna vaccine carrying different structural genes for priming was evaluated further the chickens were immunized primely on day 7 and boosted 2 weeks later after that distribution of the dna vaccine in vivo the percentage of cd4+cd3+ and cd8+cd3+ subgroups of peripheral blood t-lymphocytes and the specific igg and virus neutralizing antibodies were measured chickens were then challenged by the nasal-ocular route with the ibv m41 strain 4 weeks after booster immunization the results demonstrated that priming with a dna vaccine encoding nucleocapsid protein pvax1-n and boosting with the inactivated ibv vaccine led to the dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses and provided up to 86.7% rate of immune protection providing an effective approach to protect chickens from ibv
the efficacy of passively administered bovine antibody for preventing human rotavirus hrv-induced diarrhea was investigated using a gnotobiotic pig model cows were immunized with inactivated hrv serotypes 1 wa and 2 s2 and simian rotavirus serotype 3 sail and immune colostrum and milk were collected antibody concentrates derived from these materials were fed to germ-free piglets that were subsequently inoculated with hrv wa both viral shedding and diarrhea were effectively reduced or eliminated in a dose-dependent manner as a result of hrv immune antibody feeding a quantitative virus-neutralizing vn antibody method permitted assessment of the functional antibody dose required to achieve a 50% reduction of disease pd so . pd so dose levels of 15.8 and 19.5 x 10 6 vn antibody units were determined for inhibition of diarrhea and viral shedding respectively studies reported here provide new information on the quantitative relationship between protective antibody dose and diarrheal disease response human rotavirus hrv-induced gastroenteritis is a wellcharacterized potentially severe disease that is endemic worldwide since its identification as a cause of infant diarrhea in 1973 hrv has been identified as the most common cause of severe childhood diarrhea in developed countries and hrv ranks second only to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli as a cause of severe childhood diarrhea in developing countries . rotaviruses also have been identified as a major cause of diarrheal outbreaks in pediatric hospital nurseries and day care centers in industrialized nations .research directed at both active and passive immunoprophylaxis against hrv-induced diarrhea has been reported efforts to develop a satisfactory hrv vaccine have been extensive passive antibody approaches have been attempted in piglets cows lambs and humans with variable success prevention of hrv infection and spread in human infants by the feeding of colostrum from cows hyperimmunized with noninactivated monovalent or inactivated tetravalent hrv has been reported treatment of infants with acute hrv disease using bovine milk immunoglobulin containing hrv-specific antibody apparently reduces hrv excretion time but not the duration of illness . although not specifically addressed in these reports antibody dose is likely to be of critical importance
a total of 310 bacterial strains isolated from the porcine gastrointestinal tract were tested for their activity against transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus and other enteric pathogens based on activity the strains probio-38 and probio-37 were selected as potential probiotics and identified as lactobacillus plantarum probio-38 and lactobacillus salivarius probio-37 respectively by 16s rrna gene sequencing supernatants of these strains inhibited tge coronavirus in vitro in st cells without any cytopathic effect even after 72 h of incubation both the strains exhibited high survival in synthetic gastric juice the strains were resistant to 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the 13 enteric bacterial pathogens tested these strains also exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics analyzed the inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens as well as the bile tolerance high survival in gastric juice and the antibiotic resistance indicate that the two isolated bacterial strains are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after proper in vivo experiments
the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection was studied in miniature swine piglets the animals were inoculated orally with 2 x 107 plaque-forming units of porcine rotavirus osu strain during the height of diarrhea intestinal function was investigated by in vivo perfusion of a 30-cm segment of proximal jejunum and a 30-cm segment of distal ileum absorption of na + and water decreased and 3-o-methylglucose transport was markedly reduced p < 0.01 compared to control animals mucosal lactase and sucrase levels were depressed in both the jejunum and ileum p < 0.001 na+k+-atpase activity was significantly depressed only in the ileum p < 0.001 these changes were associated with a marked reduction in villous height suggesting that the diarrhea could be an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient carbohydrate malabsorption fresh stool samples were obtained and analyzed immediately for na + k + osmolarity glucose and lactose the osmotic gap was also determined stool osmolarity continually increased from 248 +-20 mosm/liter prior to inoculation to 348 +-20 mosm/liter at 75 +--1 hr postinoculation p < 0.005 the majority of the fecal osmotic gap could be accounted for by the amount of lactose present in the stools stool sodium increased from 34 +-6 mm prior to inoculation to a maximum of 65 +-4 mm at 53 +-l hr postinoculation p < 0.001 there was no significant change in potassium concentration the present investigation suggests that rotavirus-induced diarrhea is due to virus destruction of enterocytes lining the intestinal villi thus reducing the mucosal surface area and important digestive enzymes this destruction leads to an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient primarily carbohydrate malabsorption a possible contributing role of unopposed secretion from the crypt cannot be excluded from this study rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis is a worldwide problem acute diarrhea is the most important manuscript
we have previously described the generation of a novel ebola virus ebov vaccine platform based on a replicationcompetent rabies virus rabv b replication-deficient rabv or c chemically inactivated rabv expressing ebov glycoprotein gp mouse studies demonstrated safety immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these live or inactivated rabv/ebov vaccines here we evaluated these vaccines in nonhuman primates our results indicate that all three vaccines do induce potent immune responses against both rabv and ebov while the protection of immunized animals against ebov was largely dependent on the quality of humoral immune response against ebov gp we also determined if the induced antibodies against ebov gp differ in their target affinity or the isotype our results show that igg1-biased humoral responses as well as high levels of gp-specific antibodies were beneficial for the control of ebov infection after immunization these results further support the concept that a successful ebov vaccine needs to induce strong antibodies against ebov we also showed that a dual vaccine against rabv and filoviruses is achievable therefore addressing concerns for the marketability of this urgently needed vaccine
the brighton collaboration viral vector vaccines safety working group v3swg was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live recombinant viral vector vaccines a recent publication by the v3swg described live attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus rvsv as a chimeric virus vaccine for hiv-1 clarke et al 2016 the rvsv vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines this paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rvsv vector system followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rvsv vaccine against zaire ebolavirus zebov the rvsv-zebov vaccine is a live replication competent vector in which the vsv glycoprotein g gene is replaced with the glycoprotein gp gene of zebov multiple copies of gp are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity the vaccine designated v920 was originally constructed by the national microbiology laboratory public health agency of canada further developed by newlink genetics corp and merck & co and is now in final stages of registration by merck the vaccine is attenuated by deletion of the principal virulence factor of vsv the g protein which also removes the primary target for anti-vector immunity the v920 vaccine caused no toxicities after intramuscular im or intracranial injection of nonhuman primates and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in a rat model in multiple studies cynomolgus macaques immunized im with a wide range of virus doses rapidly developed zebov-specific antibodies measured in igg elisa and neutralization assays and were fully protected against lethal challenge with zebov virus over 20000 people have received the vaccine in clinical trials the vaccine has proven to be safe and well tolerated during the first few days after vaccination many vaccinees experience a mild acute-phase reaction with fever headache myalgia and arthralgia of short duration this period is associated with a low-level viremia activation of anti-viral genes and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited v920 vaccine was used in a phase iii efficacy trial during the west african ebola epidemic in 2015 showing 100% protection against ebola virus disease and it has subsequently been deployed for emergency control of ebola outbreaks in central africa the template
we investigated in a unique setup of animal models and a human lung explant culture biological properties including zoonotic potential of a representative 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hpaiv h5n8 clade 2.3.4.4 group b h5n8b that spread rapidly in a huge and ongoing outbreak series in europe and caused high mortality in waterfowl and domestic birds hpaiv h5n8b showed increased virulence with rapid onset of severe disease and mortality in pekin ducks due to pronounced neuro-and hepatotropism cross-species infection was evaluated in mice ferrets and in a human lung explant culture model while the h5n8b isolate was highly virulent for balb/c mice virulence and transmissibility were grossly reduced in ferrets which was mirrored by marginal replication in human lung cultures infected ex vivo our data indicate that the 2016 hpaiv h5n8b is avian-adapted with augmented virulence for waterfowl but has low zoonotic potential the here tested combination of animal studies with the inoculation of human explants provides a promising future workflow to evaluate zoonotic potential mammalian replication competence and avian virulence of hpaiv
worldwide wild bumble bees bombus spp are experiencing marked declines with potentially up to 11% of species currently under threat recent studies from north america suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species in europe data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the eu since the early 1980s we determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in ireland commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen depending on the cropping system and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites crithidia spp and nosema bombi compared to adjacent populations but were free of tracheal mites the highest prevalence of crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex-and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km we suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities
recently emerged zikv is associated with severe neurological complications 41 such as guillain-barré syndrome in adults and congenital microcephaly in 42 newborns no zikv-specific therapeutics or vaccines are currently available 43 we and others have identified a number of neutralizing antibodies capable of 44 protecting experimental animals from zikv infection however the 3 45 development of these potent antibodies during zikv natural infection remains 46 unknown here we report on the longitudinal analysis of one such antibody 47 zk2b10 using next-generation sequencing ngs bioinformatics and 48 functional analysis we found that the zk2b10 germline-like antibodies 49 possess strong neutralizing activity in vitro and impressive protectivity against 50 lethal zikv infection in vivo these findings suggest that the potent and 51 protective antibody response against zikv can be generated within relative 52 short term with high germline identity which provide great hope and promise for 53 successful vaccine development against zikv.54
a number of apparently normal dog stool samples randomly collected on the sidewalks of paris were examined by electron microscopy the study revealed the presence of viral particles in 27 eases morphological criteria lead to the characterization of rotavirus in 2 specimen coronavirus in 7 and parvovirus in 5 rotavirus particles appeared always alone while coronavirus and parvovirus particles were present together in 5 cases similar particles have been implicated in animal and human gastroenteritis the importance of their presence in canine dejections is discussed in view of pollution by dog stools of urban and suburban areas
in october 2007 a joint anrs-nih workshop was held on "mucosal immunity and hiv/aids vaccines" in veyrier-du-lac france goal of the meeting was to discuss recent developments in the understanding of viral entry and dissemination at mucosal surfaces rationale for designing vaccines to elicit mucosal immune responses by various routes of immunization and the types of immune responses elicited lessons were drawn from existing vaccines against viral mucosal infections from the recent failure of the merck ad5/hiv vaccine and from attempts at mucosal immunization against siv this report summarizes the main concepts and conclusions that came out of the meeting
in this article we review important established newly emergent and potential viral diseases of cats dogs and rabbits topics covered include virus epidemiology disease pathogenesis existing and prospective immunoprophylaxis against the viruses for some feline viruses notably the immunodeficiency virus leukaemia virus and peritonitis virus available vaccines are poorly efficacious but there are good prospects for this a further challenge for the industry is likely to be due to viruses jumping species and the emergence of more virulent variants of established viruses resulting from mutations as has been the case for the canine parvovirus coronaviruses and feline calicivirus
the hemagglutinins has of h9 influenza viruses isolated from birds and mammals of different species were antigenically and genetically analyzed antigenic variants were selected from a/swine/hong kong/10/ 98 h9n2 and a/duck/hokkaido/13/00 h9n2 in the presence of monoclonal antibodies mabs based on the reactivity patterns of these mutants with a panel of mabs at least five non-overlapping antigenic sites were defined using eight mabs which recognized seven distinct epitopes on the h9 ha molecule based on the reactivity patterns with the panel of monoclonal antibodies 21 h9n2 virus strains isolated from birds and mammals were divided into 7 antigenically distinct groups the present findings indicate that it is important to monitor the antigenic variation in h9 influenza viruses the panel of mabs in the present study thus should be useful for detailed antigenic analysis of the h9 has for epidemiological studies the selection of vaccine strains and diagnosis
human papilloma virus-like particles hpv vlp serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for hpv we have previously shown that encapsidation of dna expressing the model antigen m/m2 from respiratory syncytial virus rsv in hpv pseudovirions psv is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally because the hpv capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles in this study we asked 1 whether hpv16 vlp administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to hpv16 and 2 whether hpv16 psvencapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both hpv and the antigen delivered by the transgene mice immunized with hpv16 vlp coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from hpv16 challenge microneedle arrays coated with hpv16-m/m2 or hpv16-f protein genes of rsv were then tested and dose-dependent hpv and f-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization and m/m2-specific t-cell responses were detected post rsv challenge respectively hpv16 psv-f immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with hpv16 psv and had reduced rsv viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal rsv challenge in summary hpv16 psv-encapsidated dna delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against hpv and primed for antibody and t-cell responses to rsv antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids although the immunogenicity of the dna component was just above the dose response threshold the hpv-specific immunity was robust taken together these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized hpv psv could provide a practical thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation
cats exposed to feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv or feline enteric coronavirus fecv cannot be differentiated by serological analysis three synthetic peptides and an e coli recombinant fusion protein generated from fipv 79-1146 spike gene sequence were produced coronavirus positive cat sera reacted to peptide aa 950-990 but were non-reactive to aa137-151 and aa 150-180 peptides as demonstrated by elisa amino acid sequence 97-222 expressed as a galk fusion protein in e coli was tested against coronavirus positive cat sera by western blot analysis only sera from cats exposed to the fipv type-ii strains df-2 or 79-1146 that were exhibiting signs of fip recognized the fusion protein sera from fecv exposed cats did not recognize the 97-222 fusion protein in western blot analysis anti-galk monoclonal antibodies mabs were obtained as mouse ascites fluid from smithkline beecham department of molecular genetics anti-galk mabs were semi-

human coronaviruses hcov are common causes of respiratory illnesses ri despite preexisting humoral immunity sera were obtained near the onset of ri and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for ri from 2009 to 2013 antibodies against common hcov strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases 99 subjects to younger healthy adults 101 subjects virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction of 43hcov-associated illnesses 15 35% occurred in 14 older adults aged ≥60 years and 28 65% in 28 younger adults aged 21-40 years binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults only 16 35.7% of ri with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to hcov increases in binding antibodies with ri were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding and more frequent in younger compared to older adults functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with hcov monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of hcov infections antibody coronavirus immunity neutralization respiratory illness
owing to their unique advantages in simplicity safety scalability and possibility of repeated administrations dna vaccines represent an appealing and competitive immunization approach for a wide array of conditions including but not limited to infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy despite the exciting efficacy observed in preclinical studies dna vaccines have faced challenges in inducing strong immune responses in humans this unexpected poor immunogenicity has severely hampered the translation of dna vaccines from investigational medications to licensed products to overcome this obstacle tremendous efforts have been made to improve antigen expression and enhance immunogenicity among these endeavors in vivo dna electroporation ep has proved to be a breakthrough technology capable of mediating efficient dna uptake and resulting in enhanced antigen expression and vaccine immunogenicity ep-mediated dna delivery has become one of the major platforms used in clinical trials to evaluate dna vaccines in humans in this chapter in addition to ep delivery other progress made in dna vaccine development including plasmid optimization antigen design and immunologic adjuvants is also reviewed finally the use of dna vaccines in the context of clinical trials for infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy is summarized specifically the strategies that allow dna vaccines to overcome antigenic diversity for viral infection and break immune tolerance for cancer therapy are explored based on the advantages of dna vaccines and the immense progress led by the electroporation-mediated vaccine delivery dna vaccines appear to have the potential to fundamentally transform the vaccine field providing important benefits for preventing and curing diseases
respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract mostly causing mild diseases however in vulnerable populations such as newborns infants the elderly and immune-compromised individuals these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract causing a more severe disease e g pneumonia respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes furthermore as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier some of these pathogens like influenza a and sars-cov have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality for a few decades now data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system cns viruses infecting human cns cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy including encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses respiratory viruses may damage the cns as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals virus-induced neuro-immunopathology and/or viral replication which directly causes damage to cns cells virus-induced neuropathology the etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood herein we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in cns infection with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses
we have previously observed that all known hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs are highly divergent from germline antibodies in contrast to bnabs against hendra virus nipah virus and sars coronavirus sars cov we have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature hiv-1-specific bnabs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies to further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived igm libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations they were panned against different hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins envs sars cov protein receptor-binding domain rbd and soluble hendra virus g protein sg despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived igm antibody repertoire no enrichment for binders of envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against rbd and sg one of the selected monoclonal antibodies against the rbd was of high nm affinity with only few somatic mutations these results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnabs against hiv-1 compared to sars cov and hendra virus hiv-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its env in contrast sars cov and hendra virus and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sg and rbd as vaccine immunogens published by elsevier inc
background the emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus nipah virus niv causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans with high fatality rates nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks however a broadly applicable approach for human niv outbreaks in field settings is lacking methods we engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of niv infection in the lower respiratory tract and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models results we show that lethal niv infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates by targeting retention of peptides for niv prophylaxis in the respiratory tract we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention conclusions the experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal niv these results advance the goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and a safe effective delivery method to target niv and other pathogenic viruses
there is an urgent need for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines to protect against chronic bacterial pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis advax ™ is a novel adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles that enhances immunity with a minimal inflammatory profile and has entered human trials to protect against viral pathogens in this report we determined if advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with m tuberculosis the fusion protein cysvac2 comprising the m tuberculosis antigens ag85b rv1886c and cysd rv1285 formulated with advax provided significant protection in the lungs of m tuberculosis-infected mice protection was associated with the generation of cysvac2specific multifunctional cd4 + t cells ifn-γ + tnf + il-2 + . addition to advax of the tlr9 agonist cpg oligonucleotide advax cpg improved both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of cysvac2 immunisation with cysvac2/advax cpg resulted in heightened release of the chemoattractants cxcl1 ccl3 and tnf and rapid influx of monocytes and neutrophils to the site of vaccination with pronounced early priming of cysvac2-specific cd4 + t cells as delta inulin adjuvants have shown an excellent safety and tolerability profile in humans cysvac2/advax cpg is a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation for progression to human trials vaccines are the most efficient tool for preventing diseases caused by infectious pathogens tuberculosis tb remains a major world health problem with over 10 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths per year worldwide 1 . the current vaccine m bovis bcg displays variable protection in humans and new tb vaccines are urgently required 2 . although genetic engineering has allowed the development of recombinant proteins in large scale vaccination with such antigens alone is generally insufficient to elicit a protective immune response and adjuvants are required to enhance antigen-specific immune responses although in many cases the mechanism of adjuvant action is still not well defined 3 . a major challenge is how to achieve a potent adjuvant effect while avoiding reactogenicity and toxicity unfortunately the most potent adjuvants are typically associated with the greatest local and systemic toxicity e g complete freund's adjuvant 4 thereby largely precluding their use particularly in a prophylactic vaccine setting ideally in addition to being safe and well tolerated adjuvants should promote an appropriate humoral and/or cellular immune response have a long shelf-life and be stable biodegradable and cheap to produce
observations were carried out of the interactions between lactobacillus casei 294/89 and enterotoxigenic escherichia cofi ccm 612 olol k99 in uivo in gnotobiotic lambs inoculation with enterotoxigenic e coli etec resulted in diarrhea with a typical clinical picture and patho-anatomical findings e coli adhered to the mucosa of the digestive tract at counts amounting to io5 per cm2 in these lambs disturbances of intestinal biochemical processes became evident proteolytic enzyme activity was significantly reduced preventive administration of lactobacillus cusei inhibited the negative effects of etec in gnotobiotic lambs minimized the clinical signs to those of a very moderate diarrhea in the first 12 h after inoculation and significantly reduced the patho-anatomical findings enterotoxigenic e coli counts decreased by 99.1 and 76% on days 2 and 4 after inoculation respectively and amounted to lo3 per cm'. the inhibitory effects of l casei against e coli were most obvious in the jejunum and ileum the numbers of adhering e cofi increased from the duodenum with the length of the gut etec counts in the digestive tract of lambs that had been preventively treated with l casei amounted to 10' ml-'. it can be assumed that in addition to competitive exclusion the inhibitory effect of l casei upon etec adherence was also mediated by a lactobaciflus-produced substance that inhibited e coli adhesion to the gut mucosa
in the studies presented here dogs were vaccinated against leishmania leishmania chagasi challenge infection using a preparation of leishmania braziliensis promastigote proteins and saponin as adjuvant lbsap vaccination with lbsap induced a prominent type 1 immune response that was characterized by increased levels of interleukin il- 12 and interferon gamma ifn-␥ production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc upon stimulation with soluble vaccine antigen importantly results showed that this type of responsiveness was sustained after challenge infection at day 90 and 885 after l chagasi challenge infection pbmcs from lbsap vaccinated dogs produced more il-12 ifn-␥ and concomitant nitric oxide no when stimulated with leishmania antigens as compared to pbmcs from respective control groups saponin lb-treated or non-treated control dogs moreover transforming growth factor tgf-␤ decreased in the supernatant of slcastimulated pbmcs in the lbsap group at 90 days bone marrow parasitological analysis revealed decreased frequency of parasitism in the presence of vaccine antigen it is concluded that vaccination of dogs with lbsap vaccine induced a long-lasting type 1 immune response against l chagasi challenge infection crown
bats are connected with the increasing numbers of emerging and re-emerging viruses that may break the species barrier and spread into the human population coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats which were considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses i e sars-cov and mers-cov our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10 named as ro-batcov gccdc1 in this report through a two-year follow-up of a special bat population in one specific cave of south china we illustrate that ro-batcov gccdc1 persistently circulates among bats notably through the longitudinal observation we identified the dynamic evolution of ro-batcov gccdc1 in bats represented by continuously recombination events our study provides the first glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warning of potential interspecies transmittable viruses in bats citation
feline coronaviruses fcov colonize the intestinal tract however due to not fully understood mutations they can spread systemically and cause feline infectious peritonitis fip recent studies on human medicine report that gut microbiota is involved in the development of systemic disorders and could influence the immune response to viral diseases the aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the fecal microbiota composition in healthy cats compared to fcov-infected cats with and without fip cats were equally grouped as healthy fcov-negative healthy fcov-positive or fip affected total n = 15 fecal sample were evaluated for the microbiota composition a total of 3231916 sequences were analyzed the samples' alpha-diversity curves did not reach a proper plateau and for the beta-diversity the samples seemed not to group perfectly by category even if the healthy fcov-positive group showed a hybrid microbial composition between fcov-negative and fip groups although there were no taxa significantly linked to the different conditions some peculiar patterns were recognized firmicutes was always the most represented phylum followed by bacteroidetes and actinobacteria in fcov-positive cats the firmicutes and bacteroidetes were respectively over-and under-represented compared to the other groups among fip cats three subjects shared a similar microbiome one cat showed a different microbial profile and the other one had the lowest number of diverse phyla despite the limited number of animals some differences in the fecal microbiome between the groups were observed suggesting to further investigate the possible correlation between gut microbiota and fcov infection in cats
mycobacteriosis caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria ntm is a rising concern in human medicine both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients in cats mycobacteriosis caused by ntm is considered mostly to be a focal or dermal infection with disseminated disease mostly caused by mycobacterium avium we describe three cases of disseminated mycobacteriosis in cats caused by mycobacterium malmoense mycobacterium branderi/shimoidei and m avium with no identified underlying immunosuppression in all cases extracellular mycobacteria were seen in the pulmonary epithelium intestinal lumen and glomerular tufts which could affect the shedding of the organism the present study highlights the importance of mycobacteriosis as a differential even in immunocompetent animals considering the close relationship of owners and pets and the potential presence of free mycobacteria in secretions cats should be considered as a possible environmental reservoir for mycobacteria
the size and heat sensitivity of pleurai effusion disease ped agent or virus pedv propagated in rabbits were examined the infectious particles were estimated to be between 25 and 50 nm by filtration residual infectivity of infectious serum was 0.1 per cent after heating at 56 ° c for 4 hours p e d v and the stockholm agent appeared identical concerning pathogenic and immunogcnic properties by infection experiments and protection tests in rabbits two of the three p e d v isolates were less pathogenic but appeared immunogenically identical to pedv the third isolate obtained from the laboratory which several years previously had supplied material for demonstration of the stoekholm agent differed from p e d v in pathogenic and immunogenie properties serological examinations of paired rabbit sera did not indicate any antigenic relationship between pedv and representative members of the two mammalian eoronavirus antigenic groups i t is concluded that the aetiologicm agent of p e d is a virus not belonging to the eoronaviridae.13 arch viro] 76/3
enterocytozoon bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp are important pathogens causing diarrhea in humans and animals however few studies have been conducted on the infection of e bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp in peafowl up to now the purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and the involved genotypes of cryptosporidium spp and e bieneusi in peafowl in beijing and jiangxi province china in total 258 peafowl fecal samples were collected overall both cryptosporidium spp and e bieneusi had the same prevalence i e 6.59% 17/258 higher infection rates of e bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp were found in the adolescent peafowl the prevalence of e bieneusi in beijing and jiangxi province was 5.23% and 8.57% respectively for cryptosporidium spp the prevalence was 4.58% and 9.52% in beijing and jiangxi province respectively three zoonotic genotypes of e bieneusi were confirmed including two known genotypes genotype peru 6 and d and one novel genotype jxp1 two avian specific species/genotypes of cryptosporidium avian genotype ⅲ and goose genotype ⅰ were identified to our knowledge this is the first report of e bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp occurrence in peafowl in china the findings suggest that peafowl could be reservoirs of e bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp which could be potentially transmitted to humans and other animals and the present survey have implications for controlling e bieneusi and cryptosporidium spp infection in peafowl
marine diseases are becoming more frequent and tools for identifying pathogens and disease reservoirs are needed to help prevent and mitigate epizootics meta-transcriptomics provides insights into disease etiology by cataloguing and comparing sequences from suspected pathogens this method is a powerful approach to simultaneously evaluate both the viral and bacterial communities but few studies have applied this technique in marine systems in 2009 seven harbor seals phoca vitulina stranded along the california coast from a similar brain disease of unknown cause of death ucd we evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of ucds and harbor seals with known causes of death here we determined that ucd stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue however in the bacterial community we identified burkholderia and coxiella burnetii as important pathogens associated with this stranding event burkholderia were 100% prevalent and~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the ucd animals further while c burnetii was found in only 35.7% of all samples it was highly abundant ~94% of the total microbial community in a single individual in this harbor seal c burnetii showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal based on these data we propose that burkholderia taxa and c burnetii are potentially important opportunistic neurotropic pathogens in ucd stranded harbor seals
changes in influenza viruses require regular reformulation of strain-specific influenza vaccines vaccines based on conserved antigens provide broader protection influenza matrix protein 2 m2 is highly conserved across influenza a subtypes to evaluate its efficacy as a vaccine candidate we vaccinated mice with m2 peptide of a widely shared consensus sequence this vaccination induced antibodies that cross-reacted with divergent m2 peptide from an h5n1 subtype a dna vaccine expressing fulllength consensus-sequence m2 m2-dna induced m2specific antibody responses and protected against challenge with lethal influenza mice primed with m2-dna and then boosted with recombinant adenovirus expressing m2 m2-ad had enhanced antibody responses that crossreacted with human and avian m2 sequences and produced t-cell responses this m2 prime-boost vaccination conferred broad protection against challenge with lethal influenza a including an h5n1 strain vaccination with m2 with key sequences represented may provide broad protection against influenza a
vitamin a va has pleiotropic effects on the immune system and is critical for mucosal immune function and intestinal lymphocyte trafficking we hypothesized that oral va supplementation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedvinfected pregnant gilts would enhance the gut-mammary gland-secretory iga axis to boost lactogenic immunity and passive protection of nursing piglets against pedv challenge gilts received daily oral retinyl acetate 30 000 iu starting at gestation day 76 throughout lactation at 3-4 weeks pre-partum va-supplemented pedv + va and non-supplemented pedv gilts were pedv or mock inoculated mock + va and mock respectively pedv + va gilts had decreased mean pedv rna shedding titers and diarrhea scores to determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection all piglets were pedv-challenged at 3-5 days post-partum the survival rate of pedv + va litters was 74.2% compared with 55.9% in pedv litters mock and mock + va litter survival rates were 5.7% and 8.3% respectively pedv + va gilts had increased pedv iga antibody secreting cells and pedv iga antibodies in serum pre-partum and iga + β7 + gut homing cells in milk post piglet challenge compared with pedv gilts our findings suggest that oral va supplementation may act as an adjuvant during pregnancy enhancing maternal iga and lactogenic immune protection in nursing piglets
hantaan virus htnv and puumala virus puuv are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in europe and asia the development of well characterized animal models of htnv and puuv infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of hfrs vaccines and therapeutics in this study we present three animal models of htnv infection hamster ferret and marmoset and two animal models of puuv infection hamster ferret infection of hamsters with a~3 times the infectious dose 99% id 99 of htnv by the intramuscular and~1 id 99 of htnv by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung brain and kidney in contrast infection of hamsters with~2 id 99 of puuv by the intramuscular or~1 id 99 of puuv by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia and a transient detection of viral genome infection of ferrets with a high dose of either htnv or puuv by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected in marmosets a 1000 pfu htnv intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production similarly to the ferret model of htnv infection no renal impairment serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets this is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets
keywords emerging and reemerging infections bioterrorism plant-produced recombinant protein subunit vaccine virus-like particle monoclonal antibody despite progress in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases they continue to present a major threat to public health the frequency of emerging and reemerging infections and the risk of bioterrorism warrant significant efforts towards the development of prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures vaccines are the mainstay of infectious disease prophylaxis traditional vaccines however are failing to satisfy the global demand because of limited scalability of production systems long production timelines and product safety concerns subunit vaccines are a highly promising alternative to traditional vaccines subunit vaccines as well as monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic proteins can be produced in heterologous expression systems based on bacteria yeast insect cells or mammalian cells in shorter times and at higher quantities and are efficacious and safe however current recombinant systems have certain limitations associated with production capacity and cost plants are emerging as a promising platform for recombinant protein production due to time and cost efficiency scalability lack of harboured mammalian pathogens and possession of the machinery for eukaryotic post-translational protein modification so far a variety of subunit vaccines monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins antivirals have been produced in plants as candidate countermeasures against emerging reemerging and bioterrorism-related infections many of these have been extensively evaluated in animal models and some have shown safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials here we overview ongoing efforts to producing such plant-based countermeasures
background epidemiologic studies show a strong association between ureaplasmas and urogenital tract disease in humans since healthy humans can be colonized with ureaplasmas its role as a pathogen remains controversial in order to begin to define the role of the host in disease we developed a rodent model of urinary tract infection uti using fischer 344 f344 rats animals were inoculated with sterile broth 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 7 or 10 9 log cfu of a rat-adapted strain of ureaplasma parvum results infected animals exhibited two distinct profiles asymptomatic uti and uti complicated with struvite urolithiasis inoculum dose of u parvum affected the incidence of uti and 50% to 57% of animals inoculated with ≥ 10 7 cfu of u parvum remained infected p < 0.04 however inoculum dose did not influence immune response to u parvum asymptomatic uti was characterized by a minimal immune response that was predominantly monocytic and lymphocytic with limited lesions and elevated urinary levels of ifn-γ il-18 and mcp-1 p ≤ 0.02 uti complicated with struvite formation was characterized by an exaggerated immune response that was mostly neutrophilic p ≤ 0.0001 with lesions that showed extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia p ≤ 0.0001 and a predominance of il-1α il-1β and gro/kc in the urine p ≤ 0.02 animals with asymptomatic uti also had a significantly high rate of kidney infection p ≤ 0.0005 complications associated with u parvum infection are primarily dependent upon host-specific factors rather than ureaplasma microbial load the immune response in f344 rats is similar to that which occurs in humans with ureaplasmal associated disease therefore this model of infection is a useful tool for elucidating u parvum-host interactions that confer uti and disease
to study the effects of concurrent infection of cryptosporidium parvum with rotavirus and coronavirus in comparison to single infection of rotavirus and coronavirus electrocardiographic parameters and serum electrolytes and microelements are compared between eight calves with concurrent infection and ten calves with single infection calves with single infections had higher serum concentrations of sodium and calcium and less potassium copper and iron which was not statistically significant they also had significantly shorter p and qrs wave amplitudes and longer t wave duration in electrocardiogram patterns
combinations of porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv and either of two swine influenza viruses h1n1 or h3n2 were administered intranasally and by aerosol to six-to eight-week-old specific pathogenfree pigs the clinical responses gross respiratory lesions and growth performances of these pigs were studied and compared with those of single prcv h1n1 or h3n2 and mock-infected animals prcv infection caused fever growth retardation and lung lesions but no respiratory symptoms infection with swine influenza viruses caused rather similar mild symptoms of disease with h1n1 infection being the least severe combined infections with influenza viruses and prcv did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses furthermore viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from 'single' than 'dual' infected animals suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of prcv and swine influenza virus
the feline coronavirus fcov can lead to feline infectious peritonitis fip which the precise cause is still unknown the theory of internal mutation suggests that a less virulent biotype of fcov fecv would lead to another more pathogenic biotype fipv capable of causing fip in this work the 7b gene was amplified from 51 domestic cat plasma samples by semi-nested pcr and tested through phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches the 7b gene of brazilian isolates displayed high conservation a strong correlation between the geographic origin of the viral isolates and their genealogy and its evolution was possibly shaped by a combination of high rates of nucleotide substitution and purifying selection the feline coronavirus fcov is an important pathogen of domestic and wild felids which can cause subclinical infection mild enteritis or lead to feline infectious peritonitis fip a fatal disease characterized by inflammatory lesions of serous membranes and systemic granulomatous lesions of parenchymatous organs .although the precise cause of fip pathogenesis is still unknown several hypotheses have been suggested . the most accepted hypothesis called internal mutation theory suggests that during the replication of fcov in the intestinal epithelium a mutation occurs that makes the virus more pathogenic and able to infect monocytes and macrophages and cause fip . this virulent mutant variant was designated feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv while a variant that leads to enteric infection has been termed feline enteric coronavirus fecv . the precise nature of the mutation responsible for the pathogenesis has not been identified in the fcov genome . nevertheless it has been deduced that the non-structural glycoprotein 7b codified by orf7b plays a determinative role in fcov virulence besides having a strong phylogenetic sign for the differentiation between fecv and fipv .to better understand the molecular epidemiology of fcov in brazilian domestic cats phylogenetic hypothesis and viral population dynamics were inferred from the 7b gene a phylogenetic hypothesis and the reconstructed population history of fcov isolates are presented in this work providing insights into the origins of fcov in brazil furthermore the molecular analysis of 7b gene dispenses considerations about the internal mutation theory regarding to the virulence of the serotypes of fcov this study included samples from 210 domestic cats felis catus of various breeds random selected from different local animal hospitals minas gerais brazil during 2003-2010 one hundred twenty-nine animals were healthy and taken to veterinary clinics for vaccinations and/or elective surgery eighty-one of them showed clinical symptoms of fip such as anorexia weight loss
viral diseases continue to pose some of the greatest challenges to modern medicine for many viral diseases prophylactic vaccines are unlikely to be developed in the near future fortunately effective antiviral therapies have been developed for many of these viruses in this review i will focus on antiviral therapy for herpes simplex virus human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis c virus and human papillomavirus the development of compounds targeting these viruses illustrates many of the principles driving current antiviral development it is likely that our increasing understanding of viral replication and the virus-host interaction will lead to more rapid development of new antivirals in the future ą
objective in order to investigate the clinical and epidemiological rules of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars rates and levels sars coronavirus sars-cov igg antibodies of the patients and community populations from several areas were detected methods indirect immunofluorescent assay ifa and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa were used to detect the sars coronavirus-specific igg antibodies in sera of 1700 including 1453 general populations from hongkong marco guangzhou and peking and 257 sars patients from guangzhou and peking the dynamics of the serum antibodies of sars patients were observed from 3 to 360 days after onset of symptoms results 90% of 257 patient serum specimens after 20 days of disease onset showed positive sars-cov igg either using elisa or ifa . 257 sars patients antibodies titers increased steadily in early 4 to 6 months after onset of sars the titers of most cases came to the peak in the 6th month then antibodies titers declined rapidly in some cases however all specimens still were positive for sars-cov igg in the 48th month conclusions this study suggest that few inapparent infectious patients exist during sars epidemic serum igg antibodies has diagnostic value for sars in the late course of disease and the antibodies present more than 48 months int j biomed sci 2005 1 72-75

crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is an acute often fatal viral disease characterized by rapid onset of febrile symptoms followed by hemorrhagic manifestations the etiologic agent cchf orthonairovirus cchfv can infect several mammals in nature but only seems to cause clinical disease in humans over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of cchf case reports including imported cchf patients and an expansion of cchf endemic areas despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent cchf we here report the development and assessment of the protective efficacy of an adenovirus ad-based vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid protein n of cchfv ad-n in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model of cchf the results show that ad-n can protect mice from cchf mortality and that this platform should be considered for future cchfv vaccine strategies
rift valley fever rvf is an acute febrile zoonotic disease that is caused by the rvf virus rvfv rvf is mainly prevalent on the arabian peninsula the african continent and several islands in the indian ocean near southeast africa rvfv has been classified by the world organisation for animal health oie as a category a pathogen to avoid biological safety concerns associated with use of the pathogen in rvfv neutralization assays the present study investigated and established an rvfv pseudovirus-based neutralization assay this study used the human immunodeficiency virus hiv lentiviral packaging system and rvfv structural proteins to successfully construct rvfv pseudoviruses electron microscopy observation and western blotting indicated that the size structure and shape of the packaged pseudoviruses were notably similar to those of hiv lentiviral vectors infection inhibition assay results showed that an antibody against rvfv inhibited the infective ability of the rvfv pseudoviruses and an antibody neutralization assay for rvfv detection was then established this study has successfully established a neutralization assay based on rvfv pseudoviruses and demonstrated that this method can be used to effectively evaluate antibody neutralization
arabian peninsula to date no approved medical countermeasures mcm are available to combat mers-cov infections several neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies mabs including m336 a germline-like human mab have been chosen as promising mcm for mers-cov however their clinical development has been hindered by the lack of a robust animal model that recapitulate the morbidity and mortality of human infections we assessed the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of m336 by using well-characterized transgenic mice shown to be highly sensitive to mers-cov infection and disease we found that mice treated with m336 prior to or post lethal mers-cov challenging were fully protected compared to control mice which sufferered from profound weight loss and uniform death within days after infection taken together these results support further development of m336 and other human monoclonal antibodies as potential therapeutics for mers-cov infection
astroviruses are one of the leading causes of pediatric gastroenteritis worldwide and are clinically importantly pathogens in the elderly and immunocompromised populations although the use of cell culture systems and small animal models have enhanced our understanding of astrovirus infection and pathogenesis little is known about the immune response to astrovirus infection studies from humans and animals suggest that adaptive immunity is important in restricting classic and novel astrovirus infections while studies from animal models and cell culture systems suggest that an innate immune system plays a role in limiting astrovirus replication the relative contribution of each arm of the immune system in restricting astrovirus infection remains unknown this review summarizes our current understanding of the immune response to astrovirus infection and highlights some of the key questions that stem from these studies a full understanding of the immune response to astrovirus infection is required to be able to treat and control astrovirus-induced gastroenteritis
the human coronavirus nl63 was identified in 2004 and subsequent studies showed its worldwide distribution infection with this pathogen is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases of mild to moderate severity furthermore hcov-nl63 is the main cause of croup in children within this study an optimal protocol for freeze-drying that allows safe and effective preservation of hcov-nl63 infectious material was developed lyophilized virus preparations can be stored either at ambient temperature or at +4 • c in the latter case samples may be stored for at least two months surprisingly conducted analysis showed that hcov-nl63 virions are exquisitely stable in liquid media and can be stored also without preservatives at ambient temperature for up to 14 days
the mucus-dwelling parasite ostertagia ostertagi is one of the most important gastrointestinal nematodes in cattle our group has previously demonstrated the protective capacity of a vaccine against this parasite based on a native activation-associated secreted protein asp1 nasp in combination with the saponin adjuvant quila the aim of the current study was to analyse the effect of both antigen and adjuvant on the cellular and humoral vaccine-induced immune responses by comparing the native asp to a recombinant version expressed in pichia pastoris pasp and replacing quila by aloh 3 . immunization of cattle with the protective nasp+quila vaccine was associated with antigen-induced proliferation of natural killer nk cells combined with ifn-γ secretion and the induction of a mixed igg1/igg2 antibody response asp-specific activation and proliferation of nk cells was also observed in mice following the same vaccination regime replacing quila by aloh 3 or nasp by pasp significantly decreased the capacity of the vaccines to trigger both nk cell activation and antibody responses and failed to induce protection against a challenge infection reduction of the structurally anchoring disulphide bonds of the nasp completely abolished its ability to induce nk cell activation and antibody responses highlighting the importance of protein conformation for the immunostimulatory activity
severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov causes sars the pathogenic mechanisms of sars-cov remain poorly understood six cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with the hku39849 isolate of sars-cov via four routes after intranasal inoculation the virus was isolated from respiratory swabs on days 2-7 postinoculation p i and virus genome was detected in intestinal tissues on day 7 p i virus was not detected after intragastric inoculation after intravenous inoculation infectious virus was isolated from rectal swabs and virus antigen was detected in intestinal cells on day 14 p i after intratracheal i t inoculation virus antigen-positive alveolar cells and macrophages were found in lung and infectious virus was detected in lymphoid and intestinal tissues the peribronchial lymph nodes showed evidence of an immune response lung tissue and ⁄ or fluid and ⁄ or the peribronchial lymph node of the intratracheally inoculated animals had high tnf-a il-8 and il-12 levels sars lung lesions are only generated in monkeys by i t inoculation the virus appears to spread into and perhaps via the intestinal and lymphatic systems it has been suggested previously that viraemia may cause intestinal infections in sars patients
dengue virus denv is a major mosquito-borne pathogen infecting up to 100 million people each year so far no effective treatment or vaccines are available recently highly cross-reactive and infection-enhancing pre-membrane prm-specific antibodies were found to dominate the anti-denv immune response in humans raising concern over vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prm sequences in this study we have isolated a broadly cross-reactive prm-specific antibody d29 during a screen with a non-immunized human fab-phage library against the four serotypes of denv the antibody is capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature denv imdenv in fccr-bearing k562 cells remarkably d29 also cross-reacted with a cryptic epitope on the envelope e protein located to the di/dii junction as evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis this cryptic epitope while inaccessible to antibody binding in a native virus particle may become exposed if e is not properly folded these findings suggest that generation of anti-prm antibodies that enhance denv infection may not be completely avoided even with immunization strategies employing e protein alone or subunits of e proteins
virus-like particles vlps have received considerable attention due to their potential application in veterinary vaccines and in particular vlps from rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus rhdv have successfully shown to be good platforms for inducing immune responses against an inserted foreign epitope in mice the aim of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of chimeric rhdv-vlps as vaccine vectors in pigs for this purpose we have generated chimeric vlps containing a well-known t epitope of 3a protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv firstly rhdv-vlps were able to activate immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pobmdcs in vitro secondly pigs were inoculated twice in a two-week interval with chimeric rhdv-vlps at different doses intranasally or intramuscularly one intramuscularly treated group was also inoculated with adjuvant montanide tm isa 206 at the same time specific igg and iga antibodies against rhdv-vlps were induced and such levels were higher in the adjuvanted group compared with other groups interestingly anti-rhdv-vlp iga responses were higher in groups inoculated intramuscularly than those that received the vlps intranasally two weeks after the last immunisation specific ifn-␥-secreting cells against 3a epitope and against rhdv-vlps were detected in pbmcs by elispot the adjuvanted group exhibited the highest ifn-␥-secreting cell numbers and lymphoproliferative specific t cell responses against 3a epitope and rhdv-vlp this is the first immunological report on the potential use of chimeric rhdv-vlps as antigen carriers in pigs
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a serious infectious threat to public health to create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its potency we attempted to generate a sars inactivated vaccine using sars coronavirus sars-cov strain f69 treated with formaldehyde and mixed with aloh 3 . three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of balb/c mice we found that the mice exhibited specific igm on day 4 and igg on day 8 the peak titers of igg were at day 47 in low-dose group 119200 and high-dose group 138400 whereas in middle-dose group 119200 the peak was at day 40 on day 63 the igg levels reached a plateau neutralization assay demonstrated that the antisera could protect vero-e6 cells from sars-cov's infection analysis of the antibody specificity revealed that the mouse antisera contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of sars-cov furthermore the mouse antisera conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein n polypeptide s4 and s2 than those of proteins m and 3cl these findings suggest that the inactivated sars-cov could preserve its antigenicity and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutralization activity results also suggest that polypeptides originating from protein n or s might be a potential target for the generation of a recombinant sars vaccine
hand-foot-mouth diseases hfmd caused by enterovirus 71 ev71 and coxsackievirus 16 cva16 in children have now become a severe public health issue in the asian-pacific region recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class b member 2 hscarb2 a receptor of ev71 and cva16 as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections in this study hscarb2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described ev71 neutralizing antibody n3 a single injection of n3 effectively inhibited the hfmd-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of ev71 e59 b4 genotype or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 c2 genotype this protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain spinal cord and limb muscles accumulated viral loads and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines were all reduced the protective efficacy of n3 was not observed in animals challenged with cva16 this could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in cva16 these results indicate n3 could be useful in treating severe ev71 infections and the hscarb2-transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates
recombinant canine coronaviruses resembling the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine tgev in a 5 fragment of the s glycoprotein have been detected recently and showed to be present in canine populations the 5 fragment of the s protein s of a tgev-like canine coronavirus ccov strain 174/06 was expressed in an escherichia coli cell-free system the purified recombinant polypeptide was employed to develop an elisa test for the detection of tgev-like ccov-specific antibodies in dog sera four canine sera positive for tgev-like ccov six sera positive to classical ccov-ii strains and 10 negative control sera were examined the recombinant s was not recognized by antibodies to classical ccov-ii as only sera from dogs infected experimentally with tgev-like ccov reacted strongly with the recombinant s polypeptide whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical ccov-ii did not react as classical ccov-ii and tegv-like ccovs are related antigenically the recombinant s elisa is a useful method to investigate serologically the prevalence of tgev-like ccovs in dogs

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is the most important endemic pathogen in the u s swine industry despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols the virus continues to circulate and evolve one of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity here we quantify the co-circulation emergence and sequential turnover of multiple prrsv lineages in a single swine-producing region in the united states over a span of 9 years 200920102011201220132014201520162017 by classifying over 4000 prrsv sequences open-reading frame 5 into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the prrsv population including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008 in addition lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010 but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014 coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage the sequential dominance of different lineages as well as three different sublineages within lineage 1 is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage as host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant this dominant sub- lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible an analysis of patterns of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus this has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of prrsv that have negative impacts on the swine industry constant surveillance on prrsv occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous prrs viruses could shed further light on prrsv immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact
the mammalian major histocompacibility complex mhc has taught both imraunologists and evolutionary biologists a great deal about the patterns and processes that have led to immune defenses driven principally by buman and mouse studies comparative mhc projects among other mammalian species offer certain advantages in connecting mhc genome characters to natural situations we have studied the mhc in the domestic cat and in several wild species of felidae our observations affirm dass i and class ii homology vi/ith other mammalian orders derivative gene duplications during the felidae radiation abundant persistent transspecies allele polymorphism recombination-derived amino acid motifs and inverted ratios of non-synonymous to silent substitutions in the mhc peptide-binding regions consistent with overdominant selection in dass i and ii genes mhc diversity as quantified in population studies is a powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction for several endangered species including cheetahs asiatic lions florida panthers and tigers in two cases florida panther and cbeetah reduced mhc variation may be contributing to uniform population sensitivity to emerging infectious pathogens the felidae species nearly all endangered and monitored for conservation concerns have allowed a glimpse of species adaptation mediated by mhc divergence using comparative inferences drawn from human and mouse models

neospora caninum infection has been reported in a large number of intermediate hosts such as ruminants rabbits mice etc but neosporosis has emerged as a serious disease in cattle and dogs worldwide abortions and other infertility issues have been reported in the infected cows leading to great economic losses in farmers the aim of our study was to assess n caninum seroprevalence in dairy cattle from northern greece region of xanthi by using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique blood samples were collected from 875 holstein -friesian dairy cows and tested for neospora caninum antibodies among the cows that were studied 184 21.03% were positive for n caninum antibodies and concurrently their farms had a known previous history of infertility problems such as abortions increased number of artificial inseminations needed for conception increased rate of returning to estrus and retention of fetal membranes
bovine paratuberculosis ptb is a chronic enteric inflammatory disease of ruminants caused by mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis map that causes large economic losses in the dairy industry spread of ptb is mainly provoked by a long subclinical stage during which map is shed into the environment with feces accordingly detection of subclinical animals is very important to its control however current diagnostic methods are not suitable for detection of subclinical animals therefore the current study was conducted to develop a diagnostic method for analysis of the expression of genes of prognostic potential biomarker candidates in the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with map real-time pcr with nine potential biomarker candidates was developed for the diagnosis of map subclinical infection animals were divided into four groups based on fecal map pcr and serum elisa eight genes timp1 hp serpine1 tfrc mmp9 defb1 defb10 and s100a8 were up-regulated in map-infected cattle p <0.05 moreover roc analysis revealed that eight genes timp1 hp serpine1 tfrc mmp9 defb1 defb10 and s100a8 showed fair diagnostic performance auc0.8 four biomarkers timp1 s100a8 defb1 and defb10 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the pcr positive and elisa negative group pn group and three biomarkers tfrc hp and serpine1 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the pcr negative and elisa positive group np group moreover three biomarkers s100a8 hp and defb10 were considered the most reliable for the pcr positive and elisa positive group pp group taken together our data suggest that real-time pcr based on eight biomarkers timp1 hp serpine1 tfrc mmp9 defb1 defb10 and s100a8 might be useful for diagnosis of jd including subclinical stage cases
porcine coronavirus infections have known as they are specific to pigs with predominantly enteric or respiratory diseases no laboratory animal model is yet been developed in porcine coronaviruses study here we report that development of a transgenic mouse model expressing porcine apn which is susceptible to porcine coronavirus infection the porcine apn transgene was constructed by fusing with mouse proximal apn promoter at 5 terminus and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site at its 3 terminus after screen on pubs from the microinjected mice we confirmed two transgenic lines expressing porcine apn in various organs we confirmed the susceptibility to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus one of the porcine coronaviruses these transgenic mice will be an important tool for research into the porcine coronaviruses
neurologic disease is a major cause of disability in resource-poor countries and a substantial portion of this disease is due to infections of the cns a wide variety of emerging and reemerging viruses contribute to this disease burden new emerging infections are commonly due to rna viruses that have expanded their geographic range spread from animal reservoirs or acquired new neurovirulence properties mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include west nile virus japanese encephalitis virus and chikungunya virus zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses nipah and hendra as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus viruses adapt to new hosts or to cause more severe disease by changing their genomes through reassortment e g influenza virus mutation essentially all rna viruses and recombination e g vaccine strains of poliovirus viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include west nile virus enterovirus 71 and possibly chikungunya virus in addition to these newer challenges rabies polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication measles elimination depends on delivery of two doses of live virus vaccine to a high enough proportion of the population to maintain herd immunity for this highly infectious virus
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev replicates in the small intestine and induces enteritis and watery diarrhea establishment of local immunity in the intestine would thus prevent tgev transmission cpg dna has been reported as a promising mucosal adjuvant in some animals the effects of oral immunization of cpg dna together with inactivated tgev itgev were investigated in this study pigs 6 weeks old were orally immunized with itgev plus cpg dna the tgev-specific iga level in the intestinal tract and the tgev-specific igg level in serum significantly increased following immunization with itgev plus cpg dna p ≤ 0.05 moreover populations of iga-secreting cells cd3+ t lymphocytes and intraepithelial lymphocytes iels in the intestine increased significantly after immunization with itgev plus cpg dna p ≤ 0.05 furthermore the expression of il-6 il-12 and interferon-␥ ifn-␥ in ligated intestine segments increased significantly after injection with itgev plus cpg dna p ≤ 0.05 taken together these data suggest that oral immunization of itgev plus cpg dna elicits a local immune response further studies are required to determine whether this immunity provides protection against tgev in pigs
nearly all licensed vaccines confer protection against infectious diseases by stimulating the production of pathogen-specific abs by b cells understanding the nature of a successful ab response is therefore a fundamental step to providing new tools for the design of novel or better vaccines the isolation and characterization of the ab repertoire produced by antigen-specific b cells has acquired a central importance in the last decade to unravel the response to vaccine antigens dissecting the basic mechanisms that define the dynamics of the ab responses to vaccination and deepening the traditionally vaccines have been developed by cultivating infectious agents and isolating the inactivated whole pathogen or some of its purified components 20 years ago reverse vaccinology enabled vaccine discovery and design based on information deriving from the sequence of microbial genomes rather than via the growth of pathogens today the high throughput discovery of protective human antibodies sequencing of the b cell repertoire and the increasing structural characterization of protective antigens and epitopes provide the molecular and mechanistic understanding to drive the discovery of novel vaccines that were previously impossible we are entering a "reverse vaccinology 2.0" era
given the manifold ways that depression impairs darwinian fitness the persistence in the human genome of risk alleles for the disorder remains a much debated mystery evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations these limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles accordingly studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using pubmed and ovid medline to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study gwas methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment moreover data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia reduced bodily iron stores conservation/withdrawal behavior hypervigilance and anorexia by shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world the pathogen host defense pathos-d hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function
immunomics research uses in silico epitope prediction as well as in vivo and in vitro approaches we inoculated balb/c h2 d mice with 17dd yellow fever vaccine to investigate the correlations between approaches used for epitope discovery elispot assays binding assays and prediction software our results showed a good agreement between elispot and binding assays which seemed to correlate with the protein immunogenicity pred balb/c prediction software partially agreed with the elispot and binding assay results but presented low specificity the use of prediction software to exclude peptides containing no epitopes followed by high throughput screening of the remaining peptides by elispot and the use of mhc-biding assays to characterize the mhc restrictions demonstrated to be an efficient strategy the results allowed the characterization of 2 mhc class i and 17 class ii epitopes in the envelope protein of the yf virus in balb/c h2 d mice
food-grade lactic acid bacteria lab have been safely consumed for centuries by humans in fermented foods thus they are good candidates to develop novel oral vectors constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens for mucosal delivery strategies herein this review summarizes our research up until now on the use of lab as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and dna vaccines most of our work has been based on the model lab lactococcus lactis for which we have developed efficient genetic tools including expression signals and host strains for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins such as antigens cytokines and enzymes resulting recombinant lactococci strains have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in different animal models i against human papillomavirus type 16 hpv-16-induced tumors in mice ii to partially prevent a bovine β-lactoglobulin blg-allergic reaction in mice and iii to regulate body weight and food consumption in obese mice strikingly all of these tools have been successfully transposed to the lactobacillus genus in recent years within our laboratory notably anti-oxidative lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested in two chemically-induced colitis models in parallel we also developed a strategy based on the use of l lactis to deliver dna at the mucosal level and were able to show that l lactis is able to modulate the host response through dna delivery today we consider that all of our consistent data together with those obtained by other groups demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using lab particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains to develop novel therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human clinical trials
respiratory syncytial virus rsv causes severe acute lower respiratory tract disease leading to numerous hospitalizations and deaths among the infant and elderly populations worldwide there is no vaccine or a less effective drug available against rsv infections natural rsv infection stimulates the th1 immune response and activates the production of neutralizing antibodies while earlier vaccine trials that used uv-inactivated rsv exacerbated the disease due to the activation of the allergic th2 response with a focus on th1 immunity we developed a dna vaccine containing the native rsv fusion rsv f protein and studied its immune response in balb/c mice high levels of rsv specific antibodies were induced during subsequent immunizations the serum antibodies were able to neutralize rsv in vitro the rsv inhibition by sera was also shown by immunofluorescence analyses antibody response of the rsv f dna vaccine showed a strong th1 response also sera from rsv f immunized and rsv infected mice reduced the rsv infection by 50% and 80% respectively our data evidently showed that the rsv f dna vaccine activated the th1 biased immune response and led to the production of neutralizing antibodies which is the desired immune response required for protection from rsv infections
to test the potential for parainfluenza virus 5 piv5-based vectors to provide protection from vaccinia virus vacv infection piv5 was engineered to express secreted vacv l1r and b5r proteins two important antigens for neutralization of intracellular mature imv and extracellular enveloped eev virions respectively protection of mice from lethal intranasal vacv challenge required intranasal immunization with piv5-l1r/b5r in a prime-boost protocol and correlated with low vacv-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-vacv neutralizing antibody mice immunized with piv5-l1r/b5r showed some disease symptoms following vacv challenge such as loss of weight and hunching but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice while immunization with piv5 expressing b5r alone conferred at least some protection the most effective immunization included the piv5 vector expressing l1r alone or in combination with piv5-b5r piv5-l1r/b5r vectors elicited protection from vacv challenge even when cd8+ cells were depleted but not in the case of mice that were defective in b cell production mice were protected from vacv challenge out to at least 1.5 years after immunization with piv5-l1r/b5r vectors and showed significant levels of anti-vacv neutralizing antibodies these results demonstrate the potential for piv5-based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as vacv but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly immunogenic viral proteins
cryptosporidiosis of calves is caused by the enteroprotozoan cryptosporidium spp the disease results in intense diarrhea of calves associated with substantial economic losses in dairy farming worldwide the aim of this study was to determine calf herd and within-herd cryptosporidium prevalence and identify cryptosporidium species and subtypes in calves with diarrhea in intensive dairy herds in central argentina a total of 1073 fecal samples were collected from 54 randomly selected dairy herds cryptosporidium-oocysts were isolated and concentrated from fecal samples using formol-ether and detected by light microscopy with the modified ziehl-neelsen technique overall prevalence of oocyst-excreting calves was found to be 25.5% 274/ 1073 95% c i 22.9 28.1%. of the herds studied 89% 48/54 included at least one infected calf whereas within-herd prevalence ranged from the absence of infection to 57% 20/35 a highly significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and c parvum infection χ 2 = 55.89 p < 0.001 for species determination genomic dna isolated from oocystpositive fecal samples was subjected to pcr-rflp of the 18s rrna gene resulting exclusively in cryptosporidium parvum identification c parvum isolates of calves displaying diarrhea and high rate of excretion of oocysts were subtyped by pcr amplification and direct sequencing of the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene altogether five gp60 subtypes designated iiaa18g1r1 iiaa20g1r1 iiaa21g1r1 iiaa22g1r1 and iiaa24g1r1 were identified interestingly iiaa18g1r1 and iiaa20g1r1 were predominant in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity notably iiaa24g1r1 represents a novel previously unrecognized c parvum subtype the subtype iiaa18g1r1 frequently found in this study is strongly implicated in zoonotic transmission these results suggest that calves might be an important source for human cryptosporidiosis in argentina
background toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects a wide variety of warm-blooded hosts including humans limited information about t gondii infection in bats is available in china the objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of t gondii infection in bats in jilin liaoning jiangxi and guangdong provinces china methods during may 2005 to august 2013 bats were sampled from jilin liaoning jiangxi and guangdong provinces china and liver tissues were collected for the detection of t gondii by a nested pcr targeting the b1 gene the positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers sag1 5′-and 3′-sag2 alternative sag2 sag3 btub gra6 l358 pk1 c22-8 c29-2 and apico using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr-rflp results a total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for t gondii infection 38 6.1% were tested positive with by pcr 8 positive dna samples were completely genotyped of which 3 samples 2 from cynopterus sphinx and 1 from murina leucogaster represented toxodb#10 and 5 samples 2 from murina leucogaster 2 from myotis chinensis and 1 from rhinolophus ferrumequinum belonged to toxodb#9 http//toxodb org/toxo/.the present study revealed an overall t gondii prevalence of 6.1% in bats from jilin liaoning jiangxi and guangdong provinces in china and reported two t gondii genotypes toxodb#9 and #10 having a wide geographical distribution in china these results provide new genetic information about t gondii infection in bats and have implications for better understanding of the genetic diversity of t gondii in china and elsewhere
globalization has resulted in enhanced trade in livestock and livestock products leading to increased risk of diseases to livestock and human beings the emergence of highly contagious viral diseases of livestock and poultry such as foot-and-mouth disease peste des petits ruminants african swine fever asf newcastle disease avian influenza and zoonotic diseases caused by viruses like ebola west nile nipah hendra and swine influenza h1n1 have necessitated the formulation of policies and regulatory frameworks for preventing ingress of exotic diseases and controlling dissemination of endemic diseases within the country biosecurity measures are important to maintain and improve animal health and reduce the risks in this review the risks of introduction of infections through livestock and livestock products routes of transmission and general biosecurity measures to reduce these risks have been discussed
11 serology is a core component of the surveillance and management of viral zoonoses virus 12 neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic but requirements for large volumes of 13 serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use here focusing on rabies lyssavirus 14 a globally important zoonosis we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent 15 focus inhibition test pmrffit that overcomes these limitations specifically we adapted an existing 16 micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein-tagged murine leukemia virus 17 pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen 18 detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories we further used statistical analysis to 19 generate rapid quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing 20 antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes using 47 serum samples from 21 domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus 22 neutralization test favn pmrffit showed moderate sensitivity 78.79% and high specificity 23 84.62%. despite small conflicts titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different 24dates both for dog samples r = 0.93 and for a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire 25 bats r = 0.72 n = 41 indicating repeatability our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 µl of serum 26 estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point 27 titration and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species 28the pmrffit enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-29 biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes 30 cannot be obtained 31
in mammals two factors likely to affect the diversity and composition of intestinal bacteria bacterial microbiome and eukaryotes eukaryome are social status and age in species in which social status determines access to resources socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates as high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health the intestinal biome of healthier socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults we tested these predictions on the effect of 1 age juvenile/adult and 2 social status low/high on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena crocuta crocuta a highly social female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources we comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes using a set of 48 different amplicons 4 for bacterial 16s 44 for eukaryote 18s in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach we compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts for all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load in line with our predictions our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals we propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes
the vaccines developed over the first two hundred years since jenner's lifetime have accomplished striking reductions of infection and disease wherever applied pasteur's early approaches to vaccine development attenuation and inactivation are even now the two poles of vaccine technology today purification of microbial elements genetic engineering and improved knowledge of immune protection allow direct creation of attenuated mutants expression of vaccine proteins in live vectors purification and even synthesis of microbial antigens and induction of a variety of immune responses through manipulation of dna rna proteins and polysaccharides both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology the profusion of new vaccines enables new populations to be targeted for vaccination and requires the development of routes of administration additional to injection with all this come new problems in the production regulation and distribution of vaccines
in response to sars-cov infection neutralizing antibodies are generated against the spike s protein determination of the active regions that allow viral escape from neutralization would enable the use of these antibodies for future passive immunotherapy we immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov to generate three anti-s monoclonal antibodies and established several neutralization escape mutants with s protein we identified several amino acid substitutions including y442f and v601g in the s1 domain and d757n and a834v in the s2 region in the presence of each neutralizing antibody double mutants with substitutions in both domains exhibited a greater growth advantage than those with only one substitution importantly combining two monoclonal antibodies that target different epitopes effected almost complete suppression of wild type virus replication thus for effective passive immunotherapy it is important to use neutralizing antibodies that recognize both the s1 and s2 regions
this prospective longitudinal study investigated the epidemiology of enteric disease associated with infections in calves aging up to 70 days a total of 850 fecal samples were collected from 67 calves seventeen isolates of salmonella spp were recovered from feces of 11 calves 16.4 % and statistical analysis revealed no association between the presence of salmonella spp and clinical signs of diarrhea or age virulence factors of escherichia coli were identified in 103 strains eae 7 k99/sta 7 stx1 7 stx1/eae 36 stx1/stx2/eae 2 stx2 43 and stx2/eae 1 there was statistical association between diarrheic animals carrying e coli stx1/eae + in their feces at 2 and 4 weeks of age p= 0.003 and e coli stx2 + at 5 weeks of age p=0.03 rotavirus was detected in 49 5.76 % fecal samples collected from 33 calves 49.2 %. the presence of rotavirus was correlated with diarrheic feces p<0.0001 rather than feces with normal consistency there was a significant relationship between age group and diarrhea p = 0.001 bovine coronavirus bcov was detected in 93 fecal samples collected from 46 calves 68.6 %. there was an association p<0.0001 between diarrheic animals positive for bcov and age groups the results demonstrate the importance of the pathogens studied in the etiology of diarrhea in calves
the coronavirus cov family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness a model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of mers-cov using ai and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins using the percentages of intrinsic disorder pid of the nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins of cov the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the sars-cov m pid = 8% n pid = 50% falling into category b in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials later mers-cov m pid = 9% n pid = 44% was found to be in category c which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution the sars-cov-2 m pid = 6% n pid = 48% has to be placed in category b our data show however that the sars-cov-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell m pid = 6% among coronaviruses this means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body an infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids these particles are also likelier to remain active longer these factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the sars-cov-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread
shiga toxins stx1 and stx2 are the main virulence factors of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec a foodborne pathogen associated with diarrhea hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibodies against stx2 obtained from egg yolks of laying hens immunized with a recombinant stx2b subunit a high specific response in serum was observed 25 days after the first immunization and igy antibodies were extracted from day 47th and purified from egg yolk a concentration of 0.84 mg of total igy/ml of egg yolk was obtained of which 8% were antigen specific the ability of anti-stx2b igy to recognize stx2b and stx2 either in solid-phase or in solution were evaluated and compared with anti-stx2b rabbit antibodies by western blotting and elisa the protective efficacy of igy against stx2 was determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments the results show that igy was able to recognize stx2b and stx2 in denatured conditions attached to a solid-phase and free in solution the anti-stx2b igy could effectively block the biological activity of stx2 on vero cells and protect mice from stx2 challenge the data suggest that immunization of hens with stx2b could be a strategy to obtain at low cost a relatively high concentration of anti-stx2 egg yolk igy able to neutralize stx2 lethal activity igy technology could be an useful tool for research diagnosis and therapy of ehec infection
background in recent years new neonatal porcine diarrhoea nnpd of unknown aetiology has emerged in denmark nnpd affects piglets during the first week of life and results in impaired welfare decreased weight gain and in the worst-case scenario death commonly used preventative interventions such as vaccination or treatment with antibiotics have a limited effect on nnpd previous studies have investigated the clinical manifestations histopathology and to some extent microbiological findings however these studies were either inconclusive or suggested that enterococci possibly in interaction with escherichia coli contribute to the aetiology of nnpd this study examined ileal and colonic luminal contents of 50 control piglets and 52 nnpd piglets by means of the qpcr-based gut microbiotassay and 16 samples by 454 sequencing to study the composition of the bacterial gut microbiota in relation to nnpd results nnpd was associated with a diminished quantity of bacteria from the phyla actinobacteria and firmicutes while genus enterococcus was more than 24 times more abundant in diarrhoeic piglets the number of bacteria from the phylum fusobacteria was also doubled in piglets suffering from diarrhoea with increasing age the gut microbiota of nnpd affected piglet and control piglets became more diverse independent of diarrhoeic status piglets from first parity sows gilts possessed significantly more bacteria from family enterobacteriaceae and species e coli and fewer bacteria from phylum firmicutes piglets born to gilts had 25 times higher odds of having nnpd compared with piglets born to multiparous sows finally the co-occurrence of genus enterococcus and species e coli contributed to the risk of having nnpd the results of this study support previous findings that points towards genus enterococcus and species e coli to be involved in the pathogenesis of nnpd moreover the results indicate that nnpd is associated with a disturbed bacterial composition and larger variation between the diarrhoeic piglets
rabies virus mcp-1 bbb blood-brain barrier vna virus-neutralizing antibody occludin claudin-5 a b s t r a c t rabies virus rabv is a neurotropic virus that causes fatal disease in humans and animals currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear it is believed that once rabv enters the central nervous system cns virus neutralizing antibodies vnas in the periphery cannot pass through the bloodbrain barrier bbb and into the cns furthermore it has been hypothesized that vnas produced in the cns by invading b cells rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the cns are important in clearing rabv from the cns in the present study mouse serum containing vna was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type rabv our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of vnas is crucial in the clearance of rabv from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the bbb permeability remains enhanced this present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing vna therapy for clinical rabies in humans
influenza a viruses infect a remarkably diverse number of hosts two completely new influenza a virus subtypes were recently discovered in bats dramatically expanding the host range of the virus these bat viruses are extremely divergent from all other known strains and likely have unique replication cycles phylogenetic analysis indicates long-term isolated evolution in bats this is supported by a high seroprevalence in sampled bat populations as bats represent ~20% of all classified mammals these findings suggests the presence of a massive cryptic reservoir of poorly characterized influenza a viruses here we review the exciting progress made on understanding these newly discovered viruses and discuss their zoonotic potential
adenoviruses are dna viruses that naturally infect many vertebrates including humans and monkeys and cause a wide range of clinical illnesses in humans infection from individual strains has conventionally been thought to be speciesspecific here we applied the virochip a pan-viral microarray to identify a novel adenovirus tmadv titi monkey adenovirus as the cause of a deadly outbreak in a closed colony of new world monkeys titi monkeys callicebus cupreus at the california national primate research center cnprc among 65 titi monkeys housed in a building 23 34% developed upper respiratory symptoms that progressed to fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis and 19 of 23 monkeys or 83% of those infected died or were humanely euthanized whole-genome sequencing of tmadv revealed that this adenovirus is a new species and highly divergent sharing 57% pairwise nucleotide identity with other adenoviruses cultivation of tmadv was successful in a human a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line but not in primary or established monkey kidney cells at the onset of the outbreak the researcher in closest contact with the monkeys developed an acute respiratory illness with symptoms persisting for 4 weeks and had a convalescent serum sample seropositive for tmadv a clinically ill family member despite having no contact with the cnprc also tested positive and screening of a set of 81 random adult blood donors from the western united states detected tmadv-specific neutralizing antibodies in 2 individuals 2/81 or 2.5%. these findings raise the possibility of zoonotic infection by tmadv and human-to-human transmission of the virus in the population given the unusually high case fatality rate from the outbreak 83% it is unlikely that titi monkeys are the native host species for tmadv and the natural reservoir of the virus is still unknown the discovery of tmadv a novel adenovirus with the capacity to infect both monkeys and humans suggests that adenoviruses should be monitored closely as potential causes of cross-species outbreaks
the use of small animal models for the study of infectious disease is critical for understanding disease progression and for developing prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options for many diseases syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost small size ease of handling and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology this becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed here we discuss the progress of this development with focus on classical methods used as well as more recent molecular methods we outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters this will provide valuable information to researchers who are deciding whether to use hamsters as an animal model syrian hamster • golden hamster • syrian golden hamster • immunological tools • molecular methods • mesocricetus auratus • animal models
middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a deadly viral respiratory disease caused by mers-coronavirus mers-cov infection to date there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease in addition no vaccine has been licensed to prevent mers-cov infection thus far therefore our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective mers vaccine overall vaccine candidates against mers-cov are mainly based upon the viral spike s protein due to its vital role in the viral infectivity although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid n protein envelope e protein and nonstructural protein 16 nsp16 have also been reported in general the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types viral vector-based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine nanoparticle-based vaccine inactivated-whole virus vaccine and liveattenuated vaccine which are discussed in detail besides the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of mers-cov infection are extensively reviewed in addition animal models used to study mers-cov and evaluate the vaccine candidates are discussed intensively

bats are reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses that can have a profound impact on human and animal health including lyssaviruses filoviruses paramyxoviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-covs in the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in contexts where human-bat contact might facilitate more efficient interspecies transmission of viruses we surveyed gastrointestinal tissue obtained from bats collected in caves in nigeria that are frequented by humans et al 2010 identification of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in a leaf-nosed bat in nigeria mbio 14coronavirus consensus pcr and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing revealed the presence of coronavirus sequences related to those of sars-cov in a commerson's leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni additional genomic sequencing indicated that this virus unlike subgroup 2b covs which includes sars-cov is unique comprising three overlapping open reading frames between the m and n genes and two conserved stem-loop ii motifs phylogenetic analyses in conjunction with these features suggest that this virus represents a new subgroup within group 2 covs importance bats order chiroptera suborders megachiroptera and microchiroptera are reservoirs for a wide range of viruses that cause diseases in humans and livestock including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov responsible for the global sars outbreak in 2003 the diversity of viruses harbored by bats is only just beginning to be understood because of expanded wildlife surveillance and the development and application of new tools for pathogen discovery this paper describes a new coronavirus one with a distinctive genomic organization that may provide insights into coronavirus evolution and biology
rna viruses are capable of rapid spread and severe or potentially lethal disease in both animals and humans the development of reverse genetics systems for manipulation and study of rna virus genomes has provided platforms for designing and optimizing viral mutants for vaccine development here we review the impact of rna virus reverse genetics systems on past and current efforts to design effective and safe viral therapeutics and vaccines
background given that there is a possibility of a human h5n1 pandemic and the fact that the recent h5n1 viruses are resistant to the anti-viral drugs newer strategies for effective therapy are warranted previous studies show that single mabs in immune prophylaxis can be protective against h5n1 infection but a single mab may not be effective in neutralization of a broad range of different strains of h5n1 and control of potential neutralization escape mutants methods/principal findings we selected two mabs which recognized different epitopes on the hemagglutinin molecule these two mabs could each neutralize in vitro escape mutants to the other and in combination could effectively neutralize viruses from clades 0 1 2.1 2.2 2.3 4 7 and 8 of influenza a h5n1 viruses this combination of chimeric mabs when administered passively pre or post challenge with 10 mld50 50% mouse lethal dose hpai h5n1 influenza a viruses could protect 100% of the mice from two different clades of viruses clades 1 and 2.1 we also tested the efficacy of a single dose of the combination of mabs versus two doses two doses of the combination therapy not only affected early clearance of the virus from the lung but could completely prevent lung pathology of the h5n1 infected mice no escape variants were detected after therapy conclusions/significance our studies provide proof of concept that the synergistic action of two or more mabs in combination is required for preventing the generation of escape mutants and also to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of passive therapy against h5n1 infection combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of antibody to be administered for passive therapy of influenza infection and hence can be made available at reduced economic costs during an outbreak
the majority of human emerging infectious diseases eids are zoonotic with viruses originating in wild mammals of particular concern e g hiv ebola sars 1-3 . understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission or spillover are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . however few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian hostvirus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable after controlling for research effort the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans host taxonomy and human population within a species range -which may reflect human-wildlife contact we demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders we identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance we then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security and have caused the majority of recent pandemics in people 4 yet our understanding of the factors driving viral diversity in mammals viral host range and cross-species transmission to humans remain nascent recent studies have described broad patterns of pathogen host range 13 and various host or microbial factors that facilitate cross-species transmission 578 or have focused on users may view print copy and download text and data-mine the content in such documents for the purposes of academic research subject always to the full conditions of use http//www nature all datasets host traits viral traits full list of host-virus associations and associated references phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic distance matrices along with the r code and r package dependencies needed to fully replicate and evaluate these analyses are provided at http//doi org/10.5281/zenodo.569079 the top-level readme txt file in the directory details the file structure and metadata provided
the complex relationships between the human and animal species have never ceased to evolve since the emergence of the human species and have resulted in a human-animal interface that has promoted the cross-species transmission emergence and eventual evolution of a plethora of infectious pathogens remarkably most of the characteristics of the human-animal interface-as we know it today-have been established long before the end of our species prehistorical development took place to be relentlessly shaped throughout the history of our species more recently changes affecting the modern human population worldwide as well as their dramatic impact on the global environment have taken domestication agriculture urbanization industrialization and colonization to unprecedented levels this has created a unique global multi-faceted humananimal interface associated with a major epidemiological transition that is accompanied by an unexpected rise of new and emerging infectious diseases importantly these developments are largely paralleled by medical technological and scientific progress continuously spurred by our never-ending combat against pathogens the human-animal interface has most likely contributed significantly to the evolutionary shaping and historical development of our species investment in a better understanding of this human-animal interface will offer humankind a future head-start in the never-ending battle against infectious diseases

epstein-barr virus ebv was the first human tumor virus being discovered and remains to date the only human pathogen that can transform cells in vitro 55 years of ebv research have now brought us to the brink of an ebv vaccine for this purpose recombinant viral vectors and their heterologous prime-boost vaccinations ebv-derived virus-like particles and viral envelope glycoprotein formulations are explored and are discussed in this review even so cell-mediated immune control by cytotoxic lymphocytes protects healthy virus carriers from ebv-associated malignancies antibodies might be able to prevent symptomatic primary infection the most likely ebv-associated pathology against which ebv vaccines will be initially tested thus the variety of ebv vaccines reflects the sophisticated life cycle of this human tumor virus and only vaccination in humans will finally be able to reveal the efficacy of these candidates nevertheless the recently renewed efforts to develop an ebv vaccine and the long history of safe adoptive t cell transfer to treat ebv-associated malignancies suggest that this oncogenic γ-herpesvirus can be targeted by immunotherapies such vaccination should ideally implement the very same immune control that protects healthy ebv carriers
segmented filamentous bacteria sfb are a group of host-adapted commensal organisms that attach to the ileal epithelium of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts a genetic relative of the genus clostridium these morphologically unique bacteria display a replication and differentiation lifecycle initiated by epithelial tissue binding and filamentation sfb intimately bind to the surface of absorptive intestinal epithelium without inducing an inflammatory response rather their presence impacts the generation of innate and differentiation of acquired immunity which impact the clearance of extracellular bacterial or fungal pathogens in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts sfb have recently garnered attention due to their role in promoting adaptive and innate immunity in mice and rats through the differentiation and maturation of th17 cells in the intestinal tract and production of immunoglobulin a iga sfb are the first commensal bacteria identified that impact the maturation and development of th17 cells in mice recently microbiome studies have revealed the presence of candidatus arthromitus occasionally designated as candidatus savagella a proposed candidate species of sfb in higher proportions in higher-performing flocks as compared to matched lowerperforming flocks suggesting that sfb may serve to establish a healthy gut and protect commercial turkeys from pathogens resulting in morbidity and decreased performance in this review we seek to describe the life cycle host specificity and genetic capabilities of sfb such as bacterial metabolism and how these factors influence the host immunity and microbiome although the role of sfb to induce antigen-specific th17 cells in poultry is unknown they may play an important role in modulating the immune response in the intestinal tract to promote resistance against some infectious diseases and promote food-safety this review demonstrates the importance of studying and further characterizing commensal host-specific bacteria in food-producing animals and their importance to animal health
while direct contact may sometimes be sufficient to allow a pathogen to jump into a new host species in other cases fortuitously adaptive mutations that arise in the original donor host are also necessary viruses have been the focus of most host shift studies so less is known about the importance of ecological versus evolutionary processes to successful bacterial host shifts here we tested whether direct contact with the novel host was sufficient to enable the mid-1990s jump of the bacterium mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to house finches haemorhous mexicanus we experimentally inoculated house finches with two genetically distinct m gallisepticum strains obtained either from poultry rlow or from house finches hf1995 during an epizootic outbreak all 15 house finches inoculated with hf1995 became infected whereas rlow successfully infected 12 of 15 80% inoculated house finches comparisons among infected birds showed that relative to hf1995 rlow achieved substantially lower bacterial loads in the host respiratory mucosa and was cleared faster furthermore rlow-infected finches were less likely to develop clinical symptoms than hf1995-infected birds and when they did displayed milder conjunctivitis the lower infection success of rlow relative to hf1995 was not however due to a heightened host antibody response to rlow taken together our results indicate that contact between infected poultry and house finches was not by itself sufficient to explain the jump of m gallisepticum to house finches instead mutations arising in the original poultry host would have been necessary for successful pathogen emergence in the novel finch host
the swedish moose was analysed for genetic variability at major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and class i1 dqa dqb and drb loci using restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp and single strand conformation polymorphism sscp techniques both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism since the sscp analysis concerned an expressed drb gene it can be concluded that the level of functional mhc class i1 polymorphism at least at the drb locus is low in swedish moose dna fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low mhc variability could be explained by a low degree of genome-wide genetic diversity hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population but the data suggest that the low mhc variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck however since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than mhc sequences the low levels of mhc diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin the selection pressure for mhc variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population genetic variability and differentiation of large grazing mammals journal of marnmalogy 64109-120 bodmer wf 1972 evolutionary significance of the hla-system nature 237 139-145 brown jh jardetzky t gorga jc stem lj urban rg strominger jl wdey dc 1988 three-dimensional structure of the human dass ii histocompatibility complex antigen hla-drl nature 364.33-39 darden ag streilein jw 1984 syrian hamsters express two monomorphic class i major histocompatibility complex molecules immunogenetics 20.603-622 doherty pc zinkernagel rm 1975 a biological role for major histocompatibility antigens lancet i 1406-1409 ellegren h andersson l wallin k 1991 dna polymorphism in the moose a alces revealed by the polynucleotide probe tcn journal of heredity 82429-431 ellegren h . harhnan g johansson m andersson l 1993 major histocompatibility complex monomorphism and low levels of dna fingerprinting variability in a reintroduced and rapidly expanding population of beavers proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the usa 90.8150-8153 georges m lequaree as catelli m hanset r vassart g 1988 dna fingerprinting i n domestic animals using four different minisatellite probes cytogenetics mid cell genetics 47 127-131 pa rask l 1984 mutations and selection in the generation of class i1 histocompatibility antigen polymorphism
human rotaviruses represent a major cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children the limited impact of oral vaccines on global estimates of rotavirus mortality and the suboptimal use of oral rehydration justify the need for alternative prophylactic and therapeutic strategies especially for immunocompromised hosts the protective effects of colostrum-the first milk produced during the initial 24 to 48 h after parturition-are well documented in the literature in particular the ingestion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum has been proposed as an alternative preventive approach against human rotavirus gastroenteritis although the immunization of pregnant cows with human rotavirus boosts the release of specific immunoglobulin g in bovine colostrum it raises regulatory and safety issues in this study we demonstrated that the conventional bovine rotavirus vaccine is sufficient to enhance the anti-human rotavirus protective efficacy of bovine colostrum thus providing a conservative approach to produce hyperimmune bovine colostrum making it exploitable as a functional food

background in a previous study it was demonstrated that high replication of porcine circovirus 2 pcv2 in a gnotobiotic pig was correlated with the absence of pcv2-neutralizing antibodies the aim of the present study was to investigate if this correlation could also be found in spf pigs in which pmws was experimentally reproduced and in naturally pmws-affected pigs results when looking at the total anti-pcv2 antibody titres pmws-affected and healthy animals seroconverted at the same time point and titres in pmws-affected animals were only slightly lower compared to those in healthy animals in healthy animals the evolution of pcv2-neutralizing antibodies coincided with that of total antibodies in pmws-affected animals neutralizing antibodies could either not be found sera from field studies or were detected in low titres between 7 and 14 dpi only sera from experimentally inoculated spf pigs differences were also found in the evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres against pcv2 in healthy pigs igm antibodies persisted until the end of the study whereas in pmws-affected pigs they quickly decreased or remained present at low titres the mean titres of other antibody isotypes igg1 igg2 and iga were slightly lower in pmws-affected pigs compared to their healthy group mates at the end of each study this study describes important differences in the development of the humoral immune response between pigs that get subclinically infected with pcv2 and pigs that experience a high level of pcv2-replication which in 3 of 4 experiments led to the development of pmws these observations may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of a pcv2infection

a review of the literature reveals that ozone 03 exposure can either suppress or enhance immune responsiveness these disparate effects elicited by 0 exposure depend in large part on the experimental design used the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied despite the apparent contradictions a general pattern of response to 03 exposure can be recognized most studies indicate that continuous 03 exposure leads to an early days 0-3 impairment of immune responsiveness followed with continued exposures by a form of adaptation to 03 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response the effects of 03 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which 03 exposure occurred whereas 03 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen 03 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that 03 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity -environ health perspect 1 03suppl 2 77-89 1995

bovine viral diarrhea viruses bvdv have significant impact on beef and dairy production worldwide the infections are widespread in the cattle populations and in many production systems vaccinations are utilized bvdv strains have the hallmark of adversely affecting the immune system's many components both the innate and acquired systems while bvdv do cause primary infections and disease their role in the pathogenesis of other agents underscores the complexity of viralebacterial synergy a greater understanding of the role of the persistently infected pi animal resulting from susceptible females infected at a critical stage of pregnancy has permitted acknowledgment of a major source of infection to susceptible animals not only do we understand the role of the pi in transmitting infections and complicating other infections but we now focus attempts to better diagnose and remove the pi animal vaccinations now address the need to have an immune population especially the breeding females in the herd biosecurity detection and removal of the pi and effective vaccinations are tools for potential successful bvdv control
monoclonal antibodies mabs are among the fastest-growing therapeutics and are being developed for a broad range of indications including the neutralization of toxins bacteria and viruses nevertheless mabs potency is still relatively low when compared to conventional polyclonal ab preparations moreover the efficacy of an individual neutralizing mab may significantly be hampered by the potential absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent these limitations of individual neutralizing mabs can be overcome by using oligoclonal combinations of several mabs with different specificities to the target antigen studies conducted in our lab and by others show that such combined mab preparation may present substantial synergy in its potency over the calculated additive potency of its individual mab components moreover oligoclonal preparation is expected to be better suited to compensating for reduced efficacy due to epitope variation in this review the synergistic neutralization properties of combined oligoclonal ab preparations are described the effect of ab affinity autologous fc fraction and targeting a critical number of epitopes as well as the unexpected contribution of non-neutralizing clones to the synergistic neutralizing effect are presented and discussed

shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum despite of extensive research during the last two decades a vaccine against multi-drug resistant shigella is not yet available in the market to provide a safe effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against shigella we explored food grade bacteria lactococcus lactis l lactis for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein outer membrane protein a ompa to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity we have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant l lactis expressing ompa lacvax ò ompa in balb/c mice in the present study we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of lacvax ò ompa and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model the significant increase in ompa specific serum igg fecal siga and a th1 dominant immune response indicated by high inf-c/il-4 ratio in lacvax ò ompa immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity the lacvax ò ompa immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with s flexneri 2a atcc 12022 the antigen specific serum igg fecal siga inf-c and il-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection collectively these results suggest that the lacvax ò ompa is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis however the protective efficacy of lacvax ò ompa in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans
the zoonotic transmission of sars coronavirus from animals to humans revealed the potential impact of coronaviruses on mankind this incident also triggered several surveillance programs to hunt for novel coronaviruses in human and wildlife populations using classical rt-pcr assays that target a highly conserved sequence among coronaviruses we identified the first coronaviruses in bats these assays and the cloning and sequencing of the pcr products are described in this chapter using the same approach in our subsequent studies we further detected several novel coronaviruses in bats these findings highlighted the fact that bats are important reservoirs for coronaviruses
background the aim of this study was to investigate whether the syndrome new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome nnpds is associated with a viral aetiology four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea and suspected to be affected by nnpds were included in a case-control set up a total of 989 piglets were clinically examined on a daily basis samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were selected for extensive virological examination using specific real time polymerase chain reactions qpcrs and general virus detection methods results a total of 91.7% of the animals tested positive by reverse transcription qpcr rt-qpcr for porcine kobuvirus 1 pkv-1 while 9% and 3% were found to be positive for rotavirus a and porcine teschovirus ptv respectively the overall prevalence of porcine astrovirus pastv was 75% with 69.8% of the pastv positive pigs infected with pastv type 3 no animals tested positive for rotavirus c coronavirus tgev pedv and prcv sapovirus enterovirus parechovirus saffoldvirus cosavirus klassevirus or porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 microarray analyses performed on a total of 18 animals were all negative as were eight animals examined by transmission electron microscopy tem using next generation de novo sequencing de novo ngs on pools of samples from case animals within all herds pkv-1 was detected in four herds and rotavirus a rotavirus c and ptv were detected in one herd each conclusions our detailed analyses of piglets from nnpds-affected herds demonstrated that viruses did not pose a significant contribution to nnpds however further investigations are needed to investigate if a systemic virus infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of nnpds
giardia and cryptosporidium are common enteric parasites of domestic animals particularly dogs cats and livestock their occurrence is of potential significance from both clinical and public health perspectives yet until recently confusion over the taxonomy of these organisms prevented a clear understanding of the epidemiology of infections with both giardia and cryptosporidium the recent application of molecular epidemiological tools has helped to resolve taxonomic issues allowing cycles of transmission to be determined in addition advances have been made in elucidating mechanisms associated with pathogenesis whereas only limited progress has been achieved in the areas of chemotherapy and prophylaxis
a japanese man suffered from acute respiratory tract infection after returning to japan from bali indonesia in 2007 miyazaki-bali/2007 a strain of the species of nelson bay orthoreovirus was isolated from the patient's throat swab using vero cells in which syncytium formation was observed this is the sixth report describing a patient with respiratory tract infection caused by an orthoreovirus classified to the species of nelson bay orthoreovirus given the possibility that all of the patients were infected in malaysia and indonesia prospective surveillance on orthoreovirus infections should be carried out in southeast asia furthermore contact surveillance study suggests that the risk of human-to-human infection of the species of nelson bay orthoreovirus would seem to be low
coronaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that infect mammals and birds bats are reservoirs for several different coronaviruses in the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genera they also appear to be the natural reservoir for the ancestral viruses that generated the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks here we detected coronavirus sequences in next-generation sequence data created from eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine we also screened by pcr urine samples faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in singapore between 2011 and 2014 all of which were negative the phylogenetic analysis indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage d betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species this is the second time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats but the first coronavirus sequence data generated from this species bat species from which this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across se asia south asia and southern china they overlap geographically often share roosting sites and have been witnessed to forage on the same plant the addition of sequence data from this group of viruses will allow us to better understand coronavirus evolution and host specificity
covering sites perceived to have medium to high level bat-human interaction the objective of this surveillance study was to apply a non-invasive approach using fresh feces to detect viruses circulating within the diverse species of kenyan bats we screened for both dna and rna viruses specifically astroviruses astvs adenoviruses advs caliciviruses calvs coronaviruses covs flaviviruses filoviruses paramyxoviruses pmvs polyomaviruses pyvs and rotaviruses we used family-specific primers amplicon sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis except for filoviruses eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and positive rates across the five regions former provinces studied astvs 12.83% covs 3.97% pmv 2.4% adv 2.26% pyv 1.65% calvs 0.29% rotavirus 0.19% and flavivirus 0 rotavirus a rva strains detected were highly related to human strains with vp6 genotypes i2 and i16 genotype i16 has previously been assigned to human rva-strain b10 from kenya only which raises public health concern particularly considering increased human-bat interaction additionally 229e-like bat covs were detected in samples originating from hipposideros bats roosting in sites with high human activity our findings confirm the presence of diverse viruses in kenyan bats while providing extended knowledge on bat virus distribution the detection of viruses highly related to human strains and hence of public health concern underscores the importance of continuous surveillance
coronavirus hku15 is a deltacoronavirus that was discovered in fecal samples of pigs in hong kong in 2012 over the past three years coronavirus hku15 has been widely detected in pigs in east/southeast asia and north america and has been associated with fatal outbreaks in all such epidemiological studies the virus was generally only detected in fecal/intestinal samples in this molecular epidemiology study we detected coronavirus hku15 in 9.6% of the nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 249 pigs in hong kong samples that tested positive were mostly collected during winter complete genome sequencing of the coronavirus hku15 in two nasopharyngeal samples revealed quasispecies in one of the samples two of the polymorphic sites involved indels but the other two involved transition substitutions phylogenetic analysis showed that the two nasopharyngeal strains in the present study were most closely related to the strains pdcov/chjxni2/2015 from jiangxi china and ch/sichuan/s27/2012 from sichuan china the outbreak strains in the united states possessed highly similar genome sequences and were clustered monophyletically whereas the asian strains were more diverse and paraphyletic the detection of coronavirus hku15 in respiratory tracts of pigs implies that in addition to enteric infections coronavirus hku15 may be able to cause respiratory infections in pigs and that in addition to fecal-oral transmission the virus could possibly spread through the respiratory route the presence of the virus in respiratory samples provides an alternative clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of coronavirus hku15 infection quasispecies were unprecedentedly observed in the 5′-untranslated region of coronavirus genomes
background porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws causing large economical losses of the global swine industry nitric oxide no as an important signaling molecule has antiviral activity on some viruses to date there is little information on the role of no during pcv2 infection results we used indirect fluorescence assay ifa tcid 50 real-time rt-qpcr and western blot assay to reveal the role of no in restricting pcv2 replication pcv2 replication was inhibited by a form of no no • whereas pcv2 was not susceptible to another form of no no + . conclusion our findings indicate that the form of no • has a potential role in the fight against pcv2 infection
in ostriches the population densities resulting from intensive rearing increases susceptibility to pathogens such as mycoplasmas in addition to good management practices vaccination offers an attractive alternative for controlling mycoplasma infections in food animals instead of using antibiotics which often leave unacceptable residues the use of live attenuated vaccines however carry the concern of reversion to virulence or genetic recombination with field strains currently there are no commercially available vaccines against ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas and this study therefore set out to develop and evaluate the use of a dna vaccine against mycoplasma infections in ostriches using an oppa protein as antigen to this end the oppa gene of "mycoplasma nasistruthionis sp nov." str ms03 was cloned into two dna vaccine expression vectors after codon correction by site-directed mutagenesis three-months-old ostriches were then vaccinated intramuscularly at different doses followed by a booster vaccination after 6 weeks the ability of the dna vaccines to elicit an anti-oppa antibody response was evaluated by elisa using the recombinant oppa protein of ms03 as coating antigen a statistically significant anti-oppa antibody response could be detected after administration of a booster vaccination indicating that the oppa protein was successfully immunogenic the responses were also both dose and vector dependent in conclusion the dna vaccines were able to elicit an immune response in ostriches and can therefore be viewed as an option for the development of vaccines against mycoplasma infections
canine parvovirus cpv is the etiological agent of a severe viral disease of dogs after its emergence in late 1970s the cpv original type cpv-2 was rapidly and totally replaced by three antigenic variants named cpv-2a cpv-2b and cpv-2c cpv has an evolutionary rate nearest to those of rna viruses with consequences on disease diagnosis and epidemiology this paper reports the molecular characterization of eight cpv-2a strains collected from dogs in italy in 2016-2017 genetic analysis was conducted on a cpv genomic region encompassing both open reading frames orfs encoding for nonstructural ns1-ns2 and structural proteins vp1-vp2 sequence analysis indicates new and unreported sequence changes mainly affecting the vp2 gene which included the mutation tyr324leu this study represents the first evidence of a new cpv-2a mutant vp2 324leu and illustrates the importance of a continuous molecular survey in order to obtain more information on effective spread of new cpv mutants
we determined the untranslated 5 -leader sequence for three different isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv pathogenic european-and american-types as well as an american-type vaccine strain 5 -leader from european-and american-type prrsv differed in length 220 and 190 nt respectively and exhibited only approximately 50% nucleotide homology nevertheless highly conserved areas were identified in the leader of all 3 prrsv isolates which constitute candidate motifs for binding of proteins involved in viral replication these comparative data provide a priori knowledge for mutational identification of virulence determinants in the 5 nontranslated part of the prrsv genome
enteric viral infections in pigs may cause diarrhea resulting in ill-thrift and substantial economic losses this study reports the enteric infections with porcine astrovirus type 4 pastv4 porcine group a rotavirus garv porcine group c rotavirus gcrv porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 and porcine kobuvirus pkov in 419 pigs comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals from 49 farms in five european countries austria germany hungary spain and sweden real-time rt-pcr assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status farms of origin and age groups the results showed that pastv4 70.4% was the dominant virus species followed by pkov 56.7% pcv2 42.2% gcrv 3% and garv 0.9%. diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of pastv4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs whereas pcv2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs suggesting that most pcv2 infections were subclinical pastv4 pcv2 and pkov were considered ubiquitous in the european pig livestock and co-infections among them were frequent independently of the disease status in contrast to a low prevalence of classical rotavirus infections
bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity although several of these viruses are zoonotic the majority are not astroviruses transmitted fecal-orally are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans these features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history epidemiology in the host and temporal shedding trends our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in singapore reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection of the seven species screened astroviruses were detected in rhinolophus lepidus and eonycteris spelaea the r lepidus sequences grouped with other rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from china and laos while the eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from rousettus spp in laos and pteropus giganteus in bangladesh but not with other e spelaea sequences longitudinal collections of eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses this study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats it also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness host ecology such as roosting behavior may drive co-infections virus maintenance and spillover
feline infectious peritonitis fip is the most feared infectious cause of death in cats induced by feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv this coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus fecv to date feline coronavirus fcov research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype i fcovs in this study long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 sv40 t-antigen-and human telomerase reverse transcriptase htert-induced immortalization subsequently these cultures were evaluated for their usability in fcov research firstly the replication capacity of the serotype ii strains wsu 79-1683 and wsu 79-1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures in accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures fcov wsu 79-1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to fcov wsu 79-1146 in both continuous cultures in addition the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from fip cats the cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype i enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated no infection was seen in cultures inoculated with fipv tissue homogenates in conclusion a new reliable model for fcov investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established in contrast to fipv strains fecvs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells giving an explanation for the observation that fecv is the main pathotype circulating among cats
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov nucleocapsid protein np is one of the predominant antigenic protein and the most abundant shed antigen throughout the sars-cov infection this feature makes it a suitable molecular target for diagnostic applications in this study the full length codon optimized np gene and its subfragment gene segment was cloned in a bacterial expression vector the full length np could be expressed in e coli at very high level within inclusion bodies the inclusion bodies were successfully solubilized purified under denaturing conditions employing imac column and refolded the non-glycosylated np was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development the polyclonal antiserum from animals immunized with this recombinant np protein was found to specifically recognize the np and its subfragments thus demonstrating the immunogenic nature of the recombinant protein the np antigen or a subfragment could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic assay to monitor sars-cov outbreaks by detecting the early human anti-sars antibodies in addition the availability of the np fragments could facilitate epitope mapping of anti-np monoclonals for identifying suitable sandwich pairs
trichomonads have been infrequently reported in the feces of dogs where their pathogenicity remains uncertain it is currently unknown whether tritrichomonas foetus or pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents the objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for t foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction pcr testing between 2007 and 2010 we also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time pcr panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens p hominis t foetus or both were identified by pcr in feces of 17 1 and 1 dogs respectively feces from the remaining 19 dogs were pcr negative for t foetus p hominis and using broader-spectrum trichomonadida primers the total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by pcr as infected with trichomonads these results suggest that p hominis infection is more frequently identified than t foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population
i nfectious diseases still represent a major challenge to human progress and survival especially elderly persons are more frequently and severely affected by infectious diseases and they display distinct features with respect to clinical presentation and treatment although vaccinations are considered a vital medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases the protective effect ofvaccinations is abrogated in elderly persons this is due to a decline in the functions of the immune system referred to as immunosenescence the first part of this chapter will therefore summarize the status quo ofthe efficacy ofvaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by typical infectious diseases in the elderly such as influenza pneumonia and tuberculosis the second part willthen elucidate the underlying age-related mechanisms which may contribute to the decreased efficacy ofvaccines based on the complex mechanisms involved in immunosenescence strategies willbe outlined which may be successful in enhancingprotective immune responses following vaccination in elderly persons
human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 is primarily associated with common cold in children elderly and immunocompromised individuals outbreaks caused by hcov-nl63 are rare here we report a cluster of hcov-nl63 cases with severe lower respiratory tract infection that arose in guangzhou china in 2018 twenty-three hospitalized children were confirmed to be hcov-nl63 positive and most of whom were hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute bronchitis whole genomes of hcov-nl63 were obtained using next-generation sequencing phylogenetic and single amino acid polymorphism analyses showed that this outbreak was associated with two subgenotypes c3 and b of hcov-nl63 half of patients were identified to be related to a new subgenotype c3 one unique amino acid mutation at i507 l in spike protein receptor binding domain rbd was detected which segregated this subgenotype c3 from other known subgenotypes pseudotyped virus bearing the i507 l mutation in rbd showed enhanced entry into host cells as compared to the prototype virus this study proved that hcov-nl63 was undergoing continuous mutation and has the potential to cause severe lower respiratory disease in humans this study reports an outbreak of severe lower respiratory illness caused by two subgenotypes c3 and b of human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 the new subgenotype c3 with enhanced viral entry into host cells accounts for half of patients which alerted that hcov-nl63 which consist of multiple subgenotypes is undergoing continuous mutation and has the potential to cause large-scale severe infections in humans

infectious bronchitis virus ibv as an avian coronavirus is still posing a persistent and imminent threat to the poultry industry worldwide here we report that transfection of sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding m and s proteins resulted in the assembly of ibv vlps this is the first report that s protein plus m protein alone were able to be assembled into vlps for coronaviruses we further showed that the generated ibv vlps could induce humoral immune responses in a level comparable to that of inactivated ibv vaccine and more importantly the ibv vlps could elicit significantly higher cellular immune responses than the inactivated ibv vaccine in summary the assembly of ibv vlps with m and s proteins provided a simple strategy for generating vlps for coronaviruses and the generated ibv vlps laid a feasible foundation for the development of an effective vaccine against infection of ibv in the future
host antiviral genes are important regulators of antiviral immunity and plausible genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity after vaccination we genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagsnps from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella mmr vaccine associations between snps/haplotypes and measles virusspecific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in caucasians and african-americans genetic variants within the ddx58/rig-i gene including a coding polymorphism rs3205166/val800val were associated as single-snps p ≤ 0.017 although these snps did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/fdr and in haplotype-level analysis with measles-specific antibody variations in caucasians haplotype allele p-value = 0.021 haplotype global p-value = 0.076 four ddx58 polymorphisms in high ld demonstrated also associations after correction for fdr with variations in both measles-specific ifn-␥ and il-2 secretion in caucasians p ≤ 0.001 q = 0.193 two intronic oas1 polymorphisms including the functional oas1 snp rs10774671 p = 0.003 demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in african-americans genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of adar genetic variants including a non-synonymous snp rs2229857/arg384lys p = 0.01 in regulating measles virus-specific ifn-␥ elispot responses in caucasians haplotype global p-value = 0.017 after correction for fdr 15 single-snp associations 11 snps in caucasians and 4 snps in african-americans still remained significant at the q-value < 0.20 in conclusion our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control as critical determinants differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in caucasians and african-americans
we previously described that immunopotentiators cvcva5 increased the efficacy of h5 and h9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens ducks and geese in this study we further investigated the effects of the cvcva5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines the immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus cvcva5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and cytokines of ifnγ and il-4 from serum vaccines included the univalent vaccine of newcastle disease virus nd egg drop syndrome virus eds infectious bronchitis virus ib and infectious bursal disease virus ibd the cvcva5 also improved the immune response of both nd and ibd vaccines with less dosage the sterile protective immunity was monitored with one-or a half-dose of adjuvanted nd vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted ibd vaccine respectively the improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without cvcva5 as measured by the antibody levels including bivalent vaccine of nd-h9 nd-ib and nd-ibd the cvcva5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine nd-ib-eds-h9 a half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75% antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines the cvcva5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against h5 or h9 virus antigens in which chickens primed with the adjuvanted nd-ib vaccines given a booster with h5-h9 bivalent vaccines without cvcva5 using 5-day intervals the inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of ifnγ and il-4 after the injection of the adjuvanted nd-ib vaccines results indicated that the cvcva5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines this has a potential as an improve vaccine
a high proportion of dogs suffer from respiratory disease when they are placed in kennels for vacation or re-homing the role of mycoplasma cynos as an initiating agent in canine infectious respiratory disease was investigated by examining the serological response of dogs to this organism at the time of entry into a large re-homing kennel forty-two paired serum samples from dogs 21-day interval were examined for antibody to m cynos using western blotting the development of antibody in the serum was related to clinical disease recorded over the same period sixty seven per cent of the dogs showed a two-fold or greater rise in antibody to m cynos during the first 3 weeks in the kennel reactivity with a 45 kda antigen was dominant of those showing a positive serological reaction 80% had recorded clinical respiratory disease while 20% remained healthy the findings of this study show that an antibody response to m cynos is common in dogs entering the re-homing kennel and is positively related to the development of clinical respiratory disease #

viral pathogens account for a significant proportion of the burden of emerging infectious diseases in humans the wellcome trust-vietnamese initiative on zoonotic infections wt-vizions is aiming to understand the circulation of viral zoonotic pathogens in animals that pose a potential risk to human health evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis e virus hev genotypes gt 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission hypothesising that hev gt3 and gt4 are circulating in the vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of hev exposure in a population of farmers and the general population we additionally performed sequence analysis of hev in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding hev circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of hev exposure we found a high prevalence of hev gt3 viral rna in pigs 19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs and a high hev seroprevalence in pig farmers 16.0% and a hospital-attending population 31.7% in southern vietnam the hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias the detection of hev rna in pigs indicates that hev may be a zoonotic disease risk in this location although a larger sample size is required to infer an association between hev positivity in pigs and seroprevalence in humans
background severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged in china in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the sars coronavirus vaccine development was initiated evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a viruslike-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologictype lung disease design four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of sars a vlp vaccine the vaccine given to ferrets and nhp another whole virus vaccine and an rdna-produced s protein balb/c or c57bl/6 mice were vaccinated im on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56 on day 58 challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology results all vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses significant reductions of sars-cov two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live sars-cov all mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated balb/c and c57bl/6 or given live virus influenza vaccine or pbs suggesting infection occurred in all histopathology seen in animals given one of the sars-cov vaccines was uniformly a th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration confirmed with special eosinophil stains the pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence conclusions these sars-cov vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with sars-cov however challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to sars-cov components was induced caution in proceeding to application of a sars-cov vaccine in humans is indicated
the protective efficacy of dna plasmids encoding avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv s1 n or m protein was investigated in chickens chickens were inoculated monovalently with plasmid pvax1-16s1 pvax1-16m or pvax1-16n alone or multivalently combination of the three different plasmids pvax1-16s1/m/n a prime-boost immunization protocol against ibv was developed chickens were immunized with the multivalent dna vaccine twice and then boosted with an inactivated vaccine once antibody titers of the chickens immunized with pvax1-16s1/m/n were much higher than those of the monovalent groups p ＜ 0.01 a protective rate up to 90% was observed in the pvax1-16s1/m/n group the serum antibody titers in the prime-boost birds were significantly higher than those of the multivalent dna vaccine group p ＜ 0.01 but not significantly different compared to the inactivated vaccine group at 49 days of age additionally the prime-boost group also showed the highest level of ibv-specific cellular proliferation compared to the monovalent groups p ＜ 0.01 but no significant difference was found compared to the multivalent dna vaccine group and the prime-boost group completely protected from followed viral challenge
background recent and previous studies have shown that guinea pigs can be infected with and transmit human influenza viruses therefore guinea pig may be a useful animal model for better understanding influenza infection and assessing vaccine strategies to more fully characterize the model antibody responses following either infection/re-infection with human influenza a/wyoming/03/2003 h3n2 or immunization with its homologous recombinant hemagglutinin ha protein were studied results serological samples were collected and tested for anti-ha immunoglobulin by elisa antiviral antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition hi and recognition of linear epitopes by peptide scanning pepscan animals inoculated with infectious virus demonstrated pronounced viral replication and subsequent serological conversion animals either immunized with the homologous ha antigen or infected showed a relatively rapid rise in antibody titers to the ha glycoprotein in elisa assays antiviral antibodies measured by hi assay were detectable after the second inoculation pepscan data identified both previously recognized and newly defined linear epitopes conclusions infection and/or recombinant ha immunization of guinea pigs with h3n2 wyoming influenza virus resulted in a relatively rapid production of viral-specific antibody thus demonstrating the strong immunogenicity of the major viral structural proteins in this animal model for influenza infection the sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model of influenza infection and immunization
bats a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents of significance to human and animal health in the present study we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families in particular from flying foxes pteropodidae eidolon helvum in west africa and from two species of new world leaf-nosed fruit bats phyllostomidae artibeus jamaicensis and artibeus lituratus in central america a sequence-independent virus discovery technique vidisca was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses a parv4-like virus named eh-btpv-1 in eidolon helvum from ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in artibeus jamaicensis from panama aj-btpv-1 those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. aj-btpv-1 was also found in artibeus lituratus 5.5%. both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations up to 10e8 and to 10e10 copies/ml for aj-btpv-1 and eh-btpv-1 respectively eh-btpv-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats brain lungs liver spleen kidneys and intestine and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock we also provide evidence that a variety of parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin ecologies and climatic ranges
coronaviruses which are single stranded positive sense rna viruses are responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals the gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts within this genus of coronaviruses the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry ibv shows rapid evolution in chickens frequently producing new antigenic types which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect rapid evolution in ibv is facilitated by strong selection large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts and transmission bottlenecks between hosts genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation which includes substitutions insertions and deletions mutations are caused both by the high error rate and limited proof reading capability of the viral rna-dependent rna-polymerase and by recombination recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants rapid evolution of avian coronavirus ibv makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv targets the intestinal mucosa in pigs to protect against pedv invasion a mucosal vaccine is utilized effectively in this study we generated a recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the heat-labile enterotoxin b ltb and the core neutralizing epitope coe of pedv rad-ltb-coe the fusion protein ltb-coe was successfully expressed by the recombinant adenovirus in hek293 cells and the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was assessed in balb/c mice and piglets three intramuscular or oral vaccinations with rad-ltb-coe at two-week intervals induced robust humoral and mucosal immune responses moreover a cell-mediated immune response was promoted in immunized mice and the neutralizing antibody inhibited both the vaccine strain and the emerging pedv isolate immunization experiments in piglets revealed that rad-ltb-coe was immunogenic and induced good immune responses in piglets further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of rad-ltb-coe against a highly virulent pedv challenge

several vaccine strategies aim to generate cell-mediated immunity cmi against microorganisms or tumors while epitope-based vaccines offer advantages knowledge of specific epitopes and frequency of major histocompatibility complex mhc alleles is required here we show that using promiscuous overlapping synthetic peptides osp as immunogens generated peptide-specific cmi in all vaccinated outbred mice and in different strains of inbred mice cmi responses also recognized viral proteins osp immunogens also induced cmi ex vivo in dendritic cell/t-cell cocultures involving cells from individuals with different hla haplotypes thus broad cmi was induced by osp in different experimental settings using different immunogens without identifying either epitopes or mhc backgrounds of the vaccinees
astroviruses are known to infect humans and a wide range of animal species and can cause gastroenteritis in their hosts recent studies have reported astroviruses in bats in europe and in several locations in china we sampled 1876 bats from 17 genera at 45 sites from 14 and 13 provinces in cambodia and lao pdr respectively and tested them for astroviruses our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various yangochiroptera and yinpterochiroptera bats evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found furthermore additional pteropodid hosts were detected the astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus mamastrovirus most closely related to other known bat astroviruses the astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully an astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts including from ungulates and porcupines was found in a rousettus bat these findings suggest that diverse astroviruses can be found in many species of mammals including bats

an outbreak of influenza h1n1 in 2009 representing the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century was transmitted to over a million individuals and claimed 18449 lives the current status in many countries is to prepare influenza vaccine using cell-based or egg-based killed vaccine however traditional influenza vaccine platforms have several limitations to overcome these limitations many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms one of the alternative approach we reported the efficacy of influenza ha vaccination using a baculoviral dna vaccine acherv-ha however the immune response elicited by the acherv-ha vaccine which only targets the ha antigen was lower than that of the commercial killed vaccine to overcome the limitations of this previous vaccine we constructed a human endogenous retrovirus herv envelope-coated baculovirus-based virus-like-particle vlp-forming dna vaccine termed acherv-vlp against pandemic influenza a/california/04/2009 ph1n1 balb/c mice immunized with acherv-vlp 1×10 7 ffu acherv-vlp i m and compared with mice immunized with the killed vaccine or mice immunized with acherv-ha as a result acherv-vlp immunization produced a greater humoral immune response and exhibited neutralizing activity with an intrasubgroup h1 strain pr8 elicited neutralizing antibody production a high level of interferon-γ secretion in splenocytes and diminished virus shedding in the lung after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus in conclusion vlp-forming baculovirus dna vaccine could be a potential vaccine candidate capable of efficiently delivering dna to the vaccinee and vlp forming dna eliciting stronger immunogenicity than egg-based killed vaccines
we report here the production of transgenic potato plants expressing the major capsid protein vp6 of bovine group a rotavirus gar transgenic plants under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter or a modified promoter linked to the tobacco mosaic virus 5 -untranslated sequence were positive for gar antigens by elisa the expressed protein was consistent in size with vp6 of gar by western blot assay the presence of the vp6 gene and its transcript was detected by pcr and rt-pcr adult balb/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with concentrated transgenic potato extracts emulsified in freund's adjuvant sera collected after immunization showed the anti-vp6 response in elisa and western blot assay these results suggest that the immunogenic vp6 protein expressed in plants could be useful for the preparation of diagnostic reagents

detection and characterization of novel viruses is hampered frequently by the lack of properly stored materials especially for the retrospective identification of viruses responsible for past disease outbreaks often only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ffpe tissue samples are available although ffpe tissues can be used to detect known viral sequences the application of ffpe tissues for detection of novel viruses is currently unclear in the present study it was shown that sequence-independent amplification in combination with next-generation sequencing can be used to detect sequences of known and unknown viruses although with relatively low sensitivity these findings indicate that this technique could be useful for detecting novel viral sequences in ffpe tissues collected from humans and animals with disease of unknown origin when other samples are not available in addition application of this method to ffpe tissues allows to correlate with the presence of histopathological changes in the corresponding tissue sections
virus-like particles vlps are nanostructures that resemble the structures of viruses they are composed of one or more structural proteins that can be arranged in several layers and can also contain a lipid outer envelope vlps trigger a high humoral and cellular immune response due to their repetitive structures a key factor regarding vlp safety is the lack of viral genomic material which enhances safety during both manufacture and administration contemporary vlp production may take advantage of several systems including bacterial yeast insect and mammalian cells the choice of production platform depends on several factors including cost and the need for post-translational modifications ptms which can be essential in generating an optimal immune response some vlp-based vaccines designed to prevent several infectious diseases are already approved and on the market with many others at the clinical trial or research stage interest in this technology has recently increased due to its advantages over classical vaccines this paper reviews the state-of-the-art of vlp production systems and the newest generation of vlp-based vaccines now available
background neonatal diarrhoea represents a major disease problem in the early stages of animal production increasing significantly pre-weaning mortality and piglets weaned below the target weight enteric diseases in newborn piglets are often of endemic presentation but may also occur as outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality the objective of this study was to assess the frequency of different pathogens involved in cases of recurrent neonatal diarrhoea in spain results a total of 327 litters from 109 sow farms located in spain with neonatal recurrent diarrhoea were sampled to establish a differential diagnosis against the main enteric pathogens in piglets in total 105 out of 109 96.3% case submissions were positive to one of the examined enteric organisms considered potentially pathogenic escherichia coli clostridium perfringens types a and c transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus or rotavirus a . fifty-eight out of 109 53.2% submissions were positive for only one of these pathogens 47 out of 109 43.1% were positive for more than one pathogen and finally 4 out of 109 3.7% were negative for all these agents escherichia coli strains were isolated from all submissions tested but only 11 of them were classified into defined pathotypes clostridium perfringens type a was detected in 98 submissions 89.9% and no c perfringens type c was found regarding viruses 47 43.1% submissions were positive for rva 4 3.7% for pedv and none of them for tgev conclusion in conclusion c perfringens type a e coli and rva were the main pathogens found in faeces of neonatal diarrheic piglets in spain
current natural populations face new interactions because of the re-emergence of ancient microbes and viruses these risks come from the re-emergence of pathogens kept in laboratories or from pathogens that are retained in the permafrost which become available upon thawing due to climate change we here focus on the effects of such re-emergence in natural host populations based on evolutionary theory of virulence and long-term studies which investigate host-pathogen adaptations pathogens tend to be locally and temporally adapted to their co-occurring hosts but when pathogens from a different environment or different time enter the host community the degree to which a new host-pathogen interaction is a threat will depend on the specific genotypic associations the time lag between the host and the pathogen and the interactions with native or recent host and pathogen species some insights can be obtained from long-term studies using a resurrection ecology approach these longterm studies based on time-shift experiments are essential to obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying host-pathogen coevolution at several ecological and temporal scales as past pathogens and their corresponding hosts can differ in infectivity and susceptibility strong reciprocal selective pressures can be induced by the pathogen these strong selective pressures often result in an escalating arms race but do not necessarily result in increased infectivity over time human health can also be impacted by these resurrected pathogens as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses which are infectious diseases originating from animal populations naturally transmitted to humans the sanitary risk associated with pathogen emergence from different environments spatial or temporal depends on a combination of socioeconomic environmental and ecological factors that affect the virulence or the pathogenic potential of microbes and their ability to infect susceptible host populations cross-infection experiments host-parasite interactions permafrost resurrected microbes transplants virulence evolution
infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health in order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and develop effective diagnostic tools therapeutic agents and preventive vaccines a suitable animal model which can represent the characteristics of infectious is required the syrian hamster immune responses to infectious pathogens are similar to humans and as such this model is advantageous for studying pathogenesis of infection including post-bacterial viral and parasitic pathogens along with assessing the efficacy and interactions of medications and vaccines for those pathogens this review summarizes the current status of syrian hamster models and their use for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen infection in addition to their use as a drug discovery platform and provides a strong rationale for the selection of syrian hamster as animal models in biomedical research the challenges of using syrian hamster as an alternative animal model for the research of infectious diseases are also addressed
the 2014-15 ebola outbreak in west africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics here we discuss drivers strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens chimpanzee adenoviral chad vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer chad vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human ad vectors for these reasons such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here particularly for lassa fever nipah and mers progression of the vectored vaccine approach success of rapid clinical production and testing of ebola and malaria vaccine vectors
bats are known to harbor and transmit many emerging and re-emerging viruses many of which are extremely pathogenic in humans but do not cause overt pathology in their bat reservoir hosts henipaviruses nipah and hendra filoviruses ebola and marburg and coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks with virus shed in bat feces urine and saliva an additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods e g mosquitoes ticks biting midges etc known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited to this end a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods serosurveillance and viral isolation from either free-ranging or captive bats are described in relation to four arboviral groups bunyavirales flaviviridae reoviridae togaviridae further ecological associations between bats and hematophagous viral vectors are characterized e g bat bloodmeals in mosquitoes ingestion of mosquitoes by bats etc lastly knowledge gaps related to hematophagous ectoparasites bat bugs and bed bugs cimicidae and bat flies nycteribiidae and streblidae in addition to future directions for characterization of bat-vector-virus relationships are described
monoclonal antibody mab technology has reached a state of maturity making it possible to rapidly discover and produce fully human mabs which neutralize any given virus in vitro several antibodies have also shown good prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in relevant animal models of viral disease surprisingly only one antiviral mab has been licensed to date it is used to prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus in at-risk infants certain paradigms of mabs prevailing in industry and academia are obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use there is a perception that mabs are much more effective in prophylactic than therapeutic use offer limited breadth of protection against different viral strains are prone to select neutralization escape variants and need to be given in high doses which are still comparatively costly to manufacture based on a review of the literature and our own data we propose that by combining two or more noncompeting neutralizing antibodies viral escape can effectively be controlled and in case of synergistic action of the mabs it may be possible to significantly reduce the total antibody concentration required for protection the combination of mabs with specific antiviral drugs has the potential to expand their use from pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis to therapy of acute and chronic viral infections
the receptor-binding domains rbds located in toxin a and toxin b of clostridium difficile are known to be nontoxic and immunogenic we need to develop a new type vaccine based on rbds in this study we expressed and purified recombinant proteins named rbd-tcda and rbd-tcdb as vaccine candidates containing the rbds of toxin a and toxin b respectively from the c difficile reference strain vpi10463 the immunogenicity and protection of the vaccine candidates rbd-tcda rbd-tcdb and rbd-tcda/b was evaluated by elisa and survival assays the data indicated that mice immunized with all vaccine candidates displayed potent levels of rbd-specific serum igg following intramuscular immunization of mice with rbd-tcda and/or rbd-tcdb these vaccine candidates triggered immune responses that protected mice compared to mice immunized with aluminum hydroxide alone taken together the results of this study reveal that recombinant proteins containing rbds of c difficile toxins can be used for vaccine development additionally we found that an rbd-tcda/b vaccine can elicit a stronger humoral immune response and provide better immunoprotection than the univalent vaccines this rbd vaccine candidate conferred significant protection against disease symptoms and death caused by toxins from a wild-type c difficile strain
emerging pathogens are either new or newly recognized or those that are increasing in incidence and spread since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic the highly pathogenic sars coronavirus sars-cov emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars many patients with sars-cov experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and west nile virus the severity of sars-cov disease increased with age unfortunately successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging immune senescence due to the rapidity of virus emergence technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation we discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human sars-cov has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases in addition we review the evolution epidemiology and pathogenesis of epidemic and zoonotic sars-cov with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoonotic pool
this study compared the performances of three commercial transmissible gastroenteritis virus/porcine respiratory coronavirus tgev/prcv blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas using serum samples n ϭ 528 collected over a 49-day observation period from pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue n ϭ 12 tgev strain miller n ϭ 12 prcv n ϭ 12 or with virus-free culture medium n ϭ 12 elisa results were evaluated both with "suspect" results interpreted as positive and then as negative all commercial kits showed excellent diagnostic specificity 99 to 100% when testing samples from pigs inoculated with virus-free culture medium however analyses revealed differences between the kits in diagnostic sensitivity percent tgev-or prcvseropositive pigs and all kits showed significant p ͻ 0.05 cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv serum antibodies particularly during early stages of the infections serologic cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv seemed to be tgev strain dependent with a higher percentage of prcv-false-positive results for pigs inoculated with tgev purdue than for tgev miller moreover the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive regardless of the elisa kit evaluated importance current measures to prevent tgev from entering a naive herd include quarantine and testing for tgev-seronegative animals however tgev serology is complicated due to the cross-reactivity with prcv which circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide conventional serological tests cannot distinguish between tgev and prcv antibodies however blocking elisas using antigen containing a large deletion in the amino terminus of the prcv s protein permit differentiation of prcv and tgev antibodies several commercial tgev/prcv blocking elisas are available but performance comparisons have not been reported in recent research this study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between tgev and prcv affects the accuracy of commercial blocking elisas individual test results must be interpreted with caution particularly in the event of suspect results therefore commercial tgev/prcv blocking elisas should only be applied on a herd basis
a simple indirect immune electron microscopy technique using ferritin-iabelled antibodies and negative staining to rapidly visualize and identify human viruses is described the increased electron density given by the ferritin molecules which also served as a reliable marker has greatly facilitated virus detection
the aim of this was to investigate the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps in the oas1 gene and the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection in a population from the liaoning province of china high resolution melt hrm-pcr analysis was conducted to examine three oas1 snps rs2660 g/a rs10774671 g/a and rs3741981 g/a in 298 chronic hcv-infected patients and in 305 healthy controls and to identify a relationship between snp genotype and susceptibility to chronic hcv infection using a case-control study design these three oas1 snps were in strong linkage disequilibrium rs2660 vs rs10774671 |d'|=1.000 r 2 =1.000 rs2660/rs10774671 vs rs3741981 |d'|=0.938 r 2 =0.569 the frequency of ag gg genotypes in both rs2660 and rs10774671 and the aa ag genotype in rs3741981 was significantly higher among chronic hcvinfected patients than among control p \ 0.001 the a allele in all three snps was found more frequently in the chronic hcv-infected group than in the control group rs2660 and rs10774671 p = 0.02 rs3741981 p \ 0.001 moreover individuals carrying the a allele in these snps exhibited an increased risk for chronic hcv infection rs2660 and rs10774671 or = 1.356 rs3741981 1.363 . the haplotype created by the g allele at both rs2660 and rs10774671 and the a allele at rs3741981 increased the risk of chronic hcv infection by 3.394-fold 95 % ci 1.406-8.201 our results identify oas1 snp rs2660 rs10774671 and rs3741981 as genetic risk factors for chronic hcv infection polymorphisms of the oas1 gene might affect the susceptibility to chronic infection with hcv
although transfusion is now extremely safe the tools of molecular biology are continually being harnessed to improve diagnosis and therapy viral genome testing has been introduced in the developed world for hiv and hcv to detect donors in the infectious "window period" before sero-conversion pathogen inactivated fresh frozen plasma and platelets are already available but alloimmunization has halted trials of pathogen-inactivated red cells development of synthetic oxygen carriers has included perflurocarbons and crosslinked polymerized or mutated human or bovine hemoglobin either free or encapsulated no perfect replacement for the human red cell is yet on the horizon
yersinia pestis outer proteins plasminogen activator protease and yop secretion protein f are necessary for the full virulence of yesinia pestis and have been proposed as potential protective antigens for vaccines against plague in the current study we used dna immunization as a tool to study the relative protective immunity of these proteins with a standardized intranasal challenge system in mice while the natural full-length gene sequences for most of these y pestis proteins did not display a good level of protein expression in vitro when delivered by a dna vaccine vector the overall immunogenicity of these wild type gene dna vaccines was low in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses and gene sequence modifications improved both of these parameters however even modified yopd yopo and yscf antigens were only able to partially protect immunized mice at various levels against lethal challenge with y pestis kim 1001 strain while no protection was observed with either the yopb or pla antigens these results demonstrate that dna immunization is effective in screening optimizing and comparing optimal antigen designs and immunogenicity of candidate antigens for the development of a subunit-based plague vaccine
china in the current study we investigated the genetic diversity of rvas in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in cameroon using viral metagenomics five near complete rva genomes were obtained a single rva strain showed a partial relationship with the kenyan bat rva strain whereas the other strains were completely novel only the vp7 and vp4 genes showed significant variability indicating the occurrence of frequent reassortment events comparing these bat rva strains with currently used human rva screening primers indicated that most of the novel vp7 and vp4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies therefore novel consensus screening primers were developed and used to screen samples from infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population although rva infections were identified in 36% of the infants there was no evidence of zoonosis this study identified multiple novel bat rva strains but further epidemiological studies in humans will have to assess if these viruses have the potential to cause gastroenteritis in humans rotaviruses rvs are major enteric pathogens causing severe dehydrating diarrhea mostly in juvenile humans and animals worldwide 1 . rvs belong to the family reoviridae and the genus rotavirus consists of eight species a-h 2 . recently a distinct canine rv species has been identified and tentatively named rotavirus i rvi although ratification by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv is pending 3 . group a rotaviruses rvas are the most common of all rotavirus species and infect a wide range of animals including humans 4 . the rotavirus genome consists of 11 double-stranded rna segments encoding 6 structural viral proteins vp1-vp4 vp6 and vp7 and 6 nonstructural proteins nsp1-nsp6 in 2008 a uniform classification system was proposed for each of the 11 gene segments resulting in g- p- i- r- c- m- a- n- t-
the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group mtbfg contains viruses associated with important human and animal diseases such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever in contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are frequent the evolutionary dynamic within the mtbfg was believed to be essentially clonal this assumption was challenged with the recent report of several homologous recombinations within the tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev we performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified recombinations however our results show for the first time that demonstrable recombination i e with large statistical support and strong phylogenetic evidences has occurred in the mtbfg more specifically within the louping ill virus lineage putative parents recombinant strains and breakpoints were further tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods we investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a bayesian framework the recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present by unravelling the temporal setting of the event we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination
a rhesus rotavirus vaccine adjuvanted with iscoms was injected intramuscularly to 5 pregnant baboons with repeated doses l-2 and 14 weeks after delivery maternal blood and milk samples and blood samples from their babies were collected at 2-weekly intervals until 26 weeks after parturition samples were assayed for rotavirus antibodies by elisas and neutralisation tests vaccination produced statistically significant increases in maternal serum igg and neutralising antibodies and in milk iga igg and neutralising antibodies control baboon mothers sampled from 12 weeks after delivery had lower serum and milk antibody titres but responded to vaccination at 16 weeks by producing a similar antibody projile in serum and milk to those previously vaccinated because of the endemic nature of human rotaviral infections similar maternal vaccinations have potential as a means of increasing milk antibodies to a level at which they may be protective to infants
to examine the possibility of a mycotic involvement in neonatal calf diarrhea ncd the presence of fungi was assessed in a the intestinal contents of dead calves and fecal samples submitted for routine laboratory examination b fecal specimens sampled once in winter and once in summer of calves raised on 2 farms with different management systems and c mucosal scrapings of various segments of the digestive tract of a diarrheic calf massively shedding candida glabrata c glabrata was the most prevalent fungal species isolated from the routine samples it was the only fungus which was shed by the calves on the 2 farms for continuous more or less prolonged periods but exclusively in the winter months diarrhea and c glabrata shedding seemed to be associated c glabrata colonized the abomasum the functional equivalent of the monogastric stomach but not the other segments of the digestive tract of the euthanized calf based on the findings of this study it seems that while some yeast species may be considered as commensals of the digestive tract of calves and consequently their isolation from intestinal contents or fecal samples has no clinical significance others such as c glabrata may be involved in enteric pathogenic processes moreover characteristics of the culture previous chemotherapeutic treatments the animal's age and possibly climatic conditions should be taken into account before deciding on the fungal isolate's clinical relevance determination of mycotic involvement in ncd by routine mycological examination of intestinal contents and fecal samples of diarrheic calves may be useful to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful antibacterial therapy
plant virus genomes are engineered as vectors for functional genomics and production of foreign proteins the application of plant virus vectors is of potential interest to the worldwide multibillion dollar grape and wine industries these applications include grapevine functional genomics pathogen control and production of beneficial proteins such as vaccines and enzymes however grapevine virus biology exerts certain limitations on the utility of the virus-derived gene expression and rna interference vectors as is typical for viruses infecting woody plants several grapevine viruses exhibit prolonged infection cycles and relatively low overall accumulation levels mainly because of their phloem-specific pattern of systemic infection here we consider the biotechnology potential of grapevine virus vectors with a special emphasis on members of the families closteroviridae and betaflexiviridae

passive immunity against enteric viral infections is dependent upon the continual presence in the gut lumen of a protective level of specific antibodies this article examines methods currently used to enhance the titre and duration of specific antibody in the mammary secretions of cows and pigs~ with particular reference to rotavirus and coronavirus infections in addition some of the potential problems to be found in attempting to produce vaccines against these viral infections are outlined
noroviruses are associated with intestinal disease in humans cows pigs mice and more recently dogs in 2007 the first canine norovirus cnv was identified and characterized in italy subsequent studies have identified cnv in stools of dogs from portugal greece and the united states to investigate the prevalence of cnv in the uk dog population 228 canine stool samples were screened for cnv by qpcr and 396 serum samples were screened for anti-cnv antibodies qpcr of rna extracted from canine stool samples did not reveal any cnv-positive samples based on samples collected from diarrhoeic and control dogs in 2012-2013 cnv virus-like particles to three different cnv strains were produced using recombinant baculoviruses and a seroprevalence screen undertaken anti-cnv antibodies were identified at significant levels in canine serum 38.1% of samples collected between 1999-2001 and 60.1% of samples collected in 2012-2013 were seropositive the increase in seroprevalence over time p0.001 suggests that the cnv strains screened for are becoming more widespread variation in seroprevalence to different cnv strains was also identified two-thirds of the dogs were seropositive to a single strain whereas the remaining third were seropositive to two or three of the strains analysed this study has provided the first evidence that cnv is present in the uk with seroprevalence identified to multiple circulating strains this warrants further study and increased awareness of this recently discovered canine virus
the emergence of influenza viruses resistant to existing classes of antiviral drugs raises concern and there is a need for novel antiviral agents that could be used therapeutically or prophylacticaly surfactant protein d sp-d belongs to the family of ctype lectins which are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with activity against bacteria and viruses including influenza viruses in the present study we evaluated the potential of recombinant porcine sp-d as an antiviral agent against influenza a viruses iavs in vitro to determine the range of antiviral activity thirty iavs of the subtypes h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 that originated from birds pigs and humans were selected and tested for their sensitivity to recombinant sp-d using these viruses it was shown by hemagglutination inhibition assay that recombinant porcine sp-d was more potent than recombinant human sp-d and that especially higher order oligomeric forms of sp-d had the strongest antiviral activity porcine sp-d was active against a broad range of iav strains and neutralized a variety of h1n1 and h3n2 iavs including 2009 pandemic h1n1 viruses using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea we demonstrated that recombinant porcine sp-d prevented attachment of human seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract it was concluded that recombinant porcine sp-d holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against influenza and further development and evaluation in vivo seems warranted citation hillaire mlb van eijk m van trierum se van riel d saelens x et al 2011 assessment of the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine sp-d against various influenza a viruses in vitro plos one 69 e25005
the role played by bats as a potential source of transmission of leptospira spp to humans is poorly understood despite various pathogenic leptospira spp being identified in these mammals here we investigated the prevalence and diversity of pathogenic leptospira spp that infect the straw-colored fruit bat eidolon helvum we captured this bat species which is widely distributed in africa in zambia during 2008-2013 we detected the flagellin b gene flab from pathogenic leptospira spp in kidney samples from 79 of 529 e helvum 14.9% bats phylogenetic analysis of 70 flab fragments amplified from e helvum samples and previously reported sequences revealed that 12 of the fragments grouped with leptospira borgpetersenii and leptospira kirschneri however the remaining 58 flab fragments appeared not to be associated with any reported species additionally the 16s ribosomal rna gene rrs amplified from 27 randomly chosen flab-positive samples was compared with previously reported sequences including bat-derived leptospira spp all 27 rrs fragments clustered into a pathogenic group eight fragments were located in unique branches the other 19 fragments were closely related to leptospira spp detected in bats these results show that rrs sequences in bats are genetically related to each other without regional variation suggesting that leptospira are evolutionarily well-adapted to bats and have uniquely evolved in the bat population our study indicates that pathogenic leptospira spp in e helvum in zambia have unique genotypes
we have developed a novel tuberculosis tb vaccine a combination of the dna vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 hsp65 and interleukin 12 il-12 delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of japan hvj-envelope and -liposome hsp65 + il-12/hvj an il-12 expression vector il-12dna encoding single-chain il-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed this vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the bcg vaccine on the basis of c f u of number of tb survival an induction of the cd8 positive ctl activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions this vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant tb mdr-tb and extremely drug resistant tb xdr-tb prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of tb in the lung in murine models furthermore we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis this novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than bcg based upon the assessment of mortality the esr body weight chest x-ray findings and immune responses all monkeys in the control group saline died within 8 months while 50% of monkeys in the hsp65+hil-12/hvj group survived more than 14 months post-infection the termination period of the experiment furthermore the bcg priming and hsp65 + il-12/hvj vaccine booster by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the tb-infected cynomolgus monkey 100% survival in contrast 33% of monkeys from bcg tokyo alone group were alive 33% survival furthermore this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy 100% survival and augmentation of immune responses in the tb-infected monkeys these data indicate that our novel dna vaccine might be useful against mycobacterium tuberculosis including xdr-tb and mdr-tb for human therapeutic clinical trials
development of necrotizing enterocolitis nec requires a susceptible host typically a premature infant or an infant with congenital heart disease enteral feedings and bacterial colonization although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of nec the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive unlike established normal adult gut microbiota which is quite complex uniform and stable early postnatal bacterial populations are simple diverse and fluid these properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of nec a broad variety of bacterial viral and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental nec frequently however the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals clustered outbreaks of nec in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest but do not prove a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease studies in cronobacter sakazakii the best characterized nec pathogen have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole but rather a characteristic of certain strains which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic the fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in nec progress in understanding the infectious nature of nec may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models
the viruses that infect humans cause a huge global disease burden and produce immense challenge towards healthcare system glycoproteins are one of the major components of human pathogenic viruses they have been demonstrated to have important roles in infection and immunity concomitantly high titres of antibodies against these antigenic viral glycoproteins have paved the way for development of novel diagnostics availability of appropriate biomarkers is necessary for advance diagnosis of infectious diseases especially in case of outbreaks as human mobilization has increased manifold nowadays dissemination of infectious agents became quicker that paves the need of rapid diagnostic system in case of viral infection it is an emergency as virus spreads and mutates very fast this review encircles the vast arena of viral glycoproteins their importance in health and disease and their diagnostic applications
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea vomiting and frequently death in piglets causing serious economic losses to the pig industry the strain chn-js-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology immunofluorescence assays transmission electron microscopy and sequence analysis a nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of chn-js-2017 is 97.4%-99.6% identical to other pdcov strains the pathogenicity of the chn-js-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets the piglets developed acute watery diarrhea but all recovered and survived chn-js-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine the neonatal fc receptor fcrn and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor pigr are crucial immunoglobulin ig receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin g igg iga or igm importantly chn-js-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of fcrn pigr and nuclear factor-kappa b nf-κbin the intestinal mucosa note that the level of fcrn mrna in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pigr and nf-κb at the same time the expressions of fcrn pigr and nf-κb mrna are also positively correlated in infected piglets these results may help explain the immunological and pathological changes associated with porcine deltacorononirus infection

bats are the only flying placental mammals that constitute the second largest order of mammals and present all around the world except in arctic antarctica and a few oceanic islands sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases originating from animals are zoonotic and more than two-thirds of them originate in wildlife bats were evolved as a super-mammal for harboring many of the newly identified deadly diseases without any signs and lesions their unique ability to fly particular diet roosting behavior long life span ability to echolocate and critical susceptibility to pathogens make them suitable host to harbor numerous zoonotic pathogens like virus bacteria and parasite many factors are responsible for the emergence of bat borne zoonoses but the most precipitating factor is human intrusions deforestation declined the natural habitat and forced the bats and other wild life to move out of their niche these stressed bats having lost foraging and behavioral pattern invade in proximity of human habitation either directly or indirectly they transmit the viruses to humans and animals development of fast detection modern techniques for viruses from the diseased and environmental samples and the lessons learned in the past helped in preventing the severity during the latest outbreaks
significance and impact of the study simple and cheap techniques to detect rabies virus or monitor immunity against it are central in maintaining epidemiological control over the disease particularly in endemic developing countries while many techniques meet this requirement they are confined to this usage as they are time-consuming and demand expensive instrumentation our immunochromatographic test strip can detect rabies antibody with high specificity and sensitivity the output can be measured with naked eye it allows safe and quick detection that will be of value in the surveillance of the immunization status of potential targets in rabies-endemic regions and will aid disease control we developed an immunochromatographic test strip using colloidal gold-coated staphylococcal protein a spa for the detection of rabies antibody in canine serum samples the recombinantly expressed rabies virus phosphoprotein rv-p and the anti-staphylococcal protein a anti-spa polyclonal antibody were coated on the test t and control c lines on a nitrocellulose membrane respectively this layout is designed such that the polyclonal antibody in canine serum is captured by the colloidal gold-spa conjugates before the rabies antibody complex is specifically selected by the rv-p deposited on the t line forming a 'sandwich' pattern unbound excess colloidal spa then proceeds to the control line where spa specifically interacts with the anti-spa antibody producing a red precipitation at the c line indicating the validity of the strip we tested 165 canine serum samples with the strips and the results were compared with those obtained using elisa the specificity and sensitivity of icts were found to be 93á1 and 92á2% respectively as a rapid technique not demanding expensive instrumentation the strip offers potential in disease monitoring especially in rabies-endemic developing countries
zoonoses are a worldwide public health concern accounting for approximately 75% of human infectious diseases in addition zoonoses adversely affect agricultural production and wildlife we review some mathematical models developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and identify areas where further modeling efforts are needed
emerging outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are affecting humans at an alarming rate until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood disease emergence will continue for lyme disease disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations to test the dilution effect in another disease we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted sin nombre virus genus hantavirus etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in its wildlife host the deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence as species diversity decreased infection prevalence increased the increase was moderate but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity a phenomenon described as zoonotic release the results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence conference summaries/reports are published online only manuscripts submitted for online publication may include illustrations and relevant links for more information on online only requirements please refer to author guidelines at
since the recognition of hantavirus as the agent responsible for haemorrhagic fever in eurasia in the 1970s and 20 years later the descovery of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the americas the genus hantavirus has been continually described throughout the world in a variety of wild animals the diversity of wild animals infected with hantaviruses has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife studies the known reservoirs are more than 80 belonging to 51 species of rodents 7 bats order chiroptera and 20 shrews and moles order soricomorpha more than 80genetically related viruses have been classified within hantavirus genus 25 recognized as human pathogens responsible for a large spectrum of diseases in the old and new world in brazil where the diversity of mammals and especially rodents is considered one of the largest in the world 9 hantavirus genotypes have been identified in 12 rodent species belonging to the genus akodon calomys holochilus oligoryzomys oxymycterus necromys and rattus considering the increasing number of animals that have been implicated as reservoirs of different hantaviruses the understanding of this diversity is important for evaluating the risk of distinct hantavirus species as human pathogens open access viruses 2014 6 1930
intestinal contents of suckling n045 and newly weaned n045 piglets suffering from diarrhea in the province of villa clara in cuba were tested for viral bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens from may to june 2008 at least one enteropathogen was identified in 53.3 % of piglets and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec 25.6 % was the major pathogen mostly sta + /stb + or f4 + /sta + /stb + etec were isolated the overall occurrence of the rest of pathogens was 10 % for transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and cryptosporidium parvum 6.7 % for rotavirus a and isospora suis 5.6 % for α-toxigenic clostridium perfringens 3.3 % for verotoxigenic e coli vtec and 2.2 % for salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar newport tgev and α-toxigenic c perfringens were only identified in suckling piglets while salmonella newport and vtec were only detected in weaned pigs porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv β-toxigenic c perfringens eimeria spp and helminths were not identified eight kinds of mixed infections were detected in 25 % of enteropathogen positive piglets etec was present in 10 of 12 mixed infections and tgev infections were never combined this survey demonstrates that several enteropathogens are circulating in piggeries located in the province of villa clara in cuba and that is necessary to improve surveillance prevention and control of enteric infections in order to increase production efficiency
japanese encephalitis virusjev tick-borne encephalitis virustbev and eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev can cause symptoms of encephalitis establishment of accurate and easy methods by which to detect these viruses is essential for the prevention and treatment of associated infectious diseases currently there are still no multiple antigen detection methods available clinically an elisa-array which detects multiple antigens is easy to handle and inexpensive has enormous potential in pathogen detection an elisa-array method for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis viruses was developed in this study seven monoclonal antibodies against five encephalitis-associated viruses were prepared and used for development of the elisa-array the elisa-array assay is based on a "sandwich" elisa format and consists of viral antibodies printed directly on 96-well microtiter plates allowing for direct detection of 5 viruses the developed elisa-array proved to have similar specificity and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional elisas this method was validated by different viral cultures and three chicken eggs inoculated with infected patient serum the results demonstrated that the developed elisa-array is sensitive and easy to use which would have potential for clinical use

since its discovery and characterization in the early 1980s as a virus that attacks the immune system there has been some success for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 infection however due to the overwhelming public health impact of this virus a vaccine is needed urgently despite the tireless efforts of scientist and clinicians there is still no safe and effective vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity a vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity against hiv infection remains elusive in part due to the following reasons 1 degree of diversity of the virus 2 ability of the virus to evade the hosts' immunity and 3 lack of appropriate animal models in which to test vaccine candidates there have been several attempts to stimulate the immune system to provide protection against hiv-infection here we will discuss attempts that have been made to induce sterilizing immunity including traditional vaccination attempts induction of broadly neutralizing antibody production dna vaccines and use of viral vectors some of these attempts show promise pending continued research efforts
high-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine providing sterilising immunity objectives to evaluate the ability of a high-cell-passage canine coronavirus vaccine to immunise dogs against challenge with a field isolate of the virus methods three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus-negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice at 21-day intervals with the vaccine and kept under observation two seronegative and virus-negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls for safety tests two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge results virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and pcr significantly the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed the two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge dog 1 and two days postchallenge dog 2 and by pcr for 23 median days clinical significance this study showed the efficacy of a high-cellpassage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and specifically its ability to induce sterilising immunity

it was found that antibodies abs against myelin basic protein mbp are the major components of the antibody response in multiple sclerosis ms patients we have recently shown that iggs from sera of ms patients are active in the hydrolysis of mbp however in literature there are no available data concerning possible mbp-hydrolyzing abs in cerebrospinal fluid csf of ms patients we have shown that the average content of iggs in their sera is about 195-fold higher than that in their csf here we have compared for the first time the average content of lambda-and kappa-iggs as well as iggs of four different subclasses igg1-igg4 in csf and sera of ms patients the average relative content of lambda-iggs and kappa -iggs in the case of csfs 8.0 and 92.0% and sera 12.3 and 87.7% are comparable while igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 csf -40.4 49.0 8.2 and 2.5% of total iggs respectively and the sera -53.6 36.0 5.6 and 4.8% decreased in different order electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous iggs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the csf proteins on protein g-sepharose and fplc gel filtration we present first evidence showing that iggs from csf efficiently hydrolyze mbp and that their average specific catalytic activity is unpredictably 54-fold higher than that of abs from sera of the same ms patients some possible reasons of these findings are discussed we suggest that anti-mbp abzymes of csf may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and in ms pathogenesis development citation doronin vb parkhomenko ta castellazzi m padroni m pastore m et al 2014 comparison of antibodies hydrolyzing myelin basic protein from the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with multiple sclerosis plos one 99 e107807
the antarctic krill euphausia superba is among the most studied species of the order euphausiacea in biological and ecological aspects however reports of their parasites and diseases are relatively scarce a worldwide overview of all parasites known for 48 out 86 extant euphausiid species includes 17 distinct types of epibionts pathogens parasites and parasitoids so far only seven of them have been reported interacting with e superba . the epibionts have interspecific associations that strongly depend on the krill's moult cycle discarding them at each moulting event their colonization and intensity show a remarkable synchronization with the krill moulting process at individual school and population levels the social and sometimes highly dense swarms and schools of e superba its keystone trophic function both as voracious predator and as prey to multiple predators should make it a critical vector for trophically transmitted parasites in the food web however e superba interacts with a relatively low diversity of epibionts pathogens and parasites in comparison with parasite diversity known for relatively well-studied temperate meganyctiphanes norvegica euphausia pacifica and subtropical nyctiphanes simplex euphausiid species the apparently low parasite diversity of e superba is likely associated with its antarctic zoogeographic pattern where parasites have not invaded the antarctic krill with the same evolutionary success as have occurred with other euphausiid species from tropical subtropical temperate and even arctic ecosystems
intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza virus laiv vaccines provide significant protection against heterologous influenza a virus iav challenge however laiv administration can modify the bacterial microbiota in the upper respiratory tract including alterations in species that cause pneumonia we sought to evaluate the effect of bordetella bronchiseptica colonization on laiv immunogenicity and efficacy in swine and the impact of laiv and iav challenge on b bronchiseptica colonization and disease laiv immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by b bronchiseptica colonization but protective efficacy against heterologous iav challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired titers of iav in the nose and trachea of pigs that received laiv were significantly reduced when compared to non-vaccinated challenged controls regardless of b bronchiseptica infection pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with b bronchiseptica and challenged with iav but this was regardless of laiv vaccination status while laiv vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous iav challenge the protection was not sterilizing and iav replicated in the respiratory tract of all laiv vaccinated pig the interaction between iav b bronchiseptica and host led to development of acute-type b bronchiseptica lesions in the lung thus the data presented do not negate the efficacy of laiv vaccination but instead indicate that controlling b bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between iav and bordetella on swine health
invasive wildlife species have the potential to act as additional host and vector species for infectious diseases the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonides a carnivore species that has its origin in asia was taken as an example to demonstrate biological and ecological prerequisites which enables an invasive species to occupy a new habitat permanently studies conducted during the last 20 years identified a total of 35 species of endoparasites five ectoparasites six bacterial or protozoan species and five viruses found in the subspecies nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis in its original and newly occupied habitat or in nyctereutes procyonoides koreensis in its original habitat respectively with reference to raccoon dogs impact as vector species and the relevance for human and animal health we selected trichinella spp echinococcus multilocularis francisella tularensis rabies virus and canine distemper virus for detailed description results of studies from finland and germany furthermore showed that biological characteristics of the raccoon dog make this carnivore an ideal host and vector for a variety of pathogens this may result in a growing importance of this invasive species concerning the epidemiology of some transmissible diseases in europe including the hazard that the existence of autochthonous wildlife particularly small populations is endangered potential adverse effects on human and animal health in the livestock sector must also be taken into account especially with regard to its potential as a reservoir for zoonotic diseases the raccoon dog should receive more attention in disease prevention and eradication strategies

papillomaviruses pvs are widespread pathogens however the extent of pv infections in bats remains largely unknown this work represents the first comprehensive study of pvs in iberian bats we identified four novel pvs in the mucosa of free-ranging eptesicus serotinus eserpv1 eserpv2 and eserpv3 and rhinolophus ferrumequinum rferpv1 individuals and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships within the viral family we further assessed their prevalence in different populations of e serotinus and its close relative e isabellinus although it is frequent to read that pvs co-evolve with their host that pvs are highly species-specific and that pvs do not usually recombine our results suggest otherwise first strict virus-host co-evolution is rejected by the existence of five distantly related bat pv lineages and by the lack of congruence between bats and bat pvs phylogenies second the ability of eserpv2 and eserpv3 to infect two different bat species e serotinus and e isabellinus argues against strict host specificity finally the description of a second noncoding region in the rferpv1 genome reinforces the view of an increased susceptibility to recombination in the e2-l2 genomic region these findings prompt the question of whether the prevailing paradigms regarding pvs evolution should be reconsidered

filoviridae cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in sub-saharan africa the egyptian rousette bat erb is a natural reservoir host for the marburgviruses and evidence suggests that bats are also natural reservoirs for the ebolaviruses although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific igg antibodies here we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive erbs with all seven known culturable filoviruses after validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect elisas utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific igg antibodies from bat sera we assess the level of serological crossreactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens this data is then used to generate a filovirus antibody fingerprint that can predict which of the filovirus species in the system is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection our filovirus igg indirect elisa system will be a critical tool for identifying bat species with high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates to target for longitudinal studies aimed at establishing natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships
the large virus family paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses such as measles- distemper- mumps- parainfluenza- newcastle disease- respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species 9278 individuals major discoveries include evidence of an origin of hendra-and nipah virus in africa identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus mouse pneumonia-and canine distemper virus in bats as well as direct evidence of sendai virus in rodents phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major paramyxoviridae subfamilies paramyxovirinae and pneumovirinae future attempts to predict the emergence of novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on these data
starting in 2006 bluetongue virus serotype 8 btv8 was responsible for a major epizootic in western and northern europe the magnitude and spread of the disease were surprisingly high and the control of btv improved significantly with the marketing of btv8 inactivated vaccines in 2008 during late summer of 2011 a first cluster of reduced milk yield fever and diarrhoea was reported in the netherlands congenital malformations appeared in march 2012 and schmallenberg virus sbv was identified becoming one of the very few orthobunyaviruses distributed in europe at the start of both epizootics little was known about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these viruses in the european context and most assumptions were extrapolated based on other related viruses and/or other regions of the world standardized and repeatable models potentially mimicking clinical signs observed in the field are required to study the pathogenesis of these infections and to clarify their ability to cross the placental barrier this review presents some of the latest experimental designs for infectious disease challenges with btv or sbv infectious doses routes of infection inoculum preparation and origin are discussed particular emphasis is given to the placental crossing associated with these two viruses
a 5-year-old female yorkshire terrier dog died a few days following hernia and ovariohysterectomy surgeries necropsy performed on the dog revealed that the surgeries were not the cause of death however degenerative viral hepatitis showing intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatic cells was observed in histopathologic examination several diagnostic methods were used to screen for the cause of disease and minute virus of canines mvc was detected in all parenchymal organs including the liver other pathogens that may cause degenerative viral hepatitis were not found infection with mvc was confirmed by in situ hybridization which revealed the presence of mvc nucleic acid in the liver tissue of the dog through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete genome sequence the strain was found to be distinct from other previously reported mvc strains these results indicate that this novel mvc strain might be related to degenerative viral hepatitis in dogs
two groups with three wild boars each were used group a animals 1 to 3 served as the control and group b animals 4 to 6 was postnatally persistently infected with the cat01 strain of csfv primary virus the animals six weeks old and clinically healthy were inoculated with the virulent strain margarita secondary virus for exclusive detection of the margarita strain a specific qrt-pcr assay was designed which proved not to have crossreactivity with the cat01 strain the wild boars persistently infected with csfv were protected from superinfection by the virulent csfv margarita strain as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of margarita rna detection in serum swabs and tissue samples additionally in pbmcs a well-known target for csfv viral replication only the primary infecting virus rna cat01 strain could be detected even after the isolation in st cells demonstrating sie at the tissue level in vivo furthermore the data analysis of the margarita qrt-pcr by means of calculated δct values supported that pbmcs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the margarita virus strain while this virus was able to infect naive pbmcs efficiently in parallel ifn-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in group b after inoculation with the csfv margarita strain furthermore these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral no e2-specific or neutralising antibodies or cellular immune responses in terms of ifn-γ-producing cells after inoculation with the second virus finally a sequence analysis could not detect csfv margarita rna in the samples tested from group b our results suggested that the sie phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus as well as in csfv control by vaccination to the best of our knowledge this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in plos one |
it is of paramount importance to evaluate the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of sars-cov-2 infection and their antibody response profile here we performed a pilot study to assess the levels of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in samples taken from 491 preepidemic individuals 51 patients from hôpital bichat paris 209 pauci-symptomatic individuals in the french oise region and 200 contemporary oise blood donors two in-house elisa assays that recognize the full-length nucleoprotein n or trimeric spike s ectodomain were implemented we also developed two novel assays the s-flow assay which is based on the recognition of s at the cell surface by flow-cytometry and the lips assay that recognizes diverse antigens including s1 or n cterminal domain by immunoprecipitation overall the results obtained with the four assays were similar with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use high antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity assessed using infectious sars-cov-2 or lentiviral-s pseudotypes in hospitalized patients seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset confirming previous studies seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of covid cases altogether our assays allow for a broad evaluation of sars-cov2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different population subsets
the seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses a seasonal h3n2 virus and an h3n2 variant virus the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the h3n2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer we report here that although increased levels of h3n2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal h3n2 virus enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings however overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air transmission occurred most frequently at 23°c/30%rh while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections
capybaras hydrochoerus hydrochaeris the world's largest rodents are distributed throughout south america these wild herbivores are commonly found near water bodies and are well adapted to rural and urban areas there is limited information on the viruses circulating through capybaras this study aimed to expand the knowledge on the viral diversity associated with capybaras by sampling their faeces using a viral metagenomics approach we identified diverse single-stranded dna viruses in the capybara faeces sampled in the distrito federal brazil a total of 148 complete genomes of viruses in the microviridae family were identified in addition 14 genomoviruses family genomoviridae a novel cyclovirus family circoviridae and a smacovirus family smacoviridae were identified also 37 diverse viruses that cannot be assigned to known families and more broadly referred to as unclassified circular replication associated protein encoding single-stranded cress dna viruses were identified this study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity associated with capybaras that may be infectious to these animals or associated with their microbiota or diet

feces from 142 animals were collected on 15 farms in the region of brittany france each sample was directly collected from the rectum of the animal and identified with the ear tag number animals were sampled three times at 5 15 and 22 weeks of age after dna extraction from stool samples nested pcr was performed to amplify partial 18s-rdna and 60 kda glycoprotein genes of cryptosporidium the parasite was detected on all farms one hundred out of 142 calves 70.4% were found to be parasitized by cryptosporidium amplified fragments were sequenced for cryptosporidium species identification and revealed the presence of c parvum 43.8% c ryanae 28.5% and c bovis 27%. one animal was infected with cryptosporidium ubiquitum the prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal c parvum caused 86.7% of cryptosporidium infections in 5-week-old calves but only 1.7% in 15-week-old animals the analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by c parvum c ryanae and c bovis for the study period c parvum gp60 genotyping identifies 6 iia subtypes of which 74.5% were represented by iiaa15g2r1 this work confirms previous studies in other countries showing that zoonotic c parvum is the dominant species seen in young calves
a divergent rotavirus i was detected using viral metagenomics in the feces of a cat with diarrhea the eleven segments of rotavirus i strain felis catus encoded non-structural and structural proteins with amino acid identities ranging from 25 to 79% to the only two currently sequenced members of that viral species both derived from canine feces no other eukaryotic viral sequences nor bacterial and protozoan pathogens were detected in this fecal sample suggesting the involvement of rotavirus i in feline diarrhea
passive immunity can be provided to animals by several sources of antibodies including from colostrum avian eggs and monoclonal sources these antibodies have been shown protect production and companion animals from a number of pathogens this chapter reviews the immune system for the principles of immune response to antigens and the synthesis of immunoglobulins of the five classes of antibodies in the body colostrum antibodies are described for passive immunity protection in animals such as calves chicken egg antibodies are another source of antibodies for passive immunity therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are also used to provide passive immunity in the veterinary field
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a recently identified coronavirus in the genus deltacoronavirus that can cause enteric disease including diarrhea vomiting dehydration and mortality in neonatal piglets serological assays to detect anti-pdcov antibodies are presently limited to certain laboratories and geographic regions in this study a recombinant m protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay pdcov-rm elisa was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-pdcov igg in hebei province the pdcov-rm elisa showed no cross-reaction with antisera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv porcine rotavirus prv porcine circovirus 2 pcv2 classical swine fever virus csfv or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv the diagnostic sensitivity was 90.6% and the diagnostic specificity was 93.3%. a total of 871 serum samples collected in hebei from january 2015 to october 2016 were checked for presence of antibodies against pdcov using the novel pdcov-rm elisa anti-pdcov igg antibodies were detected in 11% 96/871 of the samples and in 25% 10/40 of the investigated farms the data suggest that pdcov has a low seroprevalence in pig population in hebei province china
hemorrhagic fevers hf resulting from pathogenic arenaviral infections have traditionally been neglected as tropical diseases primarily affecting african and south american regions there are currently no fda-approved vaccines for arenaviruses and treatments have been limited to supportive therapy and use of non-specific nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin outbreaks of arenaviral infections have been limited to certain geographic areas that are endemic but known cases of exportation of arenaviruses from endemic regions and socioeconomic challenges for local control of rodent reservoirs raise serious concerns about the potential for larger outbreaks in the future this review synthesizes current knowledge about arenaviral evolution ecology transmission patterns life cycle modulation of host immunity disease pathogenesis as well as discusses recent development of preventative and therapeutic pursuits against this group of deadly viral pathogens
ebola virus ebov infection causes a frequently fatal hemorrhagic fever hf that is refractory to treatment with currently available antiviral therapeutics rna interference represents a powerful naturally occurring biological strategy for the inhibition of gene expression and has demonstrated utility in the inhibition of viral replication here we describe the development of a potential therapy for ebov infection that is based on small interfering rnas sirnas methods four sirnas targeting the polymerase l gene of the zaire species of ebov zebov were either complexed with polyethylenimine pei or formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles snalps guinea pigs were treated with these sirnas either before or after lethal zebov challenge results treatment of guinea pigs with a pool of the l gene-specific sirnas delivered by pei polyplexes reduced plasma viremia levels and partially protected the animals from death when administered shortly before the zebov challenge evaluation of the same pool of sirnas delivered using snalps proved that this system was more efficacious as it completely protected guinea pigs against viremia and death when administered shortly after the zebov challenge additional experiments showed that 1 of the 4 sirnas alone could completely protect guinea pigs from a lethal zebov challenge conclusions further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective treatments for ebov hf as well as for diseases caused by other agents that are considered to be biological threats ebola virus ebov family filoviridae is a singlestranded negative-sense rna virus that is among the best known of the viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever hf although outbreaks have been sporadic and geo-
background cats are susceptible to feline panleukopenia virus fpv and canine parvovirus cpv variants 2a 2b and 2c detection of fpv and cpv variants in apparently healthy cats and their persistence in white blood cells wbc and other tissues when neutralising antibodies are simultaneously present suggest that parvovirus may persist long-term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs the aim of this study was to screen a population of 54 cats from sardinia italy for the presence of both fpv and cpv dna within buffy coat samples using polymerase chain reaction pcr the dna viral load genetic diversity phylogeny and antibody titres against parvoviruses were investigated in the positive cats results carnivore protoparvovirus 1 dna was detected in nine cats 16.7%. viral dna was reassembled to fpv in four cats and to cpv cpv-2b and 2c in four cats one subject showed an unusually high genetic complexity with mixed infection involving fpv and cpv-2c antibodies against parvovirus were detected in all subjects which tested positive to dna parvoviruses conclusions the identification of fpv and cpv dna in the wbc of asymptomatic cats despite the presence of specific antibodies against parvoviruses and the high genetic heterogeneity detected in one sample confirmed the relevant epidemiological role of cats in parvovirus infection

background insect-borne diseases could induce severe symptoms in human and clinical signs in animals such as febrility erythra arthralgia and hemorrhagic fever and cause significant economic losses and pose public health threat all over the world the significant advantages of luminex xmap technology are high-throughput high parallel and automation this study aimed to establish a liquid bead array based on luminex xmap technology that was able to simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens methods specific probes and primers to detect the nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens were designed probes were coupled with fluorescent carboxylated microspheres the parameters of the system were optimized including ratio of forward/reverse primers 12 hybridization temperature 50°c and duration 30 min and quantity of pcr product 2 μl the sensitivity and specificity of the system were also evaluated moreover mixed nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens including bluetongue virus epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer coxiella burnetii african swine fever virus west nile fever virus borrelia burgdorferi vesicular stomatitis virus rift valley fever virus ebola virus and schmalenberg's disease virus and 3000 clinical samples were tested for practicability results the optimized detection system showed high sensitivity specificity and reproducibility each probe showed specific fluorescence signal intensity without any cross-hybridization for the other insect-borne pathogens tested which included dengue virus tick-borne encephalitis virus japanese encephalitis virus xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus spotted fever group rickettsiae ehrlichiae and chikungunya virus the limit of detection was 10 copies of target gene insect-borne pathogens were successfully detected among the 3000 clinical samples and the results were consistent with those obtained using gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits conclusions this optimized liquid array detection system was high-throughput and highly specific and sensitive in screening of the insect-borne pathogens it was promising in detection of these pathogens for molecular epidemiological studies
in 2013 a major chikungunya virus chikv epidemic reached the americas in the past 2 years >1.7 million people have been infected in light of the current epidemic with millions of people in north and south america at risk efforts to rapidly develop effective vaccines have increased here we focus on chikv vaccines that use viral-vector technologies this group of vaccine candidates shares an ability to potently induce humoral and cellular immune responses by use of highly attenuated and safe vaccine backbones so far well-described vectors such as modified vaccinia virus ankara complex adenovirus vesicular stomatitis virus alphavirus-based chimeras and measles vaccine schwarz strain mv/schw have been described as potential vaccines we summarize here the recent data on these experimental vaccines with a focus on the preclinical and clinical activities on the mv/schw-based candidate which is the first chikv-vectored vaccine that has completed a clinical trial
porcine rotavirus infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the swine industry necessitating the development of effective vaccines for the prevention of infection immune responses associated with protection are primarily mucosal in nature and induction of mucosal immunity is important for preventing porcine rotavirus infection lactobacillus casei expressing the major protective antigen vp4 of porcine rotavirus ppg612.1-vp4 or vp4-ltb heat-labile toxin b subunit from echerichia coli ppg612.1-vp4-ltb fusion protein was used to immunize mice orally the expression of recombinant ppg612.1-vp4 and ppg612.1-vp4-ltb was confirmed by sds-page and western blot analysis and surfacedisplayed expression on l casei was verified by immunofluorescence mice orally immunized with recombinant protein-expressing l casei produced high levels of serum immunoglobulin g igg and mucosal iga the iga titters from mice immunized with ppg612.1-vp4-ltb were higher than titters from ppg612.1-vp4-immunized mice the induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on rv infection these results demonstrated that vp4 administered in the context of an l casei expression system is an effective method for stimulating mucosal immunity and that ltb served to further stimulate mucosal immunity suggesting that this strategy can be adapted for use in pigs
immunoelectroosmophoresis complement fixation immunofluorescence on inoculated cell cultures electron microscopy and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were compared for the detection of rotavirus in faecal samples from calves rotavirus particles could be detected in 39 out of 98 faecal samples by electron microscopy immunofluorescence complement fixation and immunoelectroosmophoresis detected rotavirus antigens in 39 42 and 30 samples respectively the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated rotavirus antigens in 4-9 faecal samples the assay is not only sensitive but also simple to perform and suitable for large-scale testing
woode g n reed d e runnels p l herrig m a and hill h t 1982 studies with an unclassified virus isolated from diarrheic calves vet mierobiol 7 221--240 a transmissible agent breda agent was isolated from a calf with diarrhea and shown to be infectious by inoculation orally into gnotobiotic and conventionally reared calves the "breda" agent had the morphology of a virus and possessed a hemagglutinin antigenic studies showed the virus to be antigenically different from bovine coronavirus parainfluenza 3 virus bovine rotavirus bovine parvovirus and bovine pestivirus bvd attempts to culture the virus in cell or organ cultures or in embryonated eggs were unsuccessful the virus was either spherical or kidney shaped with 7--9 nm peplomers on the surface a few particles possessed coronavirus processes of 17--20 nm but these were arranged irregularly and were thought to be tissue debris three out of eight experimental calves developed severe diarrhea and the lesions in the small and large intestines were similar to those reported for coronavirus the virus replicated in the jejunal and ileal regions of the small intestine and in the spiral colon as judged by immunofiuorescence the virus multiplied in all experimental calves and was excreted in the feces excretion correlating with the onset of diarrhea or a change in the appearance of the feces there was little or no malabsorption measured by the uptake of d-xylose and the fact that infection of both the crypt and villus epithelial cells was observed suggests that the pathogenesis may be different from rotavirus and coronavirus fourteen of fortyseven calves in the outbreak were infected with the virus virus was not identified in other farm outbreaks of the disease
canine visceral leishmaniasis cell and humoral immune response flow cytometrya vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl comprising leishmania braziliensis promastigote protein sand fly gland extract sge and saponin adjuvant was evaluated in dog model in order to analyse the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine the vaccine candidate elicited strong antigenicity in dogs in respect of specific sge and leishmania humoral immune response the major saliva proteins recognized by serum from immunized dogs exhibited molecular weights of 35 and 45 kda and were related to the resistance pattern against leishmania infection immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating cd21 + b-cells * corresponding authors atet al and cd5 + t-cells reflected by higher counts of cd4 + and cd8 + t-cells the observed interaction between potential antigen-presenting cells evaluated as cd14 + monocytes and lymphocyte activation status indicated a relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses the higher frequency in l chagasi antigen-specific cd8 + t-lymphocytes and their positive association with intense cell proliferation in addition to the progressively higher production of serum nitric oxide levels showed a profile compatible with anti-cvl vaccine potential further studies on immunological response after challenge with l chagasi may provide important information that will lead to a better understanding on vaccine trial and efficacy
background bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses covs mainly alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus lyle's flying fox pteropus lylei's roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals knowledge about age-specific pattern of cov infection in p lylei prevalence and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control cov outbreak methods p lylei bats were captured monthly during january-december 2012 for detection of cov at three areas in chonburi province two human dwellings s1 and s2 where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost s3 nested rt-pcr of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene from rectal swabs was used for cov detection the strain of cov was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis results cov infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between may and october january in adults only and april in juveniles only of total rectal swab positives 68/367 18.5% ratio was higher in bats captured at s1 11/ 44 25.0% and s2 35/99 35.4% foraging sites than at roost s3 22/224 9.8%. juveniles forearm length ≤ 136 mm were found with more cov infection than adults at all three sites s1 9/24 37.5% vs 2/20 10% s2 22/49 44.9% vs 13/ 50 26.0% and s3 10/30 33.3% vs 12/194 6.2%. the average bci of cov infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats no gender difference related to infection was found at the sites phylogenetic analysis of conserved rdrp gene revealed that the detected covs belonged to group d betacoronavirus n = 64 and alphacoronavirus n = 4 the fact that cov infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored
salmonella enterica serotype heidelberg is primarily a poultry adapted serotype of salmonella that can also colonize other hosts and cause human disease in this study we compared the genomes of outbreak associated non-outbreak causing salmonella ser heidelberg strains from diverse hosts and geographical regions human outbreak associated strains in this study were from a 2015 multistate outbreak of salmonella ser heidelberg involving 15 states in the united states which originated from bull calves our clinicopathologic examination revealed that cases involving salmonella ser heidelberg strains were predominantly young less than weeks-old dairy calves pre-existing or concurrent disease was found in the majority of the calves detection of salmonella ser heidelberg correlated with markedly increased death losses clinically comparable to those seen in herds infected with s dublin a known serious pathogen of cattle whole genome based single nucleotide polymorphism based analysis revealed that these calf isolates formed a distinct cluster along with outbreak associated human isolates the defining feature of the outbreak associated strains when compared to older isolates of s heidelberg is that all isolates in this cluster contained saf fimbrial genes which are generally absent in s heidelberg the acquisition of several single nucleotide polymorphisms and the gain of saf fimbrial genes may have contributed to the increased disease severity of these salmonella ser heidelberg strains
development of effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov is still a priority in prevention of re-emergence of sars our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike s protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals but it is unknown whether rbd can also induce protective immunity in an animal model a key aspect for vaccine development in this study balb/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly i m with 10 g of rbd-fc rbd fused with human igg1 fc and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0 3 6 and 12 post-vaccination mice were challenged with the homologous strain of sars-cov 5 days after the last boost and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load virus replication and histopathological effects our results showed that rbd-fc vaccination induced high titer of s-specific antibodies with long-term and potent sars-cov neutralizing activity four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent sars-cov challenge because no significant virus replication and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with sars-cov only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues in contrast high copies of sars-cov rna and virus replication were detected and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice in conclusion our findings suggest that rbd which can induce protective antibodies to sars-cov may be further developed as a safe and effective sars subunit vaccine
during the last decade the role of wildlife in emerging pathogen transmission to domestic animals has often been pointed out conversely far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife here we focus on the case of game restocking which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year we conducted a 2year study in the camargue southern france to investigate the influence of hand-reared mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife we sampled mallards cloacal swabs from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release a very high 99% infection rate caused by an h10n7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009 we did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled neither during the infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks the 2009 h10n7 strain was fully sequenced it results from multiple reassortment events between eurasian low pathogenic strains interestingly h10n7 strains had previously caused human infections in egypt and australia the h10 and n7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the egyptian ones we did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence transmission to mammals or antiviral resistance in the h10n7 strain we identified our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats owing to duck rearing conditions measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced
a vaccine for equine coronavirus ecov is so far unavailable bovine coronavirus bcov is antigenically related to ecov it is therefore possible that bcov vaccine will induce antibodies against ecov in horses this study investigated antibody response to ecov in horses inoculated with bcov vaccine virus neutralization tests showed that antibody titers against ecov increased in all six horses tested at 14 days post inoculation although the antibody titers were lower against ecov than against bcov this study showed that bcov vaccine provides horses with antibodies against ecov to some extent it is unclear whether antibodies provided by bcov vaccine are effective against ecov and therefore ecov challenge studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in the future
this study was carried out to find the importance of cryptosporidium parvum in diarrhoea of neonatal calves in two types of breeding -suckling and dairy calves -in france different agents causing neonatal diarrhoea e coli rotavirus coronavirus salmonella and cryptosporidium were systematically researched in faeces 1 suckling calves in 40 livestock farms selected for diarrhoea 311 calves 4 to 10 days old which had diarrhoea for less than 24 h or no diarrhoea were included in the study a prophylaxis of neonatal diarrhoea had been carried out in 21 of the 40 livestock farms on d0 inclusion day the mean age was 6 days 82% presented a good initial general condition and 76.2% had a good appetite 48.6% were diarrhoeic but 91.3% presented no sign of dehydration only 6.1% were infected by e coli k99 14.3% by rotavirus 6.8% by coronavirus 0.3% by salmonella but 50% excreted c parvum oocysts this later percentage increases up to 84% and 86% by d3 and d7 respectively . we note that 16% of the 4-day-old calves on d0 are excreting oocysts and this percentage increases as a function of the age of the calf on d0 to reach 90% to 95% by the age of 8 days 10 out of 12 dead calves excreted c parvum oocysts from d0 to d14 the other pathogen agents show a relative or a decreasing stability 2 dairy calves 382 calves which had diarrhoea for less than 24 h or no diarrhoea aged 8 to 15 days coming from six industrial livestock farms were included in the study on d0 99% of the calves presented a good initial general condition 99.7% had a good appetite and no calf was dehydrated at this date d0 16.8% of the calves excreted cryptosporidia this percentage increases up to 23% and 51.8% on d3 and d8 respectively then decreases to 31.9% on d14 the pressure of the other pathogenic * corresponding author m naciri 0304-4017/99/$ -see front matter ©1999 elsevier science b v all rights reserved pii s 0 3 0 4 -4 0 1 7 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 -9 246 m naciri et al / veterinary parasitology 85 1999 agents remains relatively stable excepted for rotavirus on d7 from 9.9% on d0 to 27.2% on d7 then 12.6% on d14 which does not explain the concomitant peak in diarrhoea because the infection by rotavirus on d7 is more frequent in non-diarrhoeic calves than in diarrhoeic calves our results show that cryptosporidium prevalence is higher in suckling than in dairy calves and c parvum constitutes actually in both cases the major aetiological agent of neonatal diarrhoea
the leishmaniases are a complex of vector-borne diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania leishdnavax is a multi-antigen t-cell epitope-enriched dna vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis the vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies here we describe the safety testing of leishdnavax in naive mice and rats complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in leishmania-infected mice biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal i d administration to rats dna vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections although vector dna was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i d administration to naive non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns leishdnavax was also well tolerated in leishmania-infected mice taken together our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of leishdnavax in both naive and infected animals and thus support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine
background the intention of the following study was to describe the interrelationship between villagers domestic animals and wildlife at the community forestry concession of uaxactún guatemala by means of participatory epidemiological methods the main focus was generating information regarding different livestock diseases considered important by villagers and their relevance as well as obtaining knowledge concerning hunting activities and cooking methods to gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of people and animals and the diseases of their animals for poultry an overall prevalence of 41 % of newcastle disease was found by means of the elisa test by antibody detection chicken being the most affected species in the village no samples were positive to avian influenza with the hi test no virus was isolated by means of the tracheal or cloaca swabbing of ducks for hunting all species could be hunted by chance at any time of the year there was a difference in species hunted between seasons peccaries being more frequently hunted during the dry season and in contrast deer and wild avian during the rainy season for cooking villagers did not consume any raw meat the cooking methods depended on the species stewing was the most favoured method for peccaries wild birds tepezcuintle and domestic poultry whereas grilling was preferable for deer roasting for armadillos and marinating for pork according to the generated information the most important domestic livestock species in the village are chickens and pigs chickens being the most affected by diseases no evident health problems on pigs were observed in this study hunting was shown as an activity enhanced by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities in the village and was mostly directed at larger species such as deer and peccaries from the viewpoint of a transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans cooking methods mostly reflected a protective factor as no raw meat was eaten stews and broths being the most common forms of cooking involving an exposure of meat to high temperatures nonetheless both agricultural and hunting activities represent a risk factor for the spread of diseases as hunters may act as mechanical vectors for different pathogens within domestic and wild animal populations
vaccines are recognized worldwide as one of the most important tools for combating infectious diseases despite the tremendous value conferred by currently available vaccines toward public health the implementation of additional vaccine platforms is also of key importance in fact currently available vaccines possess shortcomings such as inefficient triggering of a cell-mediated immune response and the lack of protective mucosal immunity in this regard recent work has been focused on vaccine delivery systems as an alternative to injectable vaccines to increase antigen stability and improve overall immunogenicity in particular novel strategies based on edible or intradermal vaccine formulations have been demonstrated to trigger both a systemic and mucosal immune response these novel vaccination delivery systems offer several advantages over the injectable preparations including self-administration reduced cost stability and elimination of a cold chain in this review the latest findings and accomplishments regarding edible and intradermal vaccines are described in the context of the system used for immunogen expression their molecular features and capacity to induce a protective systemic and mucosal response
blood serum lipase activity was determined in 48 young dogs with acute enteritis or gastroenteritis due to canine parvovirus 16 cases and presumably to other infectious agents 32 cases elevated serum lipase activity > 500 u/l was found in 13 dogs 27.1 % with values ranging from 800 to 2780 u/l the hyperlipasemia of these cases may be attributed to acute pancreatitis secondary to acute gastroenteritis or to gastrointestinal upset
background the pteropine orthoreovirus prv was isolated from monkey macaca fascicularis faecal samples collected from human-inhabited areas in lopburi province thailand these samples were initially obtained to survey for the presence of hepatitis e virus hev results two virus isolates were retrieved by virus culture of 55 monkey faecal samples liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry lc-ms/ms was successfully used to identify the viruses as the segmented dsrna orthoreovirus phylogenetic analysis of the lopburi orthoreovirus whole-genomes revealed relationships with the well-characterised prvs pulau segment l1 cangyuan segments l2 m3 and s3 melaka segments l3 and m2 kampar segments m1 and s2 and sikamat segments s1 and s4 of southeast asia and china with nucleotide sequence identities of 93.5-98.9%. rt-pcr showed that prv was detected in 10.9% 6/55 and hev was detected in 25.5% 14/55 of the monkey faecal samples conclusions prv was isolated from monkey faeces for the first time in thailand via viral culture and lc-ms/ms the genetic diversity of the virus genome segments suggested a re-assortment within the prv species group the overall findings emphasise that monkey faeces can be sources of zoonotic viruses including prv and hev and suggest the need for active virus surveillance in areas of human and monkey co-habitation to prevent and control emerging zoonotic diseases in the future
the effects of transplacental porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 infection on porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv-induced enteritis were examined in neonatal piglets six pregnant sows were randomly allocated to an infected n = 3 or control group n = 3 three pregnant sows were inoculated intranasally with 6 ml of tissue culture fluid containing 1.2 · 10 5 tissue culture infective doses 50% tcid 50 /ml of pcv2 strain snuvr000470 three weeks before the expected farrowing date three control pregnant sows were similarly exposed to uninfected cell culture supernatants thirty piglets from pcv2-infected sows were randomly assigned to two groups a and b of 15 piglets each another 30 piglets from noninfected sows were randomly assigned to two groups c and d of 15 piglets each the piglets in groups a and c were dosed orally at three days of age with 2 ml of virus stock 1 · 10 6.5 tcid 50 /ml of the pedv strain snuvr971496 at the third passage the mean villous height and crypt depth vhcd ratio in pedv-infected piglets from pcv2-infected sows group a were significantly different from those of the pedv-infected piglets from pcv2 negative sows group c at 36 48 and 72 h post-inoculation hpi p < 0.05 in pedv-infected piglets from pcv2-infected sows group a significantly more pedv nucleic acid was detected in the jejunal tissues p < 0.05 at 24 hpi than in the same tissues of the pedv-infected piglets from pcv2 negative sows group c thereafter at 36 48 60 and 70 hpi significantly more pedv nucleic acid p < 0.05 was detected in the jejunal tissues of the pedvinfected piglets from pcv2 negative sows group c than those of the pedv-infected piglets from the pcv2-infected sows group a it is concluded that the clinical course of pedv disease was markedly affected by transplacental infection of pcv2
vaccination continues to have a major impact on the health of humans and animals furthermore vaccination of animals is proving to be effective in reducing transmission to humans understanding linkages between innate and adaptive immunity are improving formulations of new as well as existing vaccines making them more effective
to help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 bats from 21 species in china a total of 73 coronaviruses 32 alphacoronaviruses and 41 betacoronaviruses were identified in these bats with an overall prevalence of 6.84%. all newly-identified betacoronaviruses were sars-related rhinolophus bat coronaviruses sarsr-rh-batcov importantly with the exception of the s gene the genome sequences of the sarsr-rh-batcovs sampled in guizhou province were closely related to sars-related human coronavirus additionally the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses overall these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses
a critical global health need exists for a zika vaccine capable of mitigating the effects of future zika epidemics in this study we evaluated the antibody responses and efficacy of an aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted purified inactivated zika vaccine pizv against challenge with zika virus zikv strain prvabc59 indian rhesus macaques received two doses of pizv at varying concentrations ranging from 0.016 µg − 10 µg and were subsequently challenged with zikv six weeks or one year following the second immunization pizv induced a dose-dependent immune response that was boosted by a second immunization complete protection against zikv infection was achieved with the higher pizv doses of 0.4 µg 2 µg and 10 µg at 6 weeks and with 10 ug pizv at 1 year following vaccination partial protection was achieved with the lower pizv doses of 0.016 µg and 0.08 µg based on these data a neutralizing antibody response above 3.02 log 10 ec50 was determined as a correlate of protection in macaques pizv elicited a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response which is protective for at least 1 year following vaccination open scientific reports | 2020 103488 | https//doi to further evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy of pizv we conducted three zikv challenge studies in rhesus macaques in the first study we established a dose of prvabc59 challenge virus in the second study we determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of a wide range of pizv dose levels at 42 days after two pizv vaccinations to establish a potential antibody correlate of protection in the third study we assessed the persistence of immunity and efficacy 1 year following administration of the second pizv dose to evaluate neutralizing antibody kinetics and long-term protection

newcastle disease virus ndv is a member of the paramyxovirinae subfamily and can infect most species of birds it has been a great threat for the poultry industry all around the world in this report we successfully produced infectious pseudotyped pnl4-3-luc-r 2 e 2 hiv-luc viruses with the hn and f envelope proteins of ndv further investigation revealed the cytoplasmic domains of hn and f especially hn plays a significant role in the infection efficiency of these pseudotyped hiv-luc viruses replacement of or direct fusion to the cytoplasmic domain of the hn protein by that of vesicular stomatitis virus g vsv-g could greatly enhance or destroy the infective potential of hn and f-pseudotyped ndvpseudotyped hiv-luc virus we further established a novel neutralization assay to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against ndv with the ndv-pseudotyped hiv-luc viruses comparative neutralization data indicate that the results determined by using the ndv-pseudotyped hiv-luc viruses are as reliable as those by the conventional virus-neutralization assay vn test with native ndv moreover the results show that the novel neutralization assay is more sensitive than the vn test
in this review we consider the role played by eosinophilic leukocytes in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of respiratory virus infection the vast majority of the available information on this topic focuses on respiratory syncytial virus rsv family paramyxoviridae genus pneumovirus an important pediatric pathogen that infects infants worldwide there is no vaccine currently available for rsv a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine used in a trial in the 1960s elicited immunopathology in response to natural rsv infection this has been modeled experimentally primarily in inbred mice and cotton rats eosinophils are recruited to the lung tissue in response to formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine antigens in humans and in experimental models but they may or may not be involved in promoting the severe clinical sequelae observed pulmonary eosinophilia elicited in response to primary rsv infection has also been explored this response is particularly evident in the youngest human infants and in neonatal mouse models although pulmonary eosinophilia is nearly always perceived in a negative light the specific role played by virus-elicited eosinophils -negative positive or neutral bystander -remain unclear lastly we consider the data that focus on the role of eosinophils in promoting virus clearance and antiviral host defense and conclude with a recent study that explores the role of eosinophils themselves as targets of virus infection published by elsevier b v
studies on several viral pathogens have been hampered by the lack of appropriate in vitro systems for their propagation and amplification porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv an arterivirus containing a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome ∼15 kb was served as a model virus and its genomic cdna was recombinated into baculovirus we investigated whether infectious virus particles could be generated by expression of the full-length cloned genome from the modified baculovirus vector the recombinant baculovirus acaprrs was used to infect sf9 cells immunofluorescence assay demonstrated the presence of prrsv nonstructural protein nsp 2 and nucleocapsid n protein and electron microscopy revealed prrsv particles in the culture supernatant infectious prrsv particles were also produced in susceptible marc-145 cells inoculated with acaprrs and the growth characteristics of the prrsv generated were similar to those of the parental prrsv strain infectious prrsv particles were also generated following acaprrs transduction of bhk-21 cells and vero cells that are not sensitive to prrsv titers of prrsv obtained from bhk-21 and vero cells were up to 10 4.05 tcid 50 /ml these findings open a new route to the propagation of the virus in vitro and will be of utility in vaccine development
coronaviruses covs are a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand rna genome which continuously circulate in mammals and birds and pose a threat to livestock companion animals and humans covs harboured by avian species are classified to the genera gamma-and deltacoronaviruses within the gamma-covs the main representative is avian coronavirus a taxonomic name which includes the highly contagious infectious bronchitis viruses ibvs in chickens and similar viruses infecting other domestic birds such as turkeys guinea fowls or quails additionally ibvs have been detected in healthy wild birds demonstrating that they may act as the vector between domestic and free-living birds moreover covs other than ibvs are identified in wild birds which suggests that wild birds play a key role in the epidemiology of other gammacovs and deltacovs development of molecular techniques has significantly improved knowledge of the prevalence of covs in avian species the methods adopted in monitoring studies of covs in different avian species are mainly based on detection of conservative regions within the viral replicase nucleocapsid genes and 3'utr or 5'utr the purpose of this review is to summarise recent discoveries in the areas of epidemiology and diagnosis of covs in avian species and to understand the role of wild birds in the virus distribution

influenza and other respiratory viruses represent a significant threat to public health national security and the world economy and can lead to the emergence of global pandemics such as the current covid-19 crisis one of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat influenza coronaviruses and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust preclinical model preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput low-fidelity in vitro screening with cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical responses here we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a highthroughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface predict96-ali we present results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections providing multiple readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in an in vitro system several strains of influenza a virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface ali and as a proof-of-concept the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of influenza a is evaluated human coronaviruses nl63 hcov-nl63 and sars-cov-2 enter host cells via ace2 and utilize the protease tmprss2 for protein priming and we confirm expression of both in our ali model we also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with hcov-nl63 observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model this new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses

ducks and seabirds are natural hosts for influenza a viruses iav on oceanic islands the ecology of iav could be affected by the relative diversity abundance and density of seabirds and ducks seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the western indian ocean and in this region oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential iav host species based on serological assays we assessed the host range of iav and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the western indian ocean we further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for iav on oceanic islands not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as h16 but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks h3 h6 h9 h12 subtypes . we also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns we discuss the role of tern migrations in the spread of viruses to and between oceanic islands in particular for the h2 and h9 iav subtypes avian influenza viruses circulate in wild birds worldwide in particular in ducks and seabirds from which a large diversity of viruses have been described the continued emergence of influenza viruses in poultry and humans has stimulated both research activities plos pathogens |
epizootic rabbit enteropathy ere a highly lethal 30-80% mortality disease of broiler rabbits aged 6-14 weeks first appeared in 1997 in french intensive enclosed rabbitries and is of unknown aetiology bacteriological virological and parasitical examination of the intestinal contents of rabbits that had died either in spontaneous field cases or after experimental reproduction of ere were undertaken in an attempt to identify infectious agents that may play a role in the disease two bacterial strains clostridium perfringens and non-enteropathogenic escherichia coli were repeatedly isolated at high faecal counts from naturally infected animals in field cases a correlation between typical gross lesions of epizootic enteropathy and the presence of the alpha toxin of cl perfringens was observed p < 0.0001 chi-squared test although attempts to reproduce the disease by inoculation with different pools of cultivable bacterial strains failed the disease was successfully reproduced by inoculation with one french and two belgian samples of caecal contents
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a public health concern worldwide by studying the human leukocyte antigen hla types a b dr and dq alleles in 90 chinese patients with serologically confirmed sars infections we identified a strong association between hla-b*0703 or 4.08 95% ci 2.03-8.18 and -drb1*0301 or 0.06 95% 0.01-0.47 p p .00008 p .0042 and the development of sars moreover the frequency of b*0703 and b60 coinheritance 9.6% 95% ci 4.6%-19.0% in our sars group was significantly higher ϫ9 p p 3 ϫ 10 than that expected in the general population 0.4%. these genetic data will critically affect both the study of the pathogenesis of sars and the design of vaccination programs
human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 is a recently discovered human coronavirus found to cause respiratory illness in children and adults that is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and human coronaviruses 229e hcov-229e and oc43 hcov-oc43 methods we investigated the role that hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e played in children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in hong kong during the period from august 2001 through august 2002 results coronavirus infections were detected in 26 4.4% of 587 children studied 15 2.6% were positive for hcov-nl63 9 1.5% were positive for hcov-oc43 and 2 0.3% were positive for hcov-229e in addition to causing upper respiratory disease we found that hcov-nl63 can present as croup asthma exacerbation febrile seizures and high fever the mean age ‫ע‬ standard deviation of the infected children was 30.7 ‫ע‬ 19.8 months range 6-57 months the mean maximum temperature ‫ע‬sd for the 12 children who were febrile was 39.3њc ‫ע‬ 0.9њc and the mean total duration of fever ‫ע‬sd for all children was days range 1-5 days 2.6 ‫ע‬ 1.2 hcov-nl63 infections were noted in the spring and summer months of 2002 whereas hcov-oc43 infection mainly occurred in the fall and winter months of 2001 hcov-nl63 viruses appeared to cluster into 2 evolutionary lineages and viruses from both lineages cocirculated in the same season conclusions hcov-nl63 is a significant pathogen that contributes to the hospitalization of children and it was estimated to have caused 224 hospital admissions per 100000 population aged р6 years each year in hong kong
identification of the causes of poor oral vaccine immunogenicity in low-income countries might lead to more effective vaccines we measured mucosal and systemic immune parameters at the time of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine opv in 292 indian infants aged 6-11 months including plasma cytokines leukocyte counts fecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and peripheral blood t-cell phenotype focused on gut-homing regulatory cd4+ populations we did not find a distinct immune phenotype associated with opv immunogenicity although viral pathogens were more prevalent in stool at the time of immunization among infants who failed to seroconvert 63.9% vs 45.6% p = 0.002 using a machine-learning approach we could predict seroconversion a priori using immune parameters and infection status with a median 58% accuracy cross-validation iqr 50-69% compared with 50% expected by chance better identification of immune predictors of opv immunogenicity is likely to require sampling of mucosal tissue and improved oral poliovirus infection models npj vaccines 2020 527 https//doi
still disappointing results from a seductive idea • mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract represent a major portal of entry for most human viruses and a critical component of the mammalian immunologic repertoire the major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin a s-iga the major effector cells in mucosal surfaces however are not iga b cells but t lymphocytes which may account for up to 80% of the mucosal lymphoid cell population • mucosal immunoprophylaxis is theoretically an important approach to control infections acquired through these portals passive antibodies can protect against mucosal viral infections as shown for respiratory syncytial virus but very high quantities of passive antibodies are needed to restrict virus replication on mucosal surface • factors likely to induce mucosal antibody and cell-mediated immune responses include oral or respiratory routes of immunization and active effectively replicating vaccine agents • very few antiviral vaccines have been developed to protect the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract and only an attenuated influenza virus vaccine uses the nasal route other vaccines approved for parenteral use have been administered experimentally by the nasal route these include active replicating and inactive nonreplicating vaccines by this route they induce only a moderate local mucosal response • neither the development of mucosal immunity nor the administration of vaccines via the mucosal route is essential for control or prevention of most respiratory viral infections and diseases acquired through the respiratory tract nonetheless the example of the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine which induces both systemic and local immune response is promising for the future of mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections
bats are a reservoir for a diverse range of viruses including coronaviruses covs to determine the presence of covs in french bats fecal samples were collected between july and august of 2014 from four bat species in seven different locations around the city of bourges in france we present for the first time the presence of alpha-covs in french pipistrellus pipistrellus bat species with an estimated prevalence of 4.2%. based on the analysis of a fragment of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene phylogenetic analyses show that alpha-covs sequences detected in french bats are closely related to other european bat alpha-covs phylogeographic analyses of rdrp sequences show that several covs strains circulate in european bats i old strains detected that have probably diverged a long time ago and are detected in different bat subspecies ii strains detected in myotis and pipistrellus bat species that have more recently diverged our findings support previous observations describing the complexity of the detected covs in bats worldwide
the puppy born without immunoglobulins g igg acquires a passive systemic immunity thanks to colostrum intake during the two first days of life the quality of passive immune transfer i e blood igg concentration at two days of age highly variable between litters and between puppies within litters depends mainly on the time elapsed between birth and ingestion of colostrum with limited influence of colostrum igg concentration deficit in passive immune transfer impacting puppy's health and neonatal mortality rate can be indirectly diagnosed through blood gammaglutamyltransferases assay and evaluation of growth rate over the two first days of life in the absence of maternal colostrum few homo-and heterospecific immune sources are available and canine colostrum banking remains the optimal solution whereas passive immune transfer is crucial for survival during the neonatal period it later interferes with response to vaccination in addition to systemic passive immune transfer maternal antibodies mainly iga would provide local digestive immunity ensuring mid-term protection of the puppies' gut together with probably long term training of the digestive immune system
population of wild boar is increasing in the whole europe the animals migrate close to human habitats which greatly increases the possibility of natural transmission between domestic animals or humans and wild boars the aim of the study was to estimate in population of free-living wild boar in the czech republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens namely rotavirus groups a and c rva and rvc porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and members of family coronaviridae transmissible gastroenteritis virus -tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus à pedv porcine respiratory coronavirus -prcv and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus -phev and picornaviridae teschovirus a -ptv sapelovirus a -psv and enterovirus g -ev-g in our study stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting season 2014-2015 from october to january were examined by rt-pcr rva was detected in 2.5% of tested samples nucleotide analysis of vp7 vp4 and vp6 genes revealed that four rva strains belong to g4pi1 g4pi5 g11pi5 and g5pi5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to porcine and human rvas the prevalence of rvc in wild boar population reached 12.8% ptv was detected in 20.2% psv in 8.9% and ev-g in 2.5% of samples during our study no prrsv or coronaviruses were detected our study provides the first evidence of rvc prevalence in wild boars and indicates that wild boars might contribute to the genetic variability of rva and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses

theoretically homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus cdv the described cell receptor of cdv is slam cd150 attachment of cdv hemagglutinin protein cdv-h to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein cdv-f we investigated whether cdv strains co-evolved in the large homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits comparison of amino acid sequences of the slam binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families using an in vitro assay we quantified syncytia formation mediated by cdv-h proteins from dog and non-dog cdv strains in cells expressing dog lion or cat slam cdv-h proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog slam than with cells expressing lion or cat slam cdv-h proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types but lower values in cells expressing dog slam than the values obtained for cdv-h proteins from dog strains by experimentally changing one amino acid y549h in the cdv-h protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits thereby confirming its functional importance a virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog slam than cells expressing slam of non-dog hosts which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry we provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by cdv strains and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy these findings extend knowledge on cdv molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores
the human body is colonized with a diverse resident microflora that includes viruses recent studies of metagenomes have begun to characterize the composition of the human 'virobiota' and its associated genes the 'virome' and have fostered the emerging field of host-virobiota interactions in this perspective we explore how resident viruses interact with the immune system we review recent findings that highlight the role of the immune system in shaping the composition of the virobiota and consider how resident viruses may impact host immunity finally we discuss the implications of virobiota-immune system interactions for human health the human body is colonized by commensal microorganisms that encompass diverse phyla from the three domains of life eukarya archaea and bacteria most of these microorganisms reside at body surfaces that are in direct contact with the environment including the intestine skin and respiratory tract research efforts over the past two decades have focused primarily on the bacterial component of the human microbiota and its associated genes the 'microbiome'. these efforts have yielded a wealth of insight about the composition of human-associated bacterial communities how these resident bacteria interact with the immune system and how bacteria-immune system interactions are altered in disease 12 .recently it has become apparent that the microbiota of healthy humans also includes viruses termed the 'virobiota' 3 . much of our current knowledge of the virobiota is derived from metagenomics studies in which the dna and sometimes rna content of a microbial community is sequenced 4-6 . these studies have revealed that the human microbiome includes many viral genes the 'virome'. the intestine and the skin for example are both associated with viruses that replicate in eukaryotic cells eukaryotic viruses and viruses that replicate in bacteria bacteriophages or phages 5-7 . the intestinal microbiota also contains viruses that infect plants which are likely associated with the host diet 568 .bacteria that inhabit the intestine and skin are generally regarded as stable residents that confer metabolic and/or immune benefits to their hosts 9 . it is therefore reasonable to ask

attenuated salmonella have been used as vectors to deliver foreign antigens as live vaccines we have previously developed an efficient surface-display system by genetically engineering 987p fimbriae to present transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev c and a epitopes for the induction of anti-tgev antibodies with a salmonella vaccine vector here this system was compared with an autotransporter protein surface display system the tgev c and a epitopes were fused to the passenger domain of the misl autotransporter of salmonella expression of both the misl-and 987p subunit fasa-fusions to the tgev epitopes were under the control of in vivo-induced promoters expression of the tgev epitopes from the salmonella typhimurium cs4552 crp cya asd pgte vaccine strain was greater when the epitopes were fused to misl than when they were fused to the 987p fasa subunit however when balb/c mice were orally immunized with the salmonella vector expressing the tgev epitopes from either one of the fusion constructs or both together the highest level of anti-tgev antibody was obtained with the 987p-tgev immunogen-displaying vector this result suggested that better immune responses towards specific epitopes could be obtained by using a polymeric display system such as fimbriae
worldwide diarrhea outbreaks in cattle herds are more frequently detected in calves being that diarrhea outbreaks in adult cattle are not common winter dysentery wd is a bovine coronavirus bcov enteric infection that is more reported in northern hemisphere seasonal outbreaks of wd in adult cattle occur mainly in dairy cows wd has not been described in beef cattle herds of tropical countries this study describes the molecular detection of bcov in a diarrhea outbreak in beef cattle steers nellore raised on pasture in parana southern brazil during the outbreak the farm had about 600 fattening steers watery and bloody diarrhea unresponsive to systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reveals a morbidity rate of approximately 15 %. the bcov n gene was identified in 42.9 % 6/14 of the diarrheic fecal samples evaluated by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction sn-pcr technique other enteric microorganisms occasionally identified in adult cattle and evaluated in this study such as bovine groups a b and c rotavirus bovine viral diarrhea virus bovine torovirus aichivirus b and eimeria sp were not identified in the fecal samples to the best knowledge of the authors this is the first description of the bcov diagnosis in fecal samples collected in a diarrhea outbreak in adult beef cattle grazing in the grass in a tropical country
poxviruses are important pathogens of man and numerous domestic and wild animal species cross species including zoonotic poxvirus infections can have drastic consequences for the recipient host bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry lethal viral zoonoses such as rabies hendra nipah and sars consequent targeted research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were dramatically different here we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the poxviridae family in addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses we reflect on the broader implications of these findings specifically the potential to explore and exploit this newfound relationship to study coevolution and cross species transmission together with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism as well as bat virology and immunology
background foot-and-mouth disease fmd is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective it may lead to a new outbreak of fmd because of either incomplete inactivation of fmdv or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop thus it is urgent to develop a novel fmdv vaccine that is safer more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines methodology and principal findings a recombinant silkworm baculovirus bm-p12a3c which contained the intact p1-2a and 3c protease coding regions of fmdv asia 1/hnk/cha/05 was developed indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-elisa were used to verify that bm-p12a3c could express the target cassette expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals after challenge with virulent homologous virus four of the five animals were completely protected and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one furthermore a pd 50 50% bovine protective dose test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine the result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 pd 50 per dose the results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit fmdv vaccine

autoradiographic methods can be used as an alternative to indirect immunofluorescence to detect viral antigen expression or the presence of igg in tissue sections iodinated protein a isolated from staphylococcus aureus detects an influx of lgg into the central nervous system of mice inoculated with the coronavirus sd antispecies antibody that has been iodinated detects coronavirus antigen expression for 24 days post-inoculation while it is only detectable for 10 days by immunofluorescence a direct comparison of indirect fluorescence and autoradiographic methods indicates that the autoradiographic techniques are considerably more sensitive this increased sensitivity is sufficient to permit the detection of viral antigen in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections
background the use of biomaterials has been expanded to improve the characteristics of vaccines recently we have identified that the peptide ph 1-110 from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles we have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines however the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized in addition the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated results in the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines these particles are purified easily by centrifugation immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature preserving their immunological properties the rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases the thermostability conferred by the particle system facilitates the distribution of the vaccines in developing countries or areas with no electricity

bats are unique mammals exhibit distinctive life history traits and have unique immunological approaches to suppression of viral diseases upon infection high-throughput next-generation sequencing has been used in characterizing the virome of different bat species the cave nectar bat eonycteris spelaea has a broad geographical range across southeast asia india and southern china however little is known about their involvement in virus transmission here we investigate the diversity and abundance of viral communities from a colony of eonycteris spelaea residing in singapore our results detected 47 and 22 different virus families from bat fecal and urine samples respectively among these we identify a large number of virus families including adenoviridae flaviviridae reoviridae papillomaviridae paramyxoviridae parvoviridae picornaviridae and polyomaviridae in most cases viral sequences from eonycteris spelaea are genetically related to a group of bat viruses from other bat genera e g eidolon miniopterus rhinolophus and rousettus the results of this study improve our knowledge of the host range spread and evolution of several important viral pathogens more significantly our findings provide a baseline to study the temporal patterns of virus shedding and how they correlate with bat phenological trends
diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of deaths in children a limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens in cameroon and as in many other african countries the cause of many diarrheal episodes remains unexplained a proportion of these unknown cases of diarrhea are likely caused by yet-unidentified viral agents some of which could be the result of recent interspecies transmission from animal reservoirs like bats using viral metagenomics we screened fecal samples of 221 humans almost all with gastroenteritis symptoms between 0 and 89 years of age with different degrees of bat contact we identified viruses belonging to families that are known to cause gastroenteritis such as adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae interestingly a mammalian orthoreovirus picobirnaviruses a smacovirus and a pecovirus were also found although there was no evidence of interspecies transmission of the most common human gastroenteritis-related viruses astroviridae caliciviridae and reoviridae the phylogenies of the identified orthoreovirus picobirnavirus and smacovirus indicate a genetic relatedness of these viruses identified in stools of humans and those of bats and/or other animals these findings points out the possibility of interspecies transmission or simply a shared host of these viruses bacterial fungal parasitic . . . present in both animals bats and humans further screening of bat viruses in humans or vice versa will elucidate the epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses to human health furthermore this study showed a huge diversity of highly divergent novel phages thereby expanding the existing phageome considerably
studies have demonstrated that~60%-80% of emerging infectious diseases eids in humans originated from wild life bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals however the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear which complicates the determination of the origins of certain eids here using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout china the purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health the data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified this genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses such as coronaviruses and noroviruses these data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated eids
in 2013 ped emerged for the first time in the united states us the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv spread quickly throughout north america infection with pedv causes watery diarrhea and up to 100% mortality in piglets particularly for highly pathogenic non-indel strains circulating in the us pedv is mainly transmitted by the fecal-oral route transmission via the venereal route has been suspected but not previously investigated the aim of the study was to determine if pedv could be detected in semen from infected specific pathogen-free spf boars inoculated with a pedv us non-indel strain suggesting venereal transmission may occur two boars orally inoculated with pedv showed clinical signs and virus shedding in feces transient presence of the pedv genome was detected by rt-qpcr in the seminal 5.06 × 10 2 to 2.44 × 10 3 genomic copies/ml and sperm-rich fraction of semen 5.64 × 10 2 to 3.40 × 10 4 genomic copies/ml and a longer duration of viral shedding was observed in the sperm-rich fraction the evidence of pedv shedding in semen raises new questions in term of disease spread within the pig population with the use of potentially contaminated semen
the hendra virus hev poses a significant challenge to public health in australia expanding migratory patterns observed among bats and the mutation of the virus to seek and successfully infect new hosts is a significant departure from the generalized epidemiological trend the recent discovery of equine-related infections and deaths in addition to a canine infection demonstrates the inadequacy of the current equine vaccine developed in 2012 traditional models for controlling the spread of the vector are futile given the rapid pace at which bats' habitats are eroded recent ongoing zoonotic epidemics for example ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus demonstrate that human-to-human transmission is a distinct reality rather than an obscure possibility the development of a human hev vaccine is essential for the biosecurity of australia as part of a multipronged strategy to control hev in australia
development of necrotizing enterocolitis nec requires a susceptible host typically a premature infant or an infant with congenital heart disease enteral feedings and bacterial colonization although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of nec the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive unlike established normal adult gut microbiota which is quite complex uniform and stable early postnatal bacterial populations are simple diverse and fluid these properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of nec a broad variety of bacterial viral and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental nec frequently however the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals clustered outbreaks of nec in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest but do not prove a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease studies in cronobacter sakazakii the best characterized nec pathogen have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole but rather a characteristic of certain strains which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic the fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in nec progress in understanding the infectious nature of nec may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models
bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses such as hendra virus nipah virus ebola virus marburg virus rabies and other lyssaviruses recently a large number of viruses closely related to members of the genus coronavirus have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and detected in bat species in this study samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species from 27 different locations in slovenia coronaviruses were detected by rt-pcr in 14 out of 36 horseshoe bat rhinolophus hipposideros fecal samples with 38.8% virus prevalence sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved rna polymerase gene pol showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses the most closely related virus sequence in genbank was sars bat isolate rp3/2004 dq071615 within the sars-like cov cluster sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity the potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed
the family arenaviridae genus arenavirus consists of two phylogenetically independent groups old world ow and new world nw complexes the lassa and lujo viruses in the ow complex and the guanarito junin machupo sabia and chapare viruses in the nw complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever vhf in humans leading to serious public health concerns these viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents therefore it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically in order to minimize the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks however these arenaviruses are classified as bsl-4 pathogens thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without bsl-4 facilities to overcome these difficulties antibody detection systems in the form of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins rnps derived from these viruses furthermore several antigen-detection assays were developed for example novel monoclonal antibodies mabs to the rnps of lassa and junin viruses were generated sandwich antigen-capture ag-capture elisas using these mabs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus nps these rnp-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of vhfs but also for seroepidemiological studies on vhfs we recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins the goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viralviruses 2012 4 2098 proteins for the diagnosis of vhfs and epidemiological studies on the vhfs caused by arenaviruses
the employment of live attenuated vaccines has a long-standing record in human and veterinary medicine most of the vaccines in current use were empirically developed during the last century today due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible moreover live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors in each case the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity antigen synthesis antigen release and safety aspects have to be integrated a range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics but very few have been approved so far in many cases further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles in the present chapter we focus on current strategies which are employed for the development of new and the optimization of first generation recombinant live vaccines based on bacteria and viruses
coronavirus sars-cov inactivated sars-cov has been explored as a vaccine against sars-cov however safe and potent adjuvants especially with more efficient and economical needle-free vaccination are always needed more urgently in a pandemic the development of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant and vaccine for prevention of emergent infectious diseases such as sars will be an important advancement pika a stabilized derivative of poly ic was previously reported to be safe and potent as adjuvant in mouse models in the present study we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated sars-cov vaccine together with this improved poly ic derivative induced strong anti-sars-cov mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated sars-cov vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites co-administration of inactivated sars-cov vaccine with pika as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity when intranasal immunization was used pika was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal iga and mucosal igg response overall pika could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated sars-cov vaccine for use in possible future pandemic
seven monoclonal antibodies mabs with neutralizing activity against feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv strain 79-1149 type ii were prepared when the polypeptide specificity recognized by these monoclonal antibodies mabs was investigated by western immunoblotting all of the mabs reacted with peplomer glycoprotein s of the virus by competitive binding assay these mabs were found to recognize at least 3 different epitopes the reactivity of these mabs with 6 viruses classified as fipv type i ucd-1 ucd-2 ucd-3 ucd-4 nw-1 and black feline enteric coronavirus fecv type ii strain 79-1683 canine coronavirus ccv strain 1-71 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev strains to-163 and sh was examined by neutralization tests all mabs neutralized fecv strain 79-1683 ccv strain 1-71 and tgev strains to-163 and sh while they did not neutralize the 6 fipv type i viruses moreover the mab against tgev strain to-163 which has strong neutralizing activity against 7 tgev viruses neutralized ccv strain 1-71 fecv strain 79-1683 and fipv strain 79-1146 but did not neutralize the 6 fipv type i viruses these results demonstrated that there are at least 3 epitopes involved in the neutralization of fipv type ii strain 79-1146 and that these epitopes are not present in fipv type i viruses but are present in fecv strain 79'-1683 which does not induce feline infectious peritonitis tgev strains to-163 and sh and ccv strain 1-71 these results suggest the presence of 2 serotypes of fipv which can be clearly distinguished by the neutralization test using mabs
recombinant measles viruses rmv based on the live attenuated measles vaccine strain mvb expressing antigens of hiv-1 clade b were generated by reverse genetics recombinants expressing single or double antigens of hiv-1 rmv-hiv were genetically highly stable on human diploid cells the production process of these viruses was essentially similar to the parental mv strain yielding comparative end titers immunization of tg-mice by different regimens and formulations showed potent humoral and cellular immune responses against mv and hiv antigens recombinant mv-hiv expressing gag protein conferred protective immunity in tg-mice after a high-dose pseudochallenge with recombinant vaccinia virus in addition rmv-hiv boosted anti-hiv antibodies in the presence of pre-existing anti-vector antibodies
this review provides a comparison of the theoretical issues and experimental findings for plasmid dna and mrna vaccine technologies while both have been under development since the 1990s in recent years significant excitement has turned to mrna despite the licensure of several veterinary dna vaccines both have required efforts to increase their potency either via manipulating the plasmid dna and the mrna directly or through the addition of adjuvants or immunomodulators as well as delivery systems and formulations the greater inherent inflammatory nature of the mrna vaccines is discussed for both its potential immunological utility for vaccines and for the potential toxicity the status of the clinical trials of mrna vaccines is described along with a comparison to dna vaccines specifically the immunogenicity of both licensed veterinary dna vaccines and select dna vaccine candidates in human clinical trials

canine morbillivirus canine distemper virus cdv persists as a serious threat to the health of domestic dogs and wildlife although studies have been conducted on the frequency and risk factors associated with cdv infection there are no comprehensive data on the current epidemiological magnitude in the domestic dog population at regional and national levels therefore we conducted a cross-sectional study and included our results in a meta-analysis to summarize and combine available data on the frequency and potential risk factors associated with cdv infection for the cross-sectional study biological samples from dogs suspected to have canine distemper cd were collected and screened for viral rna briefly the prisma protocol was used for the meta-analysis and data analyses were performed using stata ic 13.1 software cdv rna was detected in 34% 48/141 of dogs suspected to have cd following our meta-analysis 53 studies were selected for a total of 11527 dogs overall the pooled frequency of cdv positivity based on molecular and serological results were 33% 95% ci 23-43 and 46% 95% ci 36-57 respectively the pooled subgroup analyses of clinical signs types of biological samples diagnostic methods and dog lifestyle had a wide range of cdv positivity range 8-75%. free-ranging dogs or 1.44 95% ci 1.05-1.97 dogs >24 months old or 1.83 95% ci 1.1-3 and unvaccinated dogs or 2.92 95% ci 1.26-6.77 were found to be positively associated with cdv infection in contrast dogs <12 months old or 0.36 95% ci 0.20-0.64 and dogs with a complete anti-cdv vaccination or 0.18 95% ci 0.05-0.59 had a negative association
small-scale biogas digesters are widely promoted worldwide as a sustainable technology to manage livestock manure in vietnam pig slurry is commonly applied to biogas digesters for production of gas for electricity and cooking with the effluent being used to fertilize field crops vegetables and fish ponds slurry may contain a variety of zoonotic pathogens e g salmonella spp which are able to cause disease in humans either through direct contact with slurry or by fecal contamination of water and foods the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of salmonella spp and the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci e coli and spores of clostridium perfringens in biogas digesters operated by small-scale vietnamese pig farmers the serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility of the salmonella spp isolated were also established the study was conducted in 12 farms 6 farms with and 6 farms without toilet connected located in hanam province vietnam sampling of pig slurry and biogas effluent was done during two seasons results showed that the concentration of enterococci e coli and clostridium perfringens spores was overall reduced by only 1-2 log 10 -units in the biogas digesters when comparing raw slurry and biogas effluent salmonella spp was found in both raw slurry and biogas effluent a total of 19 salmonella serovars were identified with the main serovars being salmonella typhimurium 55/138 salmonella enterica serovar 412i-19/138 salmonella weltevreden 9/138 and salmonella rissen 9/138 the salmonella serovars showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns to those previously reported from vietnam when promoting biogas farmers should be made aware that effluent should only be used as fertilizer for crops not consumed raw and that indiscriminate discharge of effluent are likely to contaminate water recipients e g drinking water sources with pathogens relevant authorities should promote safe animal manure management practices to farmers and regulations be updated to ensure food safety and public health
diarrhea is an important cause of morbidity in neonatal llamas and alpacas diarrhea may be multifactorial in etiology including management and nutritional factors as well as a variety of pathogens most of the pathogens involved affect other livestock species and some have host-adapted strains however the clinical signs their expected severity and age of onset of disease varies between species in some cases the most common pathogens causing diarrhea in neonatal camelids are coronavirus escherichia coli e coli cryptosporidium spp giardia spp and coccidia the purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on neonatal diarrhea in camelids and to present clinical data from 55 cases seen at the ohio state university
modified vaccinia virus ankara mva is a highly attenuated and replication-deficient virus serving as vaccine against infectious diseases here we assessed the in vivo distribution of a recombinant mva candidate vaccine against the middle eastern respiratory syndrome mva-mers-s in mice intramuscularly inoculated mice were necropsied at different time points and examined by histology immunohistochemistry and real-time pcr we detected inflammation and myonecrosis at the parenteral site and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes mva-mers-s did not result in detectable lesions in tissues peripheral to the parenteral site and draining lymph nodes real-time pcr analysis of > 240 tissue samples detected mva-dna predominantly at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes and suggested continuous clearance of the candidate vaccine during the observation period levels of parenteral site inflammation and hyperplasia of draining lymph nodes were considered in line with immunological responses to vaccine inoculation
feline immunodeficiency virus fiv infection has been the focus of several studies because this virus exhibits genetic and pathogenic characteristics that are similar to those of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv fiv causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids in cats nevertheless a large fraction of infected cats remain asymptomatic throughout life despite of persistent chronic infection this slow disease progression may be due to the presence of factors that are involved in the natural resistance to infection and the immune response that is mounted by the animals as well as due to the adaptation of the virus to the host therefore the study of virus-host interaction is essential to the understanding of the different patterns of disease course and the virus persistence in the host and to help with the development of effective vaccines and perhaps the cure of fiv and hiv infections
the antigenicity and protective effect of 3 strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus inactivated by beta-propiolactone were studied chickens administered 2 doses of the inactivated connecticut strain ibv-46 vaccine by aerosol at 3-week intervals had significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies and were resistant to infection by the massachusetts strain ibv-41 as determined by virus isolation attempts antibody levels in chickens given inactivated iowa 33 and iowa 609 were not significant and they were not resistant to infection by ibv-41
zika virus zikv infection can cause severe congenital diseases such as microcephaly ocular defects and arthrogryposis in fetuses and guillain-barré syndrome in adults efficacious therapeutic treatments for infected patients as well as prophylactic treatments to prevent new infections are needed for combating zikv infection here we report that zikv-specific human polyclonal antibodies sab-155 elicited in transchromosomal bovine tcb provide significant protection from infection by zikv in stat2 knockout ko golden syrian hamsters both prophylactically and therapeutically these antibodies also prevent testicular lesions in this hamster model our data indicate that antibody-mediated immunotherapy is effective in treating zikv infection because suitable quantities of highly potent human polyclonal antibodies can be quickly produced from the tcb system against zikv and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a small animal model they have the potential as an effective countermeasure against zikv infection
in order to evaluate sheep as experimental model to test the efficacy of hobi-like pestivirus vaccines for cattle 10 sheep at different stages of pregnancy 30 or 50 days were experimentally infected with the italian prototype isolate italy-1/10-1 irrespective of the stage of pregnancy virus inoculation resulted in reproductive failures consisting of abortion stillbirths or birth of weak or persistently infected pi lambs aborted fetuses stillborn and dead lambs displayed extensive histopathological changes consisting of hemorrhages congestion and mononuclear infiltration in major organs pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys pi lambs were constantly viremic shed the virus through the nasal secretions and feces and in all cases but one did not have detectable hobi-like pestivirus antibodies before the assumption of colostrum the single seropositive infected lamb showed low-titer viremia and viral shedding that ceased only several weeks after the 3-month observation period the study proves that sheep are susceptible to the reproduction failures caused by hobi-like pestivirus infection and can serve as a suitable model for the evaluation of the fetal protection induced by homologous experimental vaccines

zika virus zikv infection remains a serious health threat due to its close association with congenital zika syndrome czs which includes microcephaly and other severe birth defects as no vaccines are available for human use continuous effort is needed to develop effective and safe vaccines to prevent zikv infection in this study we constructed three recombinant proteins comprising respectively residues 296-406 e296-406 298-409 e298-409 and 301-404 e301-404 of zikv envelope e protein domain iii ediii fused with a c-terminal fc of human igg our results demonstrated that e298-409 induced the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection with nine zikv strains isolated from different hosts countries and time periods and it maintained long-term anti-zikv immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies pups born to mice immunized with e298-409 were fully protected against lethal challenge with two epidemic human zikv strains 2015/honduras r103451 and 2015/colombia flr passive transfer of anti-e298-409 mouse sera protected pups born to naive mice as well as type i interferon receptordeficient adult a129 mice from lethal challenge with human zikv strains r103451 and flr and this protection was positively correlated with neutralizing antibodies these data suggest that the critical neutralizing fragment i e a fragment that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent zikv strains of zikv ediii is a good candidate for development as an effective and safe zikv subunit vaccine to protect pregnant mothers and their fetuses against zikv infection the e298-409-specific antibodies can be used for passive immunization to prevent zikv infection in newborns or immunocompromised adults
respiratory viruses infections caused by influenza viruses human parainfluenza virus hpiv respiratory syncytial virus rsv and coronaviruses are an eminent threat for public health currently there are no licensed vaccines available for hpiv rsv and coronaviruses and the available seasonal influenza vaccines have considerable limitations with regard to pandemic preparedness it is important that procedures are in place to respond rapidly and produce tailor made vaccines against these respiratory viruses on short notice moreover especially for influenza there is great need for the development of a universal vaccine that induces broad protective immunity against influenza viruses of various subtypes modified vaccinia virus ankara mva is a replication-deficient viral vector that holds great promise as a vaccine platform mva can encode one or more foreign antigens and thus functions as a multivalent vaccine the vector can be used at biosafety level 1 has intrinsic adjuvant capacities and induces humoral and cellular immune responses however there are some practical and regulatory issues that need to beviruses 2014 6 2736 addressed in order to develop mva-based vaccines on short notice at the verge of a pandemic in this review we discuss promising novel influenza virus vaccine targets and the use of mva for vaccine development against various respiratory viruses
chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the member of the togaviridae family belongs to the genus alphavirus making it a major threat in all developing countries as well as some developed countries the mosquito acts as a vector for the disease and carries the chik-virus to date there is no direct treatment available and that demands the development of more effective vaccines in this study author employed immune epitope database and analysis resource a machine learningbased algorithm principally working on the artificial neural network ann algorithm also known as iedb-ann for the prediction and analysis of epitopes a total of 173 epitopes were identified on the basis of ic50 values among them 40 epitopes were found sharing part with the linear b-cell epitopes and exposed to the ctap1protein and out of 40 6 epitopes were noticed to show interactions with the ctap with their binding energy ranging from − 3.61 to − 1.22 kcal/mol the six epitopes identified were exposed to the hla class i alleles and from this all revealed interaction with the hla alleles and minimum binding energy that ranges from − 4.12 to − 5.88 kcal/mol besides two t cell epitopes i e 145 kvftgvype 153 and 395 stvpvappr 403 were found most promiscuous candidates these promiscuous epitopes-hla complexes were further analyzed by the molecular dynamics simulation to check the stability of the complex results obtained from this study suggest that the identified epitopes i e and 395 stvpvappr 403 are likely to be capable of passing through the lumen of er to bind withthe hla class i allele and provide new insights and potential application in the designing and development of peptide-based vaccine candidate for the treatment of chikungunya publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
the aim of the present study was to carry out molecular epidemiological investigation on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec k99 and salmonella spp in diarrheic neonatal calves fecal samples were obtained from 220 diarrheic calves at 9 farms related to four governorates in central and northern egypt e coli and salmonella spp isolates were examined for e coli k99 and salmonella spp using pcr etec k99 was recovered from 20 10.36 % out of 193 isolates whereas salmonella spp was recovered from nine calves 4.09%.multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with both infections etec k99 was significantly affected by age p < 0.01 or 1.812 ci 95% 0.566-1.769 colostrum feeding practice p < 0.01 or 5.525 ci 95% 2.025-15.076 rotavirus infection p < 0.001 or 2.220 ci 95% 0.273-1.251 vaccination of pregnant dams with combined vaccine against rotavirus coronavirus and e coli k99 p < 0.001 or 4.753 ci 95% 2.124-10.641 and vitamin e and selenium administration to the pregnant dam p < 0.01 or 3.933 ci 95% 0.703-1.248 infection with salmonella spp was found to be significantly affected by the animal age p < 0.05 or 0.376 ci 95% 0.511-1.369 hygiene p < 0.05 or 0.628 ci 95% 1.729-5.612 and region p < 0 01 or 0.970 ci 95% 0.841-1.624 the results of the present study indicate the importance of pcr as rapid effective and reliable tool for screening of etec and salmonella spp when confronted with cases of undifferentiated calf diarrhea moreover identification of the risk factors associated with the spreading of bacteria causing diarrhea may be helpful for construction of suitable methods for prevention and control
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes diarrhea in all ages of pigs with 50-100% mortality rates in neonatal piglets in the united states inactivated and subunit pedv vaccines for pregnant sows are available but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from pedv naïve sows a safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed in this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated pedv vaccine candidates the emerging non-s indel pedv strain pc22a at the 100th cell culture passage level -clone no 4 p100c4 and at the 120th passage level p120 in weaned pigs results four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with pedv pc22a-p3 virulent -p100c4 -p120 and mock respectively and challenged with the p3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation dpi after inoculation p3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral rna shedding p100c4 and p120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs although viral rna was detected in feces of all pigs except for one p100c4-inoculated pig compared with the p120 group p3-and p100c4-inoculated pigs had higher serum pedv-specific igg and viral neutralizing vn antibody ab titers at 14 dpi after the challenge no pigs in the p3 group but all pigs in the p100c4 p120 and mock groups had diarrhea compared with the p120 group pigs in the p100c4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal pedv rna shedding titers higher titers of serum pedv-specific igg iga and vn abs and higher numbers of intestinal iga ab-secreting cells conclusions pedv pc22a p100c4 and p120 were fully attenuated in weaned pigs but failed to elicit protection against virulent p3 challenge p100c4 induced higher pedv-specific antibody responses than p120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge therefore p100c4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics it also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a pedv vaccination regimen whose efficacy can be tested in the future
currently available rabies post-exposure prophylaxis pep for use in humans includes equine or human rabies immunoglobulins rig the replacement of rig with an equally or more potent and safer product is strongly encouraged due to the high costs and limited availability of existing rig in this study we identified two broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that represent a valid and affordable alternative to rig in rabies pep memory b cells from four selected vaccinated donors were immortalized and monoclonal antibodies were tested for neutralizing activity and epitope specificity two antibodies identified as rvc20 and rvc58 binding to antigenic site i and iii respectively were selected for their potency and broad-spectrum reactivity in vitro rvc20 and rvc58 were able to neutralize all 35 rabies virus rabv and 25 non-rabv lyssaviruses they showed higher potency and breath compared to antibodies under clinical development namely cr57 cr4098 and rab1 and commercially available human rig in vivo the rvc20-rvc58 cocktail protected syrian hamsters from a lethal rabv challenge and did not affect the endogenous hamster post-vaccination antibody response
the contribution of lactogenic antibody to the protection of piglets against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was evaluated pregnant multiparous sows and their litters were allocated to one of 3 treatment groups group 1-6 serum antibody-negative sows and a subset n = 11 of their piglets group 2-8 serum antibody-positive sows and their 91 piglets piglets were orally inoculated with pedv at 4 group 1 or 2 group 2 days of age group 3-2 pedv serum antibody-negative sows and 22 piglets provided a baseline for piglet survivability and growth rate piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs body weight and body temperature through day post-inoculation dpi 12 groups 2 and 3 or 14 group 1 serum and mammary secretions were tested for pedv igg iga and virus-neutralizing antibody feces were tested by pedv real-time reverse transcriptase pcr rrt-pcr piglets on sows without group 1 or with group 2 anti-pedv antibody showed significantly different responses to pedv infection in virus shedding p < 0.05 thermoregulation p < 0.05 growth rate p < 0.05 and survivability p < 0.0001 specifically group 1 piglets shed more virus on dpis 1 to 5 were hypothermic at all sampling points except dpis 9 11 and 12 gained weight more slowly and exhibited lower survivability than group 2 piglets within group 2 litters significant differences were found in virus shedding p < 0.05 and body temperature p < 0.05 but not in piglet survival rate the number of sows and litters in group 2 was insufficient to derive the relationship between specific levels of lactogenic antibody ffn iga and igg and the amelioration of clinical effects however when combined with previous pedv literature it can be concluded that the optimal protection to piglets will be provided by dams able to deliver sufficient lactogenic immunity both humoral and cellular to their offspring

hemorrhagic fever in humans the geographic range of human cchf cases largely reflects the presence of ticks however highly similar cchfv lineages occur in geographically distant regions tick-infested migratory birds have been suggested but not confirmed to contribute to the dispersal bats have recently been shown to carry nairoviruses distinct from cchfv in order to assess the presence of cchfv in a wide range of bat species over a wide geographic range we analyzed 1135 sera from 16 different bat species collected in congo gabon ghana germany and panama using a cchfv glycoproteinbased indirect immunofluorescence test iift we identified reactive antibodies in 10.0% 114/1135 of tested bats pertaining to 12/16 tested species depending on the species 3.6%-42.9% of cave-dwelling bats and 0.6%-7.1% of foliage-living bats were seropositive two-tailed t-test p = 0.0447 cave versus foliage 11/30 iift-reactive sera from 10 different african bat species had neutralizing activity in a viruslike particle assay neutralization of full cchfv was confirmed in 5 of 7 sera widespread infection of cave-dwelling bats may indicate a role for bats in the life cycle and geographic dispersal of cchfv
has emerged and prevailed in mainland china affecting over 2 million pigs commercial prrsv killed and modified live vaccines cannot provide complete protection against hp-prrsv due to genetic variation development of more effective vaccines against the emerging hp-prrsv is urgently required in our previous studies two formulations of dna vaccines pcdna3.1-poifn-λ1-synorf5 and bpei/plga-synorf5 based on the hp-prrsv were constructed and shown to induce enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice the objective of this study was to evaluate the immune response induced by these novel formulations in piglets pcdna3.1-poifn-λ1-synorf5 and bpei/ plga-synorf5 vaccines induced significantly enhanced gp5-specific antibody and prrsv-specific neutralizing antibody in pigs compared with the pcdna3.1-synorf5 parental construct though ifn-γ levels and lymphocyte proliferation responses induced by the two dna vaccine formulations were comparable to that induced by the pcdna3.1-synorf5 construct each of the novel formulations provided efficient protection against challenge with hp-prrsv non-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with bpei/plga-synorf5 compared with other groups thus these novel dna constructs may represent promising candidate vaccines against emerging hp-prrsv
the recent ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the therapeutic potential of antisera and renewed interest in this treatment approach while human convalescent sera may not be readily available in the early stages of an outbreak antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame here we compared adjuvanted virus-like particles vlp with recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv both expressing the ebola virus antigens the neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted vlps were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent vsv indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies this approach also yielded high-titer antisera against nipah virus glycoproteins illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families multiple-step immunoglobulin g purification using a two-step 20-40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein a affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability adjuvanted vlp-based immunization strategies are thus a promising approach for the rapid generation of therapeutic antisera against emerging infections

mycoplasma hyopneumoniae the primary pathogen of enzootic pneumonia occurs worldwide and causes major economic losses to the pig industry the organism adheres to and damages the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract affected pigs show chronic coughing are more susceptible to other respiratory infections and have a reduced performance control of the disease can be accomplished in a number of ways first management practices and housing conditions in the herd should be optimized these include all-in/all-out production limiting factors that may destabilize herd immunity maintaining optimal stocking densities prevention of other respiratory diseases and optimal housing and climatic conditions strategic medication with antimicrobials active against m hyopneumoniae and preferably also against major secondary bacteria may be useful during periods when the pigs are at risk for respiratory disease finally commercial bacterins are widely used to control m hyopneumoniae infections the main effects of vaccination include less clinical symptoms lung lesions and medication use and improved performance however bacterins provide only partial protection and do not prevent colonization of the organism different vaccination strategies timing of vaccination vaccination of sows vaccination combined with antimicrobial medication can be used depending on the type of herd the production system and management practices the infection pattern and the preferences of the pig producer research on new vaccines is actively occurring including aerosol and feed-based vaccines as well as subunit and dna vaccines eradication of the infection at herd level based on age-segregation and medication is possible but there is a permanent risk for re-infections #
a 73-year-old man was confirmed to have an influenza a h7n9 virus infection and the causative agent a/beijing/02/2014h7n9 virus was isolated genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the virus belonged to a novel genotype which probably emerged and further reassorted with other h9 or h7 viruses in poultry before transmitting to humans this virus caused a severe infection with high levels of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies eventually the patient was cured after serially combined treatments taken together our findings indicated that this novel genotype of the human h7n9 virus did not evolve directly from the first beijing isolate a/beijing/01/2013h7n9 suggesting that the h7n9 virus has not obtained the ability for human-to-human transmissibility and the virus only evolves in poultry and then infects human by direct contact hence the major measures to prevent human h7n9 virus infection are still to control and standardize the live poultry trade early antiviral treatment with combination therapies including mechanical ventilation nutrition support and symptomatic treatment are effective for h7n9 infection
the mammarenavirus genus includes several pathogenic species of rodent-borne viruses old world ow mammarenaviruses infect rodents in the murinae subfamily and are mainly transmitted in africa and asia new world nw mammarenaviruses are found in rodents of the cricetidae subfamily in the americas we applied a selection-informed method to estimate that ow and nw mammarenaviruses diverged less than $45000 years ago ya by incorporating phylogeographic inference we show that nw mammarenaviruses emerged in the latin america-caribbean region $41400-3300 ya whereas ow mammarenaviruses originated $23100-1880 ya most likely in southern africa cophylogenetic analysis indicated that cospeciation did not contribute significantly to mammarenavirus-host associations finally we show that extremely strong selective pressure on the viral polymerase accompanied the speciation of nw viruses these data suggest that the evolutionary history of mammarenaviruses was not driven by codivergence with their hosts the viral polymerase should be regarded as a major determinant of mammarenavirus adaptation
bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for several potentially zoonotic viruses recently astroviruses have been reported in bats in many countries but not korea we collected 363 bat samples from thirteen species at twenty-nine sites in korea across 2016 and tested them for astrovirus the detection of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene in bat astroviruses was confirmed in thirty-four bats across four bat species in korea twenty-five from miniopterus fuliginosusi one from myotis macrodactylus four from m petax and four from rhinolophus ferrumequinum the highest detection rates for astrovirus were found in sunchang 61.5% 8/13 bats and in the samples collected in april 63.2% 12/19 bats the amino acid identity of astroviral sequences identified from bat samples was ≥ 46.6%. more specifically the amino acid identity within multiple clones from individual bats was ≥ 50.8%. additionally the phylogenetic topology between astroviruses from different bat families showed a close relationship furthermore phylogenetic analysis of the partial orf2 sequence of bat astroviruses was found to have a maximum similarity of 73.3-74.8% with available bat astrovirus sequences these results indicate potential multiple-infection by several bat astrovirus species in individual bats or hyperpolymorphism in the astrovirus strains as well as the transmission of astroviruses across bat families furthermore our phylogenetic analysis of the partial orf2 implied that a novel astrovirus may exist however the wide diversity of astroviral sequences appeared to have no significant correlation with bat species or the spatiotemporal distribution of korean bat astroviruses
the ongoing battle against current and rising viral infectious threats has prompted increasing effort in the development of vaccine technology a major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing herein a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles svlps is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen svlps were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins following removal of free proteins antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy as compared to inoculation with free proteins vaccination with the svlps showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery stronger antibody titers increased splenic t-cell response and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the svlps the study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture

• this is the first report on the prevalence of salmonella yersinia and campylobacter spp in feral raccoons and masked palm civets in japan • our results indicate that these animals are potential carriers of these pathogens and that these animals probably acquired their infections from human activities other wild animals and the environment • as these animals live near human habitations or livestock farms their carrying the pathogens represents a serious public and animal health risk
influenza viruses since time immemorial have been the major respiratory pathogen known to infect a wide variety of animals birds and reptiles with established lineages they belong to the family orthomyxoviridae and cause acute respiratory illness often during local outbreaks or seasonal epidemics and occasionally during pandemics recent studies have identified a new genus within the orthomyxoviridae family this newly identified pathogen d/swine/oklahoma/1334/2011 d/ok first identified in pigs with influenza-like illness was classified as the influenza d virus idv which is distantly related to the previously characterized human influenza c virus several other back-to-back studies soon suggested cattle as the natural reservoir and possible involvement of idv in the bovine respiratory disease complex was established not much is known about its likelihood to cause disease in humans but it definitely poses a potential threat as an emerging pathogen in cattle-workers here we review the evolution epidemiology virology and pathobiology of influenza d virus and the possibility of transmission among various hosts and potential to cause human disease
the use of vaccines is an effective and relatively inexpensive means of controlling infectious diseases which cause heavy economic losses to the livestock industry through animal loss decreased productivity treatment expenses and decreased carcass quality however some vaccines produced by conventional means are imperfect in many respects including virulence safety and efficacy moreover there are no vaccines for some animal diseases although genetic engineering has provided new ways of producing effective vaccines the cost of production for veterinary use is a critical criterion for selecting the method of production and delivery of vaccines the cost effective production and intrinsic ability to enter cells has made adenovirus vectors a highly efficient tool for delivery of vaccine antigens moreover adenoviruses induce both humoral and cellular immune responses to expressed vaccine antigens since nonhuman adenoviruses are species specific the development of animal specific adenoviruses as vaccine delivery vectors is being evaluated this review summarizes the work related to the development of bovine adenovirus-3 as a vaccine delivery vehicle in animals particularly cattle

do stress hormones such as corticosterone enhance bird susceptibility to mosquitoes in ways that enhance rates of coinfection does this then enhance pathogen emergenceinteractions between pathogens are often mediated by the hosts immune system . two recent experimental papers suggest that interactions between the immune system and corticosterone may be important in mediating synergistic interactions between pathogens that enhance rates of co-infection in birds as part of a long term study on the effect of the bacterial pathogen mycoplasma gallisepticum in house finches haemorhous mexicanus dana hawley and her team asked the question to what extent are the stress hormones that are important for energy mobilization and regulation of the immune system influenced by experimental infection with the bacterium m gallisepticum . they found that corticosterone levels increased after house finches were infected with m gallisepticum decreased again to pre-infection levels once the infection was cleared and that individuals with greater disease severity had the highest corticosterone concentrations trying to identify factors that influence west nile virus transmission lynn martin and his team started from the premise that stress hormones might represent a key link between individual-level of infection population-levels of parasite transmission and zoonotic disease risk they experimentally manipulated zebra finch taeniopygia guttata stress hormones by implanting corticosterone-filled silastic tubules and examined subsequent feeding preferences feeding success and productivity of mosquito vectors . despite performing more frequent

the avian influenza virus outbreak in 1997 highlighted the potential of the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus to cause severe disease in humans therefore effective vaccines against h5n1 viruses are needed to counter the potential threat of a global pandemic we have previously developed a fast-acting and efficacious vaccine against ebola virus ebov using the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv platform in this study we generated recombinant vsv-based h5n1 influenza virus vectors to demonstrate the feasibility of this platform for a fast-acting pan-h5 influenza virus vaccine we chose multiple approaches regarding antigen design and genome location to define a more optimized vaccine approach after the vsv-based h5n1 influenza virus constructs were recovered and characterized in vitro mice were vaccinated by a single dose or prime/boost regimen followed by challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous h5 clade 1 virus we found that a single dose of vsv vectors expressing full-length hemagglutinin hafl were sufficient to provide 100% protection the vaccine vectors were fast-acting as demonstrated by uniform protection when administered 3 days prior to lethal challenge moreover single vaccination induced cross-protective h5-specific antibodies and protected mice against lethal challenge with various h5 clade 2 viruses highlighting the potential of the vsv-based hafl as a pan-h5 influenza virus emergency vaccine npj vaccines 2020 54 https//doi
influenza is a perennial problem affecting millions of people annually with the everpresent threat of devastating pandemics active prophylaxis by vaccination against influenza virus is currently the main countermeasure supplemented with antivirals however disadvantages of this strategy include the impact of antigenic drift necessitating constant updating of vaccine strain composition and emerging antiviral drug resistance the development of other options for influenza prophylaxis particularly with broad acting agents able to provide protection in the period between the onset of a pandemic and the development of a strain specific vaccine is of great interest exploitation of broad-spectrum mediators could provide barricade protection in the early critical phase of influenza virus outbreaks passive immunity has the potential to provide immediate antiviral effects inhibiting virus replication reducing virus shedding and thereby protecting vulnerable populations in the event of an impending influenza pandemic here we review passive broad-spectrum influenza prophylaxis options with a focus on harnessing natural host defenses including interferons and antibodies
background campylobacter jejuni is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of many food-animals including sheep without causing visible clinical symptoms of disease however c jejuni has been implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide specifically in the usa the c jejuni sheep abortion sa clone has been increasingly associated with sheep abortion in vivo studies in sheep the natural host are needed to better characterize the virulence potential and pathogenesis of this clone results pregnant ewes intravenously iv or orally inoculated with ovine or bovine abortion-associated c jejuni sa clones exhibited partial or complete uterine prolapse with retained placenta and abortion or stillbirth whereas delivery of healthy lambs occurred in pregnant ewes inoculated with c jejuni 81-176 or in the uninfected group in sheep inoculated with the sa clone histopathological lesions including suppurative necrotizing placentitis and/or endometritis coincided with 1 increased apoptotic death of trophoblasts 2 increased expression of the host genes e g genes encoding interleukin il-6 and il-15 related to cellular necrosis and pro-inflammatory responses in uterus and 3 decreased expression of the genes encoding gata binding protein 6 chordin and insulin-like 3 insl3 that account for embryonic development in uterus immunohistochemistry revealed localization of bacterial antigens in trophoblasts lining the chorioallantoic membrane of ewes inoculated with the c jejuni sa clone conclusions the results showed that c jejuni sa clones are capable of causing abortion or stillbirth in experimentally infected sheep furthermore down-or up-regulation of specific genes in the uterus of infected pregnant ewes might implicate host genes in facilitating the disease progression since the c jejuni sa strains share genotypic similarities with clones that have been isolated from human clinical cases of gastroenteritis these strains might represent a potential public health risk
coronavirus disease 2019 threatens global public health and economy in order to develop safe and effective vaccines suitable animal models must be established here we report the rapid adaption of sars-cov-2 in balb/c mice based on which a convenient economical and effective animal model was developed specifically we found that mouse-adapted sars-cov-2 at passage 6 macsp6 efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type balb/c mice resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses the elevated infectivity of macsp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue n501y in the receptorbinding domain rbd using this novel animal model we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an rbd-based sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against sars-cov-2 macsp6 challenge this novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of sars-cov-2 vaccine this study describes a unique mouse model for sars-cov-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a sars-cov-2 rbd subunit vaccine
vaccines are considered one of the greatest advances in modern medicine the global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced and in some cases effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines however efforts to develop effective new vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza human immunodeficiency virus hiv dengue virus denv chikungunya virus chikv ebola virus and zika virus zikv have proven challenging zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in africa southeast asia and the pacific islands dating back over 50 years over this period zikv infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever arthralgia and rash in others concerns about zikv changed over the past two years however as outbreaks in brazil central american countries and caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to zikv infected mothers as well as an increased risk of guillain-barre syndrome in adults these findings prompted the world health organization to declare zikv a public health emergency in 2016 which resulted in expanded efforts to develop zikv vaccines and immunotherapeutics several zikv vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking zikv infection in animal models have since been developed with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-zikv monoclonal antibodies mabs that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of zikv infection in this review we summarize the current understanding of zikv biology and describe our efforts to rapidly develop a vaccine against zikv
12 the current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle this virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission 16 dynamics and with it the organ system involvement and other macroscopic dimensions of 17 the host environment this study examines the transmission ecology of the world main 18 livestock viruses 36 in total belonging to eleven different families and a mix of rna dna 19 and retroviruses viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion based on 20 the shifting organ system involvement and associated infection-shedding-transmission 21 dynamics as a next step this ranking is disentangled with the aim to contrast two main host 22 45 the virus two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge respectively for generalist type 46 outer-body and for specialist inner-body viruses
background/aim the role of humoral immunity in hepatitis c virus hcv infection is poorly understood nevertheless there is increasing interest in characterizing the neutralizing antibodies in the serum of hcv-infected patients focus reduction assays have been widely used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against a range of non-cytopathic viruses based on the recent development of a hcv cell culture system using the genotype 2 jfh-1-strain we developed a focus reduction assay for hcv-neutralizing antibodies the focus reduction assay was based on a standard microneutralization assay in which immunostained foci on tissue culture plates are counted the neutralizing anti-hcv antibodies titers of purified serum immunoglobulin samples from seventy-seven individuals were determined using a 50% focus reduction neutralization assay each titer was determined as the log value of the reciprocal antibody dilution that reduced the number of viral foci by 50%. igg antibodies were first purified from each serum in order to avoid the facilitating effect of hdl on hcv entry the assay's cut-off using an elisa and rna hcv-negative samples was found to be 1.25 log corresponding to a dilution of 118 the assay was compared with a commercial hcv elisa and exhibited specificity and sensitivity values of 100% and 96.5% respectively and good reproducibility with intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 6.7% and 12.6% respectively the assay did not show any cross-reactivity with anti-hiv anti-hbs or heterophile antibody-positive samples the neutralizing antibodies titers were 2.13 log 1134 for homologous samples from hcv genotype 2 infected patients harboring the same genotype as jfh-1 and 1.93 log 185 for heterologous samples from patients infected by genotypes other than type 2 these results confirm the presence of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies already reported using the hcv pseudoparticles system this study presents a simple specific and reproducible cell culture-based assay for determination of hcvneutralizing antibodies in human sera the assay should be an important tool for gauging the relationship between the neutralizing antibodies response and viral load kinetics in acutely or chronically infected patients and for investigating the possible eradication or prevention of hcv infection by neutralizing antibodies
we detected ferret coronaviruses in 44 55.7% of 79 pet ferrets tested in japan and classified the viruses into 2 genotypes on the basis of genotype-specific pcr our results show that 2 ferret coronaviruses that cause feline infectious peritonitis-like disease and epizootic catarrhal enteritis are enzootic among ferrets in japan
bats have been proposed as major reservoirs for diverse emerging infectious viral diseases with rabies being the best known in europe however studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce this study completes our active surveillance work on spanish bat colonies that began in 1992 herein we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies between 2001 and 2011 we collected and tested 2393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species the results for dead confirmed the presence of eblv-1 rna in six species analyzed for the first time in myotis capaccinii samples positive for european bat lyssavirus-1 eblv-1-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species seven of which were found for the first time even in myotis daubentonii a species to date always linked to eblv-2 eblv-1 seroprevalence 20.7% ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer july eblv-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies suggesting that intra-and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for eblv-1 transmission in bat colonies although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines eblv-1 variability we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in batspecies seroprevalence the results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding eblv-1-prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials
fecal microbiota transplantation fmt is the process by which fecal microbiota are donated from a healthy individual and subsequently transplanted into a diseased or young individual the mechanism by which fmt is effective is believed to be due to enhanced beneficial microbes increased microbiome diversity and restored normal flora beneficial gut microorganisms not only play a role in maintaining an intestinal barrier and metabolizing nutrients but importantly these microbes help regulate local and systemic immune function although fmt has been described for several centuries only recently has it been utilized as a mainstream therapy in humans and significantly considered for applications in other species in humans and animals gastrointestinal diseases are by far the most widely accepted fmt-treatable conditions however recent research has shown exceptional promise for fmt being used to treat or prevent other conditions including those outside of the gastrointestinal tract overall fmt is likely an underutilized widely-available and inexpensive tool for improving the health and response to disease in animals in this review the effects of fmt on veterinary diseases and potential applications for fmt in animals are discussed
an old world fruit bat pteropus giganteus held in captivity and suffering from necrosis of its wing digits failed to respond to antibiotic therapy and succumbed to the infection samples submitted to the national centre for foreign animal disease were tested for viral infection vero e6 cells exhibited minor but unique cytopathic effects on second blind passage and full cpe by passage four utilizing an unbiased random amplification technique from cell culture supernatant we identified a bacterium belonging to the bradyrhizobiaceae purification of cell culture supernatant on ty media revealed a slow growing bacterial isolate in this study using electron microscopy 16s rrna gene analysis and whole genome sequencing we identify a novel bacterial species associated with the site of infection belonging to the genus afipia this genus of bacteria is very diverse with only a limited number of species characterized afipia felis previously described as the etiological agent to cause cat scratch disease and afipia septicemium most recently shown to cause disease in humans highlight the potential for members of this genus to form a branch of opportunistic pathogens within the bradyrhizobiaceae increased utilization of next generation sequencing and genomics will aid in classifying additional members of this intriguing bacterial genera
background glaesserella parasuis the causative agent of glӓsser's disease is widespread in swine globally resulting in significant economic losses to the swine industry prevention of glӓsser's disease in pigs has been plagued with an inability to design broadly protective vaccines as many bacterin based platforms generate serovar or strain specific immunity subunit vaccines are of interest to provide protective immunity to multiple strains of g parasuis selected proteins for subunit vaccination should be widespread highly conserved and surface exposed results two candidate proteins for subunit vaccination rlpb and vacj against g parasuis were identified using random mutagenesis and an in vitro organ culture system pigs were vaccinated with recombinant rlpb and vacj outer membrane proteins with important contributions to cellular function and viability though high antibody titers to the recombinant proteins and increased interferon-γ producing cells were found in subunit vaccinated animals the pigs were not protected from developing systemic disease conclusions it appears there may be insufficient rlpb and vacj exposed on the bacterial surface for antibody to bind preventing high rlpb and vacj specific antibody titers from protecting animals from g parasuis additionally this work confirms the importance of utilizing the natural host species when assessing the efficacy of vaccine candidates
a single intracerebroventricular injection of 100 ng of fl-endorphin altered the course of the central nervous system cns infection of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv tsg31-ks5 when mice were administered fl-endorphin and then 24 h later infected intracerebrally with tsg31-ks5 vsv 70% of the animals died within 8 days of infection in comparison less than 10% of the animals had died after 21 days when infected with tsg31-ks5 vsv alone when mice were injected with fl-endorphin and tsg31-ks5 vsv simultaneously or with fl-endorphin 21 days after infection the more aggressive clinical disease was not observed superficially the more lethal disease induced by fl-endorphin appeared to be a result of a mild hypothermia caused by the neuropeptide fl-endorphin however did not influence the disease in nude nu/nu mice even though their core temperatures were reduced to an extent similar to that of balb/c + / + mice implicating the involvement of t lymphocytes in the alteration of the course of infection in normal mice
bats and dogs are the main reservoirs of rabies virus rabv in latin america and are responsible for the maintenance of different cycles of infection in the two neighbour and most southern brazilian states of rio grande do sul rs and santa catarina sc rabies in dogs has been successfully controlled for more than 30 years however rabies associated to the rural cycle remains endemic with a significant though oscillating-annual incidence of rabies in cattle despite the plethora of studies on genetic analyses of brazilian rabv isolates from southern brazil have only scarcely been investigated this work was performed to identify the genetic lineages of rabvs circulating in states of rs and sc fifty-nine rabv cattle isolates from rs and sc were selected and submitted to reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr followed by sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene in rs the circulation of two sublineages 1a and 1b of rabv was detected both with characteristics of lineages usually detected in vampire bats desmodus rotundus in sc only one sublineage of rabv 1b was detected nevertheless the findings reported here are expected to contribute to the understanding of the biology of the virus in the region and its interactions with the natural host d rotundus
diarrhoea among growing pigs 8-13 weeks old is a significant problem in many herds nine herds with poor performance and diarrhoea among growing pigs were selected on the basis of their piglet mean age at a body weight of 25 kg compared to the overall mean age in swedish herds in addition four herds with good average performance and no problems with diarrhoea were selected pigs were necropsied and samples for histology and microbiology were collected based on the necropsy findings the pigs from the good performing herds were all judged to be healthy the presence of brachyspira pilosicoli and lawsonia intracellularis was significantly correlated to poor performing herds and the results indicate that these microbes are main pathogens involved in enteric diseases among swedish grower pigs in addition concomitant infections with other presumptive pathogens were commonly found
both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza are acute highly contagious swine diseases these diseases pose severe threats for the swine industry and cause heavy economic losses worldwide in this study we have developed a chimeric viruslike particle vlp vaccine candidate for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and h3n2 influenza virus and investigated its immunogenicity in mice the ha and m1 proteins from the h3n2 influenza virus and the prrsv gp5 protein fused to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the na protein were both incorporated into the chimeric vlps analysis of the immune responses showed that the chimeric vlps elicited serum antibodies specific for both prrsv gp5 and the h3n2 ha protein and they stimulated cellular immune responses compared to the responses to equivalent amounts of inactivated viruses taken together the results suggested that the chimeric vlp vaccine represents a potential strategy for the development of a safe and effective vaccine to control prrsv and h3n2 influenza virus c xue and w wang contributed equally to this work
emerging porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses pedvs have caused large economic losses since 2010 and g2b is the prevalent globally epidemic genotype given the fastidious isolation of emerging pedv in cell culture and difficulties in retaining the isolate infectivity upon further in vitro passage highly attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus rvsv mt was used as a vector to express the pedv spike s protein aiming to develop a subunit vaccine against g2b viruses an s protein with 19 of its cytoplasmic domain amino acids deleted could be incorporated into vsv particles generating rvsv mt vsv mt -s δ19 with high efficiency our results suggest that vsv mt -s δ19 could effectively induce pedv-specific immunity in pigs via intramuscular but not intranasal immunization notably immunizations of sows with vsv mt -s δ19 provided protective lactogenic immunity against a virulent g2b pedv challenge in piglets consequently recombinant vsv mt may be a promising platform for preparing a subunit vaccine against pedv
recombinant fragments of s proteins from the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sara-cov were generated and used in a western blot wb assay that was compared to a commercial sars elisa method in 85% of confirmed sars cases n = 20 the s2 recombinant fragment based wb was positive and this was comparable to the commercial elisa using heat killed sars-cov wb using the other four recombinant fragments in confirmed sars cases generated lower rates of detection s1-75% s1-n-25% s1-c-55%. evaluation of sera from healthy controls n = 60 resulted in two weakly positive elisa results with the remainder being negative while the s2 protein wb demonstrated three positive results from the 20 controls with a history of sars contact and no positive results in 40 noncontact controls a discrepancy between the elisa and s2 wb arose when evaluating per-2003 sera from individuals n = 10 with sars-like symptoms elisa-100% positive s2 wb-30% positive these data suggest that the s2 wb assay may be particularly useful in elisa-negative sars cases and in some elisa-positive non-sars cases d
neonatal calf diarrhea was once believed to be of solely bacterial viz e coli etiology however in 1969 a reovirus-like agent 1 2 and in 1972 a coronavirus 3 4 were isolated from diarrheic calves these viruses in gnotobiotic calves caused diarrhea typical of that seen in field cases the recent association of a reovirus-like agent with acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis of infants and young children in many parts of the world 5-23 has stimulated interest in viral enteritis and in particular diarrhea caused by reovirus-like agents in this paper calf diarrhea caused by a reovirus-like agent will be reviewed
reports one of several issues raised for future study was the potential for recombination of virusvectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains this paper presents an assessment of this issue formulated by the brighton collaboration to provide an appropriate context for understanding the potential for recombination of virusvectored vaccines we review briefly the current status of virus vectored vaccines mechanisms of recombination between viruses experience with recombination involving live attenuated vaccines in the field and concerns raised previously in the literature regarding recombination of virusvectored vaccines with wild type virus strains we then present a discussion of the major variables that could influence recombination between a virus-vectored vaccine and circulating wild type virus and the consequences of such recombination including intrinsic recombination properties of the parent virus used as a vector sequence relatedness of vector and wild virus virus host range pathogenesis and transmission replication competency of vector in target host mechanism of vector attenuation additional factors potentially affecting virulence and circulation of multiple recombinant vectors in the same target population finally we present some guiding principles for vector design and testing intended to anticipate and mitigate the potential for and consequences of recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains
an experimental model using 3-day-old snatch-farrowed colostrum-deprived piglets co-infected with porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 and porcine parvovirus ppv is at present one of the best methods to study factors affecting development of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws a swedish isolate of pcv2 s-pcv2 retrieved in 1993 from a healthy pig has been used in this model to reproduce pmws in pigs from northern ireland this virus has been present in the swedish pig population for at least a decade without causing any known pmws disease problems despite its potential pathogenicity the reasons for this are unknown but could be related to genetics absence of triggers for pcv2 upregulation infectious agent and/or management forms within swedish pig husbandry in order to confirm the pathogenicity of s-pcv2 swedish and danish pigs were experimentally infected with this isolate according to the established model swedish pigs were also infected with a reference isolate of pcv2 pcv2-1010 to compare the severity of disease caused by the two isolates in swedish pigs both danish and swedish pigs developed pmws after the experimental infection with s-pcv2 antibodies to pcv2 developed later and reached lower levels in serum from pigs infected with s-pcv2 than in pigs inoculated with pcv2-1010 in general pigs infected with s-pcv2 showed more severe clinical signs of disease than pigs infected with pcv2-1010 but pigs from all pcv2inoculated groups displayed gross and histological lesions consistent with pmws all pigs inoculated with ppv alone or in combination with pcv2 displayed interleukin-10 responses in serum while only pigs infected with ppv in combination with www elsevier com/locate/vetmic veterinary microbiology 106 2005 49-60 pcv2 showed interferon-a in serum on repeated occasions thus the pathogenicity of s-pcv2 was confirmed and a role for cytokines in the etiology of pmws was indicated #
miller virulent strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev were generated and characterized in a cell culture immunofluorescence ccif assay three mabs directed against peplomer protein e 2 had perinuclear fluorescence and four unclassified mabs showed cell membrane fluorescence six of these seven mabs neutralized both attenuated and virulent tgev and the seventh an unclassified mab neutralized only the latter virus two mabs able to bind the cell membrane of infected cells had low neutralizing antibody titers 8 to 72 but were able to distinguish between virulent and attenuated tgev 9-to 72-fold differences in neutralizing titers two e 2-specific mabs had higher neutralizing antibody titers 782 to 34117 and showed 4-to 13-fold differences in titers against the attenuated and virulent tgev strains five mabs which were specific for nucleocapsid n protein had cytoplasmic particulate fluorescence in ccif and did not neutralize tgev comparison of ccif antibody titers of mabs to the virulent and attenuated strains of tgev indicated that differences existed in titers of most e 2 and all n-specific mabs with titers consistently higher against virulent tgev homologous strain hyperimmune antisera prepared in gnotobiotic pigs against the attenuated virulent and a recent isolate oftgev immunoprecipitated the 3 major structural proteins of both the attenuated and virulent tgev strains relative mot wt differences in the e 1 and e 2 proteins between the two virus strains were revealed using either the hyperimmune pig sera or mabs in addition to the 48 k n protein a 44 k protein was coimmunoprecipitated by the hyperimmune sera and mabs but mainly from lysates of attenuated tgev
the effects of route of administration on systemic and gut mucosal immune responses induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection in suckling pigs were investigated twenty-four conventional 5-dayold suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally intranasally i n intramuscularly i m with pedv or dmem mock pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load blood samples were collected at 7 14 21 days post infection dpi and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production t cell and natural killer nk cell frequencies nk cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels oral inoculation led to higher levels of pedv-specific iga antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific igg antibodies in serum pedv-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower nk cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi the orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher cd3+cd8+ t cell frequencies as compared to i n or i m inoculated pigs at 14 dpi while there was no significant difference among orally i n or i m inoculated pigs and control pigs in cd3+cd4+ t cell frequencies in peripheral blood pedv-infected and control pigs had low but detectable nk cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi however nk cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not serum il-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined serum il-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower in conclusion oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses
rotavirus detection by direct electron microscopy was compared with direct and indirect immune electron microscopy techniques the latter two approaches permitted the enumeration of 25 and 103 times more rotaviruses respectively than direct electron microscopy also 70% and 90% of the virus particles were aggregated by direct and indirect immune electron microscopy techniques respectively thus facilitating their detection
background feline leukaemia virus felv and feline immunodeficiency virus fiv are major causes of morbidity and mortality in domestic and wild felids despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets information about felv and fiv in malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners a cross-sectional study was carried out from january 2010 to december 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with felv and fiv among domestic cats in peninsular malaysia plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of felv p27 antigen and fiv antibodies using an immunochromatographic kit additionally data on cat demographics and health were collected using a structured questionnaire and were evaluated as potential risk factors for felv or fiv status results of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study 12.2% 45/368 95% ci = 8.88 -15.58 were positive for felv p27 antigen 31.3% 115/368 95% ci = 26.51 -35.99 were seropositive to fiv antibodies and 4.3% 16/368 95% ci = 2.27 -6.43 had evidence of both viruses factors found to significantly increase the risk for felv seropositivity include sex age behaviour sickness and living in a multi-cat household seropositive response to fiv was significantly associated with sex neuter status age behaviour and health status the present study indicates that felv and fiv are common among domestic cats in peninsular malaysia and that factors related to cat demographics and health such as age sex behaviour health status and type of household are important predictors for seropositive status to felv or fiv in peninsular malaysia high prevalence of felv or fiv observed in our study is of concern in view of the immunosuppressive potentials of the two pathogens specific measures for control and prevention such as screening and routine vaccination are needed to ensure that felv and fiv are controlled in the cat population of peninsular malaysia
in conjunction with an increasing public awareness of infectious diseases the textile industry and scientists are developing hygienic fabrics by the addition of various antimicrobial and antiviral compounds in the current study sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan are applied to cotton fabrics in order to gain antimicrobial and antiviral properties for the first time the antimicrobial activity of textiles treated with 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate 0.03 % triclosan and 7 % glucapon has been investigated against a broad range of microorganisms including bacteria yeast and fungi moreover modified cotton fabrics were tested against adenovirus type 5 and poliovirus type 1 according to the test results the modified textile goods attained very good antimicrobial and antiviral properties thus the results of the present study clearly suggest that sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan solution-treated textiles can be considered in the development of antimicrobial and antiviral textile finishes
background recent advances in xenotransplantation have produced organs from pigs that are well tolerated in primate models because of genetic changes engineered to delete major antigens from donor animals to ensure the safety of human transplant recipients it will be essential to understand both the spectrum of infectious agents in donor pigs and their potential to be transmitted to immunocompromised transplant recipients equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients herein we report the development of a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host the reproducibility sensitivity and specificity of each assay were evaluated and were found to exhibit analytic sensitivity that was similar to that of quantitative assays used to perform viral load testing of human viruses in clinical laboratories results this analytical approach was used to detect nucleic acids of infectious agents present in specimens from 9 sows and 22 piglets derived by caesarean section the most commonly detected targets in adult animals were mycoplasma species and two distinct herpesviruses porcine lymphotrophic herpesvirus 2 and 3 a total of 14 piglets were derived from three sows infected with either or both herpesviruses yet none tested positive for the viruses indicating that vertical transmission of these viruses is inefficient the data presented demonstrate that procedures in place are highly sensitive and can specifically detect nucleic acids from target organisms in the panel thus ensuring the safety of organs for transplantation as well as the monitoring of patients potentially receiving them coronaviruses herpesviruses infectious disease panel virus safety of xenotransplantation
• for a comprehensive analysis of cov diversity we sampled 41 species of neotropical bats cov sequences were detected in bats belonging to frugivorous artibeus jamaicensis carollia perspicillata and carollia castanea and nectivorous glossophaga soricina species glossophaga soricina cov clustered in a different subgroup apart from cov sequences found in the same bat species.• the non-clustering of these newly described bat cov sequences near sequences from known pathogenic human covs and the low prevalence found suggests that the risk of spillover of known human pathogenic covs carried by bats is low.• the finding of diverse cov sequences in one specific bat species emphasizes that the whole diversity of cov is still unknown and that surveillance should be continued
serum neutralizing antibody titers are indicative of protective immunity against coxsackievirus a16 cv-a16 and enterovirus 71 ev71 the two main etiological agents of hand foot and mouth disease hfmd and provide the basis for evaluating vaccine efficacy the current cv-a16 neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effects requires manual microscopic examination which is time-consuming and labor-intensive in this study a high-throughput neutralization assay was developed by employing cv-a16 pseudoviruses expressing luciferase for detecting infectivity in rhabdomyosarcoma rd cells and measuring serum viral neutralizing antibodies without the need to use infectious cv-a16 strains the neutralizing antibody titer against cv-a16 could be determined within 15 h by measuring luciferase signals by this assay the pseudovirus cv-a16 neutralization assay pcna was validated by comparison with a conventional cv-a16 neutralization assay ccna in testing 174 human serum samples collected from children age <5 years the neutralizing antibody titers determined by these two assays were well correlated r 2 = 0.7689 these results suggest that the pcna can serve as a rapid and objective procedure for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies against cv-a16
iga responses using bacillus anthracis edema toxin edtx as an adjuvant we previously showed that innate responses triggered after sublingual immunization could limit generation of iga responses we tested whether co-administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor nei could rescue the ability of edtx to induce broad antibody responses including mucosal iga nei supplementation of sublingual vaccines containing edtx promoted antigen-specific serum iga responses but also enhanced serum igg1 and igg2b responses this enhancing effect of nei did not extend to all antibody isotypes and igg sublclasses since nei reduced serum ige responses and did not affect igg2a/c and igg3 responses nei supplementation also promoted anti-bacillus anthracis protective antigen pa neutralizing antibodies and enhanced high affinity igg1 and iga antibodies in addition to serum iga nei supplementation stimulated antigen-specific mucosal iga responses in the gi tract and enhanced antigen-specific igg responses in vaginal washes analysis of cd4 + t helper cell responses revealed that co-administration of nei broadened the profile of cytokine responses by stimulating th1 th2 th17 and tfh cytokines we also noted that nei had a higher stimulatory effect on il-5 il-10 il-17 responses published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/
the inflexibility of existing serological techniques for detection of rabies in surveillance constrains the benefit to be gained from many current control strategies we analysed 304 serum samples from tanzanian dogs for the detection of rabies antibodies in a pseudotype assay using lentiviral vectors bearing the cvs-11 envelope glycoprotein compared with the widely used gold standard fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation assay a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 94.4% with a strong correlation of antibody titres r = 0.915 were observed with the pseudotype assay to increase the assay's surveillance specificity in africa we incorporated the envelope glycoprotein of local viruses lagos bat virus duvenhage virus or mokola virus and also cloned the lacz gene to provide a reporter element neutralisation assays using pseudotypes bearing these glycoproteins reveal that they provide a greater sensitivity compared to similar live virus assays and will therefore allow a more accurate determination of the distribution of these highly pathogenic infections and the threat they pose to human health importantly the cvs-11 pseudotypes were highly stable during freeze-thaw cycles and storage at room temperature these results suggest the proposed pseudotype assay is a suitable option for undertaking lyssavirus serosurveillance in areas most affected by these infections
the conditions of a rapid indirect-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for infectious bronchitis virus ibv antibodies have been established optimal sensitivity was obtained using 10 ~g/ml protein concentration of the mass 41 strain purified from infected allantoic fluid specificity was demonstrated with newcastle disease virus ndv antigen-antibody system negligible crossreactions were observed after bromelain or lipase treatment ibv had an elisa reactivity similar to untreated particles suggesting that peripheral constituents of ibv play a minor role when whole virus is adsorbed on solid phase the method offers a simple and specific antibody assay which could be used for the laboratory diagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis
recombinant adeno-associated viral raav vectors promote long-term gene transfer in many animal species significant effort has focused on the evaluation of raav delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease however canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus cpv raav and cpv possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses thus any immune response generated to cpv vaccination has the potential to cross-react with raav vectors in this study we investigated the immune response to raav6 delivery in a cohort of cpv-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of cpv-vaccination we show that cpv-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to raav6 in addition no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the raav6-directed immune response between cpv-vaccinated animals and controls moreover cpv-vaccination did not inhibit raav6-mediated transduction we also evaluated the immune response to early raav6vaccination in neonatal mice the influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate we hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to raav6 when delivered during the neonatal period mice were vaccinated with raav6 at 1 or 5 days of age and subsequently challenged with raav6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential im injections 1 month apart all vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to raav6vaccination that was enhanced following im injection in adulthood taken together these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against raav6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice
metagenomics is helping to expand the known diversity of viruses especially of those with poorly studied hosts in remote areas the neotropical region harbors a considerable diversity of avian species that may play a role as both host and short-distance vectors of unknown viruses viral metagenomics of cloacal swabs from 50 neotropical birds collected in french guiana revealed the presence of four complete astrovirus genomes they constitute an early diverging novel monophyletic clade within the avastrovirus phylogeny representing a putative new astrovirus species provisionally designated as avastrovirus 5 according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv classification criteria their genomic organization shares some characteristics with avastrovirus but also with mamastrovirus the pan-astrovirus rt-pcr analysis of the cloacal samples of 406 wild neotropical birds showed a community-level prevalence of 4.9% 5.1% in passerines the highest described so far in this order of birds by screening birds of a remote region we expanded the known host range of astroviruses to the avian families cardinalidae conopophagidae furnariidae thamnophilidae turdidae and tyrannidae our results provide important first insights into the unexplored viral communities the ecology epidemiology and features of host-pathogen interactions that shape the evolution of avastroviruses in a remote neotropical rainforest the last decades have witnessed a broadening of the global diversity of viruses thanks to rapidly evolving random amplification sequencing technology next generation sequencing ngs has revolutionized our knowledge by not only uncovering the diversity of viruses at an unprecedented rate but also by allowing to gain insight into their ecology and distribution helping to disentangle the network that connects viruses with their hosts and the geographical scenario in which such interactions take place 1 . however deciphering the global virome and its structure becomes challenging not just because of the technical difficulties associated with the screening of diverse viruses but because their many hosts are often understudied particularly those from remote areas the neotropical region is one such example being among the most biodiverse realms on earth neotropical rainforests are candidates to host and conserve relevant parts of the virosphere diversity 2 . however the knowledge of neotropical viral diversity and their hosts is in its infancy given that zoonotic viruses are considered the most probable causative agents of emerging diseases 3 and that mammal and avian species are their main hosts 45 the study of the wildlife viral diversity and their ecological context in these remote areas will provide important information for public and animal health to prevent potential new emerging viral epidemics 26 . for example the great diversity of the neotropical fauna harbors the risk of emergence of new infections in domestic animals and
canine parvovirus cpv-2 remains an important cause of devastating enteritis in young dogs it can be successfully prevented with live attenuated cpv-2 vaccines when given at the appropriate age and in the absence of maternal antibody interference rapid diagnosis of parvoviral enteritis in young dogs is essential to ensuring suitable barrier nursing protocols within veterinary hospitals the current diagnostic trend is to use multiplexed pcr panels to detect an array of pathogens commonly responsible for diarrhea in dogs the multiplexed pcr assays do not distinguish wild from vaccine cpv-2 they are highly sensitive and detect even a low level of virus shedding such as those caused by the cpv-2 vaccine the aim of this study was to identify the cpv-2 subtypes detected in diagnostic specimens and rule out occult shedding of cpv-2 vaccine strains for a total of 21 samples that tested positive for cpv-2 in a small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic multiplexed tandem pcr mt-pcr panel during 2014e2016 we partially characterized the vp2 gene of cpv-2 vaccine cpv-2 strain wild type cpv-2a subtypes and vaccine-like cpv-2b subtypes were detected high copy number was indicative of wild-type cpv-2a presence but presence of vaccine-like cpv-2b had a variable copy number in fecal samples a yardstick approach to a copy number or c t -value to discriminate vaccine strain from a wild type virus of cpv-2 can be in some cases potentially misleading therefore discriminating vaccine strain from a wild type subtype of cpv-2 remains ambitious
the jamaican fruit bat artibeus jamaicensis is one of the most common bats in the tropical americas it is thought to be a potential reservoir host of tacaribe virus an arenavirus closely related to the south american hemorrhagic fever viruses we performed transcriptome sequencing and annotation from lung kidney and spleen tissues using 454 and illumina platforms to develop this species as an animal model more than 100000 contigs were assembled with 25000 genes that were functionally annotated of the remaining unannotated contigs 80% were found within bat genomes or transcriptomes annotated genes are involved in a broad range of activities ranging from cellular metabolism to genome regulation through ncrnas reciprocal blast best hits yielded 8785 sequences that are orthologous to mouse rat cattle horse and human species tree analysis of sequences from 2378 loci was used to achieve 95% bootstrap support for the placement of bat as sister to the clade containing horse dog and cattle through substitution rate estimation between bat and human 32 genes were identified with evidence for positive selection we also identified 466 immune-related genes which may be useful for studying tacaribe virus infection of this species the jamaican fruit bat transcriptome dataset is a resource that should provide additional candidate markers for studying bat evolution and ecology and tools for analysis of the host response and pathology of disease
there is a global need to elucidate protective antigens expressed by the sars-coronavirus sars-cov monoclonal antibody reagents that recognise specific antigens on sars-cov are needed urgently in this report the development and immunochemical characterisation of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies mabs against the sars-cov is presented based upon their specificity binding requirements and biological activity initial screening by elisa using highly purified virus as the coating antigen resulted in the selection of 103 mabs to the sars virus subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen igg mabs a single mab f26g15 is specific for the nucleoprotein as seen in western immunoblot while five other mabs react with the spike protein two of these spike-specific mabs demonstrate the ability to neutralise sars-cov in vitro while another four western immunoblot-negative mabs also neutralise the virus the utility of these mabs for diagnostic development is demonstrated antibody from convalescent sars patients but not normal human serum is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mabs to whole sars-cov these studies highlight the importance of using standardised assays and reagents these mabs will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests studies of sars-cov pathogenesis and vaccine development
in order to assess the immunotherapeutic potential on canine visceral leishmaniasis of the leishmune ® vaccine formulated with an increased adjuvant concentration 1 mg of saponin rather than 0.5 mg 24 mongrel dogs were infected with leishmania l chagasi the enriched-leishmune ® vaccine was injected on month 6 7 and 8 after infection when animals were seropositive and symptomatic the control group were injected with a saline solution leishmune ® -treated dogs showed significantly higher levels of anti-fml igg antibodies anova p < 0.0001 a higher and stable igg2 and a decreasing igg1 response pointing to a th1 t cell mediated response the vaccine had the following effects it led to more positive delayed type hypersensitivity reactions against leishmania lysate in vaccinated dogs 75% than in controls 50% to a decreased average of cd4+ leishmania-specific lymphocytes in saline controls 32.13% that fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the vaccinees 41.62% ci95% 43.93-49.80 and an increased average of the clinical scores from the saline controls 17.83 that falls outside the 95% confidence interval for the leishmune ® immunotherapy-treated dogs 15.75 all dogs that received the vaccine were clustered and showed lower clinical scores and normal cd4+ counts whereas 42% of the untreated dogs showed very diminished cd4+ and higher clinical score the increase in clinical signs of the saline treated group was correlated with an increase in anti-fml antibodies p < 0.0001 the parasitological evidence p = 0.038 and a decrease in leishmania-specific cd4+ lymphocyte proportions p = 0.035 these results confirm the immunotherapeutic potential of the enriched-leishmune ® vaccine the vaccine reduced the clinical symptoms and evidence of parasite modulating the outcome of the infection and the dog's potential infectiosity to phlebotomines the enriched-leishmune ® vaccine was subjected to a safety analysis and found to be well tolerated and safe
bird to human transmission of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus hpaiv poses a significant risk of triggering a flu pandemic in the human population therefore vaccination of susceptible poultry during an hpaiv outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions to this end suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge the aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants two adjuvants namely bacterium-like particles blp and advax were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that blp and advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up blp and advax/blp adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the nonadjuvanted formulation remarkably all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the advax group overall our results indicate that passive inhalation is feasible effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens if it can be adapted to field settings

background human metapneumovirus hmpv a recently identified virus causes acute respiratory tract infections artis in infants and children however studies on the seroepidemeology of hmpv are very limited in china to assess the seroprevalence of hmpv infection in china we tested a total of 1156 serum specimens for the presence of anti-hmpv igg antibody in children and adults free of acute respiratory illness in beijing china by using hmpv nucleocapsid n protein as an antigen as a control we used the human serum antibody against the n protein of human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv the most important viral agent responsible for aris in children results the seropositive rate for hmpv increased steadily with age from 67% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20 however the rate dropped slightly between 6 mo and 1 yr of age the seropositive rate for hrsv also increased steadily with age from 71% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20 in children aged six months to six years the seropositive rates for the anti-hrsv igg antibody were significantly higher than those for hmpv additionally igg antibody titers to hmpv and hrsv were significantly higher in adults than in young children consistent with the seropositive rates the geometric mean titer of anti-hmpv igg antibody was lower than that of anti-hrsv igg antibody in children aged six months to six years our results indicate that similar to hrsv exposure to hmpv is ubiquitous in the beijing population however the seroprevalence of anti-hmpv igg antibody is lower than that of hrsv in children between six months and six years old which suggests a different number of repeat infections or a different response to infections
the frequency of group a bovine rotavirus gpa brv in calves from 1998 to 2002 was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique in 2177 faecal samples of which 1898 samples were diarrhoeic and 279 were of normal consistency control group that were collected from asymptomatic calves for comparative purposes the animals were from beef and dairy cattle herds n = 321 from 158 counties in seven states paraná são paulo minas gerais mato grosso do sul mato grosso goiás and rondônia and four brazilian geographical regions south south-east centre-west and north gpa brv was detected in 19.4% 369/1898 p = 0.0001 of the samples collected in calves with diarrhoea and in only 2.2% 6/279 p = 0.0001 of the faeces with normal consistency the proportion of positive samples collected from beef and dairy cattle herds was 22.8% 205/899 p = 0.0001 and 16.4% 169/999 p = 0.0005 respectively in relation to age a higher prevalence of infections was found in calves up to 30 days old where 33.0% 189/573 p = 0.0001 and 20.2% 138/683 p = 0.0001 of the diarrhoeic faecal samples from beef and dairy cattle herds respectively were positive for gpa brv these results show the pos-
the serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides neomycin kanamycin and streptomycin were determined after intravenous iv and intramuscular im administration these values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean f sd peak serum concentration of 23.2 f 10.2 pg/ml present at 30 mins and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 f 0.8 pg/ml from the pharmacological analysis of concentration-time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the i m injection site with an absorption half-time of 0.16 f 0.05 and was well absorbed systemic availability was 73.7 f 26.9 per cent a peak tissue level which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug at 8 h the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time based on the mic values of the majority of isolates of corynebacterium equi and only a few isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae escherichia coli salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus equi one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 pg neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage 10 mg/ kg to be therapeutically effective
inovirus-associated vectors iavs are engineered non-lytic filamentous bacteriophages that are assembled primarily from thousands of copies of the major coat protein gp8 and just five copies of each of the four minor coat proteins gp3 gp6 gp7 and gp9 inovirus display studies have shown that the architecture of inoviruses makes all coat proteins of the inoviral particle accessible to the outside this particular feature of iavs allows foreign antigenic peptides to be displayed on the outer surface of the virion fused to its coat proteins and for more than two decades has been exploited in many applications including antibody or peptide display libraries drug design and vaccine development against infectious and non-infectious diseases as vaccine carriers iavs have been shown to elicit both a cellular and humoral response against various pathogens through the display of antibody epitopes on their coat proteins despite their high immunogenicity the goal of developing an effective vaccine against hiv-1 has not yet materialized one possible limitation of previous efforts was the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies which exhibited autoreactivity properties in the past five years however new more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that do not exhibit autoreactivity properties have been isolated from hiv-1 infected individuals suggesting that vaccination strategies aimed at producing such broadly neutralizing antibodies may confer protection against infection the utilization of these new broadly neutralizing antibodies in combination with the architectural traits of iavs have driven the current developments in the design of an inovirus-based vaccineviruses 2014 6 5048 against hiv-1 this article reviews the applications of iavs in vaccine development with particular emphasis on the design of inoviral-based vaccines against hiv-1
we collected a total of 1867 animal samples cave-dwelling bats rodents non-human primates and other wild animals we explored the diversity of covs and determined the factors driving the infection of covs in wild animals based on a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction only bats belonging to the hipposideros gigas 4/156 hipposideros cf ruber 13/262 and miniopterus inflatus 1/249 species were found infected with covs we identified alphacoronaviruses in h gigas and h open scientific reports | 2020 107314 | https//doi org/10.1038/s41598-020-64159-1www nature com/scientificreports www nature com/scientificreports/ play an important role in the chain of transmission and the emergence of these viruses in humans namely palm civets 5 and wild rodents in which infections by an alphacoronavirus and a betacoronavirus have been recently identified 16 .gabon a country located in central africa displays a large diversity of wildlife species aside from bats in which covs have been detected in the cave-dwelling species hipposideros cf ruber 17 to our knowledge there is no information on the carriage of other mammalian species covs are prone to host switching 18 and could be a current and future threat to public health the aim of this study was to explore the genetic diversity and the ecology of covs circulating among several wild mammals in gabon in order to determine the potential reservoir species of these viruses and the risk for zoonotic emergence and identify the factors driving covs infection in bats
the past few months have yielded disconcerting news about viruses carried in mammalian reservoirs what is the relevance of virus discoveries mushrooming in the literature will bats yield the next pandemic virus animal ecologists and virologists need to join forces
we investigated the ability of monoclonal b cells to restore primary and secondary t-cell dependent antibody responses in adoptive immune-deficient hosts priming induced b cell activation and expansion aid expression antibody production and the generation of igm + iggand igm -igg + antigen-experienced b-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division upon secondary transfer and recall the igm -igg + cells responded by the production of antigen-specific igg while the igm + memory cells secreted mainly igm and little igg but generated new b cells expressing germinal center markers the recall responses were more efficient if the antigenic boost was delayed suggesting that a period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond overall these findings indicate that reconstitution of a functional and complete memory pool requires transfer of all different antigen-experienced b cell subsets we also found that the size of the memory b cell pool did not rely on the number of the responding naïve b cells suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for naïve and memory b cells by reconstituting a stable memory b cell pool in immune-deficient hosts using a monoclonal high-affinity b cell population we demonstrate the potential value of b cell adoptive immunotherapy
background to increase understanding of human bacterial and parasitic pathogens in bats we investigated the prevalence of babesia spp rickettsia spp anaplasma spp and coxiella burnetii in bats from china methods bats were captured from mengyin county shandong province of china using nets dna was extracted from the blood and spleen of bats for molecular detection of babesia spp rickettsia spp anaplasma spp and coxiella burnetii with specific primers for each species results a total of 146 spleen samples and 107 blood samples of insectivorous bats which belonged to 6 species within two families were collected from mengyin county shandong province of china we found that two eptesicus serotinus 2/15 13.3% were positive for babesia vesperuginis we were unable to detect genomic sequences for rickettsia spp anaplasma spp and coxiella burnetii conclusions to our knowledge our study showed for the first time the presence of babesia vesperuginis in eptesicus serotinus collected from china suggesting that babesia vesperuginis has a broad host species and geographical distribution
with rabbit patients as in other species analyzing blood and urine samples can be useful and informative although interpretation of the results is sometimes challenging this article summarizes the interpretation of laboratory results from rabbits hematological parameters can yield information about the red blood cell population and leukocyte response to stress and pathogens biochemistry evaluation can be used to investigate liver kidney and other organ function and urinalysis results may yield additional information about kidney function and electrolyte imbalances serological tests are available for several pathogens of rabbits including encephalitozoon cuniculi although the significance of positive results and antibody titers is not clear serum protein electrophoresis aids the understanding of protein disorders and the immune response to acute and chronic inflammation
background prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand foot and mouth disease hfmd primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 ev71 infection children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to ev71 infections in addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus those containing virus-like particles vlps with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for ev71 infections with safety and productivity advantages we previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the ev71 capsid protein which assembled into spherical particles this study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of ev71 infection methods to evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate neonatal mice born by immunized female mice as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with ev71 virus whereafter the survival rates clinical scores and viral loads were measured results the high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers which were transferred to neonatal mice thereby facilitating effective resistance towards ev71 infection an active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization conclusions the present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating ev71 infections
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by a coronavirus sars-cov and has the potential to threaten global public health and socioeconomic stability evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement ade of sars-cov infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine using antibodies from sars patients we identified and characterized sars-cov b-cell peptide epitopes with disparate functions in rhesus macaques the spike glycoprotein peptides s 471−503 s 604−625 and s 1164−1191 elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates in contrast peptide s 597−603 induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates by using an epitope sequence-dependent esd mechanism this peptide exhibited a high level of serological reactivity 64% which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem epitopes s 597−603 and s 604−625 and a long-term human b-cell memory response with antisera from convalescent sars patients thus peptide-based vaccines against sars-cov could be engineered to avoid ade via elimination of the s 597−603 epitope we provide herein an alternative strategy to prepare a safe and effective vaccine for ade of viral infection by identifying and eliminating epitope sequence-dependent enhancement of viral infection
in order to determine highly immunogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov epitope peptides capable of inducing long-lasting immunity we first screened immunoglobulin-g igg antibodies reactive to 197 different overlapping 15-mers from the sars-cov proteins in the sera of three infected patients forty-two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients consequently we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera n ¼ 45 at 6-month post-infection the significantly higher levels of igg antibodies specific to three s791 m207 and n161 of 42 peptides were detectable in the post-infection sera from 23 51% 27 60% and 19 42% of 45 patients respectively these three peptides recognized by their long-lasting immunity may provide a better understanding of the immunogenicity of sars-cov a novel coronavirus sars-cov was discovered in association with the cases of life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that occurred in march of 2003 1 2 the genome of the sars-cov is 29727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses 3 since march of 2003 studies to determine immunogenic epitopes have been performed at a fast pace within a short period of time because of the urgent need to develop both therapeutic and diagnostic modalities for the sars-cov 4-8 the results of these studies indicate that both the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins of the sars-cov contain immunogenic regions howeverfurther studies are needed in order to identify the hot spots for which diagnostic and therapeutic tools can be developed in order to determine highly immunogenic regions an investigation was performed of sars-cov epitope peptides capable of inducing long-lasting immunity and the three candidate peptides have been reported in this study
human bocavirus was recently described as a novel member of the parvoviridae to infect humans based on accumulating clinical and epidemiological data the virus is currently being associated with respiratory infections in young children and infants and is furthermore discussed as causative agent of gastrointestinal illness
many vector-borne and zoonotic diseases are considered to be emerging since they are either newly reported to cause human disease or are causing disease in geographical locations or species not previously documented in the past 15 years significant outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome or mers nipah and hendra ebola virus disease and zika fever and others have been reported in this chapter the clinical characteristics epidemiological aspects treatment and prevention and information related to the laboratory investigation of important zoonotic and vector-borne diseases that have emerged in the past 10 years and how this affects children will be discussed furthermore rabies considered a neglected viral disease with the majority of victims in africa being children will also be addressed
the ongoing epidemic of chronic wasting disease cwd within cervid populations indicates the need for novel approaches for disease management a vaccine that either reduces susceptibility to infection or reduces shedding of prions by infected animals or a combination of both could be of benefit for disease control the development of such a vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of prion diseases and the requirement for formulation and delivery in an oral format for application in wildlife settings to address the unique nature of prions our group targets epitopes termed disease specific epitopes dses whose exposure for antibody binding depends on diseaseassociated misfolding of prp c into prp sc . here a dse corresponding to the rigid loop rl region which was immunogenic following parenteral vaccination was translated into an oral vaccine this vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent human adenovirus expressing a truncated rabies glycoprotein g recombinant fusion with the rl epitope had5tgg-rl oral immunization of white-tailed deer with had5tgg-rl induced prp sc -specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses with an encouraging safety profile in terms of no adverse health effects nor prolonged vector shedding by building upon proven strategies of formulation for wildlife vaccines these efforts generate a particular prp sc -specific oral vaccine for cwd as well as providing a versatile correspondence to scott napper 120 veterinary road platform in terms of carrier protein and biological vector for generation of other oral peptide-based cwd vaccines
• many parasites appear to exhibit host specificity • many parasites are also efficient in cross-species transmissions.• the above two phenomenon are largely incompatible without adaptive mutations • superinfection facilitates apparent host specificity and cross-species transmission a b s t r a c t parasites are either dedicated to a narrow host range or capable of exploiting a wide host range understanding how host ranges are determined is very important for public health as well as wildlife plant livestock and agricultural diseases our current understanding of host-parasite associations hinges on co-evolution which assumes evolved host preferences host specialization of the parasite despite the explanatory power of this framework we have only a vague understanding of why many parasites routinely cross the host species' barrier here we introduce a simple model demonstrating how superinfection in a heterogeneous community can promote host-parasite association strikingly the model illustrates that strong host-parasite association occurs in the absence of host specialization while still permitting cross-species transmission for decades host specialization has been foundational in explaining the maintenance of distinct parasites/strains in host species we argue that host specializations may be exaggerated and can occur as a byproduct not necessarily the cause of host-parasite associations
kawasaki disease causes systemic vasculitis the development of skin lesions at the vaccination site with bacillus calmette-guérin bcg is an important diagnostic symptom we hypothesized that infection with ubiquitous microorganisms immunogenically related to bcg might induce an immunopathologic reaction leading to the development of kawasaki disease mice were first inoculated with bcg and then secondarily inoculated 4 weeks later with crude extract from mycobacterium intracellulare cmi an abundant atypical mycobacterium animals inoculated with bcg followed by cmi developed coronary arteritis with infiltration of inflammatory cells whereas control animals inoculated with only cmi or bcg did not suggesting that the immune response to the mycobacteria induced autoimmunity to the vascular wall intravenous injection with antibodies to peroxiredoxin ii a modulator of vascular remodeling and a suggested target for autoimmune vasculitis also resulted in coronary arteritis but only after prior inoculation with bcg tumor necrosis factor-a mcp1 and interferon-g production were significantly higher in the animals inoculated with bcg than in the control groups p o 0.05 bcg immunization was required for the development of coronary arteritis suggesting that these cytokines might play important roles the results indicate that bcg induces primary autoimmunity and stimulates cytokine induction and that atypical mycobacterial infection boosts the autoimmunity resulting in coronary arteritis
since the refinement of tissue culture techniques for virus isolation and propagation from the mid 1960s onwards veterinary virology has received much academic and industrial interest and has now become a major global industry largely centred on vaccine development against economically important virus diseases of food animals bio-tech approaches have been widely used for improved vaccines development while many viral diseases are controlled through vaccination many still lack safe and efficacious vaccines additional challenges faced by academia industry and governments are likely to come from viruses jumping species and also from the emergence of virulent variants of established viruses due to natural mutations also viral ecology is changing as the respective vectors adapt to new habitats as has been shown in the recent incursion by bluetongue virus into europe in this paper the current vaccines for livestock horses and birds are described in a species by species order the new promising bio-tech approaches using reverse genetics non-replicating viral vectors alpha virus vectors and genetic vaccines in conjunction with better adjuvants and better ways of vaccine delivery are discussed as well
ebola viruses ebov are filamentous single-stranded rna viruses of the family filoviridae zaire ebolavirus zebov causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans great apes and non-human primates nhps with high fatality rates in contrast reston ebolavirus rebov the only species found outside africa is lethal to some nhps but has never been linked to clinical disease in humans despite documented exposure rebov was isolated from pigs in the philippines and subsequent experiments confirmed the susceptibility of pigs to both rebov and zebov with predilection for the lungs however only zebov caused severe lung pathology in 5-6 weeks old pigs leading to respiratory distress to further elucidate the mechanisms for lung pathology microarray analysis of changes in gene expression was performed on lung tissue from zebov-infected pigs furthermore systemic effects were monitored by looking at changes in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets and systemic cytokine responses following oro-nasal challenge zebov replicated mainly in the respiratory tract causing severe inflammation of the lungs and consequently rapid and difficult breathing neutrophils and macrophages infiltrated the lungs but only the latter were positive for zebov antigen genes for proinflammatory cytokines chemokines and acute phase proteins known to attract immune cells to sites of infection were upregulated in the lungs causing the heavy influx of cells into this site systemic effects included a decline in the proportion of monocyte/dendritic and b cells and a mild proinflammatory cytokine response serum igm was detected on day 5 and 6 post infection in conclusion a dysregulation/over-activation of the pulmonary proinflammatory response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of zebov infection in 5-6 weeks old pigs by attracting inflammatory cells to the lungs
the attenuation of infectious bronchitis ib qx-like virus strain l1148 is described the virus was passaged multiple times in embryonated specific pathogen free spf chicken eggs and at different passage levels samples were tested for safety for the respiratory tract and kidneys in 1-day-old spf chickens there was a clear decrease in pathogenicity for the respiratory tract and kidneys when the virus had undergone a large number of passages passage level 80 was investigated for safety for the reproductive tract in 1-day-old and 7-day-old spf chickens in 1-day-old chickens 12.5% of the vaccinated birds had macroscopic lesions no lesions were observed if the chickens had been vaccinated at 7 days of age passage level 80 was investigated for its ability to spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated chickens and for dissemination in the body the virus was able to spread from vaccinated chickens to groups of non-vaccinated chickens and in the vaccinated birds the virus was found frequently in oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs a fragment of the hypervariable region of the s1 protein of passage level 80 was sequenced and revealed nucleotide changes resulting in two amino acid substitutions passage level 80 was given additional passages to levels 82 and 85 both passage levels were tested for efficacy in spf chickens and passage level 85 was tested for efficacy in commercial chickens with maternally derived antibodies mda against a challenge with qx-like strain ib d388 in both spf chickens and chickens with mda the vaccines based on strain ib l1148 were efficacious against challenge viruses ib qx-like virus strain l1148 which was used for vaccine development was isolated from broilers with respiratory disease allantoic fluid from the seventh passage of strain ib l1148 in eggs was kindly provided
the aim of this study was to experimentally evaluate infection in gallus gallus domesticus with neospora caninum tachyzoites of the nc-1 strain experimental infection was conducted in 90-day-old chickens embryonated eggs and bioassays in dogs in the first experiment poults were randomly divided into four groups groups i and ii were provided feed with coccidiostat whereas groups iii and iv received feed without coccidiostat when the poults from groups i and iii reached 90 days of age they received a subcutaneous inoculation of n caninum once the hens entered their egg-laying period during the following 30 days the eggs were collected identified weighed and placed in an incubator on the 70th day after inoculation all animals including the chicks were euthanized tissue samples from the adult poultry and chicks were collected for histopathology immunohistochemistry ihc and pcr brain tissue and pectoral muscle samples from infected birds were fed to two dogs notably the average weight of the group iii eggs was lower than that of the group iv eggs p < 0.05 no changes consistent with infection in adult poultry or chicks were detected by histopathology or ihc moreover no amplified parasite dna was detected in the birds' tissues or dogs' feces no dog eliminated oocysts in the second experiment the embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 1 × 10 2 n caninum tachyzoites on the 10th day of incubation and chicks born from these eggs were housed in boxes suitable for the species and received commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum on the 30th day after infection dai the poultry were euthanized and their organs were processed as described in experiment i the amplification of parasite dna was observed in the spleen and pectoral muscles of one of the birds the ingestion of bird tissues by dogs did not result in oocyst elimination these results indicate that the parasite may have been eliminated by the host and that the use of tachyzoites to induce chronic disease might be a poor source for hens
foot-and-mouth disease fmd is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoof animals including cattle swine sheep goats and lots of wild species effectively control measures are urged needed here we showed that homoharringtonine treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against two different strains of fmdvs o/mya98/by/2010 and a/gd/mm/2013 in swine kidney ibrs-2 cells further experiments demonstrated that homoharringtonine did not affect virus attachment or entry using time-of-addition assays we found that the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine occurred primarily during the early stage of infection these results demonstrated that homoharringtonine might be an effective anti-fmdv drug further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine against fmdv replication in vivo k e y w o r d s antiviral fmdv homoharringtonine rna virus viral replication
ownership of companion animals or pets is popular throughout the world unfortunately such animals are susceptible to and potential reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens close proximity to and contact with pets can lead to human infections the distribution of zoonotic diseases associated with companion animals such as dogs and cats is not uniform around the world and moving animals between regions countries and continents carries with it the risk of relocating the pathogens they might harbor critical among these zoonotic diseases are rabies echinococcosis and leishmania in addition the protozoan parasites toxoplasma gondii and giardia duodenalis are also significant agents for human disease of pet origin considerable effort is applied to controlling movements of companion animals particularly dogs into the european union however free movement of people and their pets within the european union is a risk factor for the translocation of diseases and their vectors this review considers the current distribution of some of these diseases the risks associated with pet travel and the controls implemented within europe to prevent the free movement of zoonotic pathogens
background rift valley fever virus rvfv a member of the genus phlebovirus within the family bunyaviridae is a negativestranded rna virus with a tripartite genome rvfv is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates methodology/principal findings sequence analysis showed that a wild-type rvfv zh501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of m segment m847 one had a g residue at m847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope gn protein while the other carried a residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site two zh501-derived viruses rzh501-m847-g and rzh501-m847-a carried identical genomic sequences except that the former and the latter had g and a respectively at m847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system intraperitoneal inoculation of rzh501-m847-a into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera livers spleens kidneys and brains and killed most of the mice within 8 days whereas rzh501-m847-g caused low viremia titers did not replicate as efficiently as did rzh501-m847-a in these organs and had attenuated virulence to mice remarkably as early as 2 days postinfection with rzh501-m847-g the viruses carrying a at m847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter while replicating viruses retained the input a residue at m847 in rzh501-m847-a-infected mice conclusions/significance these data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the gn protein substantially affected the rvfv mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus

since 2012 mers-cov has caused up to 2220 cases and 790 deaths in 27 countries with saudi arabia being the most affected country with~83.1% of the cases and~38.8% local death rate current serological assays such as microneutralization mn plaque reduction neutralization immunofluorescence protein microarray or pseudoparticle neutralization assays rely on handling of live mers-cov in high containment laboratories or need for expensive and special equipment and reagents and highly trained personnel which represent a technical hurdle for most laboratories in resource-limited mers-cov endemic countries here we developed compared and evaluated three different indirect elisas based on mers-cov nucleocapsid protein n spike s ectodomain amino acids 1-1297 and s1 subunit amino acids 1-725 and compared them with mn assay the developed elisas were evaluated using large number of confirmed seropositive 79 samples and seronegative 274 samples mers-cov human serum samples both rs1-and rs-elisas maintained high sensitivity and specificity ≥90% across a wider range of od values compared to rn-elisa moreover rs1-and rs-based elisas showed better agreement and correlation with mn assay in contrast to rn-elisa collectively our data demonstrate that rs1-elisa and rs-elisa are more reliable than rn-elisa and represent a suitable choice for seroepidemiological testing and surveillance in mers-cov endemic regions several mers-cov serological assays have been developed and https//doi
middle east respiratory syndrome mers is an acute high-mortality-rate severe infectious disease caused by an emerging mers coronavirus mers-cov that causes severe respiratory diseases the continuous spread and great pandemic potential of mers-cov make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines we previously demonstrated that the application of gram-positive enhancer matrix gem particles as a bacterial vector displaying the mers-cov receptor-binding domain rbd is a very promising mers vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies we have also used the rabies virus rv as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the mers-cov s1 spike protein on the surface of the rv in this study we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in balb/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses the results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the gem particles vector however the gem particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response even at a very low dose of 1 µg these results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model this discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for mers-cov vaccine development but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens
the hsv-1 envelope glycoprotein b gb plays a critical role in virus entry into host cells neutralizing antibodies can therefore potentially prevent virus entry into target cells and cell-to-cell spread of infection our present study focused on the selection of neutralizing single-chain fv scfv antibodies of a phage-displayed nonimmune human scfv antibody library against gb of hsv-1 to enrich specific scfvs two phage antibodies were isolated against amino acid residues 31-43 derived from the n-terminal part of gb using panning technique two scfvs scfv-gb 1 and scfv-gb 2 with frequencies of 45% and 20% were obtained from scfv clones after performing pcr and mvai fingerprinting in phage elisa analysis both gb 1 and gb 2 scfvs demonstrated high reactivity with the gb peptide in the neutralization assay scfv-gb 1 and scfv-gb 2 represented neutralizing effects of 55% and 59% respectively upon further enhancement of the neutralizing effects of these antibodies they can be considered as new potential alternatives in the treatment and prophylaxis of hsv-1 infections
bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv is a worldwide spreading pestivirus affecting cattle and other ruminants however there have been few reports on epidemiologic investigation of bvdv in eastern china in this study bulk tank milk from 36 herds of dairy cattle in eastern china was submitted to serological investigations 77.8% of herds was bvdv antibody positive individual animal status in two herds was further investigated collecting blood samples the positive ratio was 49.74% and 24.64% and the average positive ratio of calves heifers and lactating cows was 15.94% 40.16% and 41.7% respectively moreover clinical survey was carried out among 8170 dairy cattle from 36 herds for diarrhea syndrome respiratory problems and reproductive failure and pathogens of all clinical cattle were further investigated the results showed that bvdv was one of the main pathogen which infected animals combining with various other viruses then nine bvdv strains were isolated phylogenetic analysis showed that bvdv subtypes currently circulating in eastern china were bvdv 1a and bvdv 1c in addition out of 377 cows tested the 1.86% detected positive to the bvdv antigen this study provided the foundation of further study on vaccination and control strategies of bvdv in eastern china
background as the major causative agent of swine viral diarrhea porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused massive losses to the economies of swine raising countries accordingly the serological detection of corresponding antibodies would be beneficial to diagnose pedv indirectly to control the disease in this study an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the recombinant truncated spike s protein of pedv was developed and validated results the reaction conditions of the developed indirect elisa were optimized this indirect elisa was compared to indirect immunoinfluscent assay ifa and the overall coincidence rate was 96.74% based on testing 368 clinical serum samples with different pedv antibody levels no cross-reactivity with other common swine pathogens was detected for the developed s1 indirect elisa finally the s1 indirect elisa was applied to detect serum antibodies of 3304 field samples collected from different pig farms in eastern china and it presented an overall substantial agreement on the pedv infection status conclusions this established s1 indirect elisa is capable of detecting serum antibodies against pedv and due to its high sensitivity and specificity it could be applied for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of pedv infection
background one of the most commonly applied protectotype vaccination protocol against infectious bronchitis ib in broiler chickens in the eu is simultaneous or alternate use of ma5 and 4/91 vaccine strains after ib vaccination and infection systemic and upper respiratory tract urt humoral and cell-mediated immunity cmi are stimulated the level of this stimulation correlates with the level of protection against ib results we've investigated the development of urt and systemic cell-mediated and humoral immunity in commercial broiler chickens vaccinated with ma5 and/or 4/91 strains at hatch day we've demonstrated that the group vaccinated with ma5 and 4/91 strain simultaneously developed the most desirable immunity which reflects the level of cd8 + t cells stimulation in spleen and harderian gland as well as the level of iga and igy in urt washings and serum and their cross-reactivity with 7 ibv strains conclusions although we did not demonstrate directly why ma5 + 4/91 protocol is so efficient it seems that it combines the benefits of monovalent vaccination with either ma5 or 4/91 and while ma5 seems to stimulate cmi more efficiently the 4/91 strain generates a wider spectrum of immune system cross-reactivity and higher urt iga production

emerging and reemerging viral diseases of livestock and human beings are in sharp rise in recent years importantly many of these viruses including influenza hendra nipah and corona are of zoonotic importance several viral diseases of livestock such as bluetongue peste des petits ruminants camel pox equine infectious anaemia chicken anaemia and sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever are crossing their traditional boundaries emergence of new serotypes and variant forms of viruses as in the case of blue tongue virus avian infectious bronchitis virus newcastle disease virus adds additional level of complexity the increased incidence of emerging and reemerging viral diseases could be attributed to several factors including deforestation and surge in direct contact of livestock and humans with wild animals and birds this special issue of ''indian journal of virology'' is focused on diverse aspects of above diseases isolation and characterization of viruses epidemiology pathogenesis diagnosis prevention measures and vaccine development
viral infections are frequently cited as a major environmental factor involved in subacute thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroid diseases this review examines the data related to the role of viruses in the development of thyroiditis our research has been focused on human data we have reviewed virological data for each type of thyroiditis at different levels of evidence epidemiological data serological data or research on circulating viruses direct evidence of thyroid tissue infection interpretation of epidemiological and serological data must be cautious as they don't prove that this pathogen is responsible for the disease however direct evidence of the presence of viruses or their components in the organ are available for retroviruses hfv and mumps in subacute thyroiditis for retroviruses htlv-1 hfv hiv and sv40 in graves's disease and for htlv-1 enterovirus rubella mumps virus hsv ebv and parvovirus in hashimoto's thyroiditis however it remains to determine whether they are responsible for thyroid diseases or whether they are just innocent bystanders further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between viruses and thyroid diseases in order to develop new strategies for prevention and/or treatment
the global vaccine market is diverse while facing a plethora of novel developments genetic modification gm techniques facilitate the design of 'smarter' vaccines for many of the major infectious diseases of humans like aids and malaria but also for most human neoplastic disorders still no vaccines are available it may be speculated that novel gm technologies will significantly contribute to their development while a promising number of studies is conducted on gm vaccines and gm vaccine technologies the contribution of gm technology to newly introduced vaccines on the market is disappointingly limited in this study the field of vector-based gm vaccines is explored data on currently available actually applied and newly developed vectors is retrieved from various sources synthesised and analysed in order to provide an overview on the use of vector-based technology in the field of gm vaccine development while still there are only two vector-based vaccines on the human vaccine market there is ample activity in the fields of patenting preclinical research and different stages of clinical research results of this study revealed that vector-based vaccines comprise a significant part of all gm vaccines in the pipeline this study further highlights that poxviruses and adenoviruses are among the most prominent vectors in gm vaccine development after the approval of the first vectored human vaccine based on a flavivirus vector vaccine vector technology especially based on poxviruses and adenoviruses holds great promise for future vaccine development
swine influenza viruses siv regularly cause significant disease in pigs worldwide since there is no causative treatment of siv we tested if probiotic enterococcus e faecium ncimb 10415 or zinc zn oxide as feed supplements provide beneficial effects upon siv infection in piglets seventy-two weaned piglets were fed three different diets containing either e faecium or different levels of zn 2500 ppm zn high 50 ppm zn low . half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly vac twice with an inactivated trivalent siv vaccine while all piglets were then infected intranasally with h3n2 siv significantly higher weekly weight gains were observed in the e faecium group before virus infection and piglets in zn high and e faecium groups gained weight after infection while those in the control group zn low lost weight using elisa we found significantly higher h3n2-specific antibody levels in the e faecium+vac group 2 days before and at the day of challenge infection as well as at 4 and 6 days after challenge infection higher hemagglutination inhibition hi titers were also observed in the zn high +vac and e faecium+vac groups at 0 1 and 4 days after infection however there were no significant differences in virus shedding and lung lesions between the dietary groups using flow cytometry analysis significantly higher activated t helper cells and cytotoxic t lymphocyte percentages in the pbmcs were detected in the zn high and e faecium groups at single time points after infection compared to the zn low control group but no prolonged effect was found in the bal cells no influence of dietary supplementation on immune cell percentages could be detected our results suggest that feeding high doses of zinc oxide and particularly e faecium could beneficially influence humoral immune responses after vaccination and recovery from siv infection but not affect virus shedding and lung pathology

vaccines have been the single most significant advancement in public health preventing morbidity and mortality in millions of people annually vaccine development has traditionally focused on whole organism vaccines either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines while successful for many different infectious diseases whole organisms are expensive to produce require culture of the infectious agent and have the potential to cause vaccine associated disease in hosts with advancing technology and a desire to develop safe cost effective vaccine candidates the field began to focus on the development of recombinantly expressed antigens known as subunit vaccines while more tolerable subunit vaccines tend to be less immunogenic attempts have been made to increase immunogenicity with the addition of adjuvants either immunostimulatory molecules or an antigen delivery system that increases immune responses to vaccines an area of extreme interest has been the application of nanotechnology to vaccine development which allows for antigens to be expressed on a particulate delivery system one of the most exciting examples of nanovaccines are rationally designed protein nanoparticles these nanoparticles use some of the basic tenants of structural biology biophysical chemistry and vaccinology to develop protective safe and easily manufactured vaccines rationally developed nanoparticle vaccines are one of the most promising candidates for the future of vaccine development
the protective effect of egg yolk and colostrum powders prepared from hens and cows vaccinated with inactivated bovine coronavirus bcv antigen was evaluated in a challenge model with a virulent bcv strain twenty three calves from bcv-free herds were randomly divided into control and several treatment groups all calves were orally challenged with 1 x 10 9 tcidso of the virulent kakegawa strain of bcv at 24 to 36 h after birth calves in treatment groups received either egg yolk powder or cow colostrum containing bcv specific antibodies daily treatment with these antibody preparations started 6 h until 7 days post-challenge control calves which received no antibody had severe diarrhea and all died within 6 days after infection in contrast calves fed milk containing egg yolk or colostrum with neutralization titers of 12560 or 110 240 respectively all survived and had positive weight gain unlike the other treatment groups these results indicate that the orally administered egg yolk and colostrum powders protected against bcv-induced diarrhea in neonatal calves and that the egg yolk used provided a higher degree of protection compared to colostrum powder on a titer basis treatment with whole egg yolk from immunized hens therefore provides a more efficacious alternative to the existing methods of specific passive protection against bcv © 1997 elsevier science b v
epizootic outbreaks of diarrhoeas have emerged and disseminated in different rabbit farms in mexico causing great economical losses during the past years seven 5-weeks-old new zealand white nzw rabbits chosen at random from 35 ill animals that were remitted for postmortem histopathology and ultrastructural examinations were studied bacteriological and parasitological studies were carried out in three additional ill rabbits of same age in a field trail 45 5-weeks-old apparently healthy nzw rabbits were observed daily for sanitary status for a 5-week period some of the rabbits did not response to the preventive drug treatment and were therefore used to study the development of the disease clinical signs gross lesions and mortality throughout the fattening period were recorded eight 8-weeks-old nzw rabbits who survived an outbreak were assessed for gamma-globulins in serum of the total protein fraction during a 3week period gamma-globulins were also measured in eight free-disease healthy rabbits of same breed and age lesions of the small intestine consisted of mucoid enteropathy lymphocytic plasmocytic enteritis with atrophy and fusion of villi and hyperplasia of globet cells serosal edema was present ultrastructural examinations of jejunum and ileum from 3/7 diseased rabbits revealed enterocytes in apoptosis mixed with degenerative and/or necrotic changes together with infiltration of lymphocytes macrophages neutrophils and loss of microvillus there were electron dense structures suggestive of virus particles inside the nuclei and cytoplasm of some enterocytes there was lymphoid spleen atrophy and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in 7/7 rabbits interstitial pneumonia in 4/7 rabbits was found encephalitozoon cuniculi was detected in the brain of 1/7 rabbits escherichia coli were detected in 3/3 cases and eimeria spp in 2/3 cases mortality rate in the field study was 51.1% and the spread of the disease occur in 9/9 cages the proportion of gamma-globulins in rabbits who survive an outbreak was much lower p = 0.0001 than free-disease healthy rabbits 8.1 ± 1.0 and 14.0 ± 1.0 respectively the disease was multifactorial and consisted of sub-acute mucoid enteropathy probably induced by viral infection and aggravated by the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens common to rabbits this may explain the severe degenerative and necrotic changes observed in the small intestine of diarrhoeic rabbits
the recent emergence of bat-borne zoonotic viruses warrants vigilant surveillance in their natural hosts of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and most recently coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from wuhan china in december 2019 viral detection discovery and surveillance activities were undertaken in myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people free-ranging bats were captured and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses three novel alphacoronaviruses three novel betacoronaviruses and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in myanmar ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in myanmar bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales
cryptosporidium parvum is recognized as one of the most important pathogens causing enteritis and severe diarrhoea in calves up to 1 month of age although the infection may be responsible for some mortality its impact is mainly associated with the impairment of intestinal functions and lower performance of animals the aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on the intestinal functions in neonatal experimentally infected holstein calves absorption tests with d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate and the lactulose/mannitol test of intestinal permeability were simultaneously performed in 1-week intervals from challenge to full recovery in infected animals reduced intestinal absorptive capacity for both d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate was observed on day 7 post-infection p i at the same time a more than 100% elevation of intestinal permeability was observed in the infected calves all intestinal functions except absorption of retinyl-palmitate were significantly affected and changes were
humans and nonhuman primates are phylogenetically i e genetically related and share pathogens that can jump from one species to another the specific strategies of three groups of pathogens for crossing the species barrier among primates will be discussed in africa gorillas and chimpanzees have succumbed for years to simultaneous epizootics i e ''multi-emergence'' of ebola virus in places where they are in contact with chiropters which could be animal reservoirs of these viruses human epidemics often follow these major outbreaks simian immunodeficiency viruses sivs have an ancient history of coevolution and many interspecific exchanges with their natural hosts chimpanzee and gorilla sivs have crossed the species barrier at different times and places leading to the emergence of hiv-1 and hiv-2 other retroviruses such as the simian t-lymphotropic viruses and foamiviruses have also a unique ancient or recent history of crossing the species barrier the identification of gorilla plasmodium parasites that are genetically close to p falciparum suggests that gorillas were the source of the
1 avian influenza ai viruses primarily circulate in wild waterfowl populations and are occasionally transmitted to domestic poultry flocks however the possible roles of other wildlife species such as wild mammals in ai virus ecology have not been adequately addressed.2 due to their habitat and behaviour many wild mammals may be capable of transmitting pathogens among wild and domestic populations exposure to ai viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals the presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry ai outbreak in north america these reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to ai viruses 3 serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry domestic swine and human exposure to influenza a viruses but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals as such some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals herein we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in ai surveillance of wild mammals we call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains
the aim of this study was to evaluate some immunological patterns involved in natural and acquired resistance against mhv3 using the original model of genetically modified lines of mice selected for high h iii and low l iii antibody responsiveness as previously shown a lower pre-existing anti-mhv antibody level was found in susceptible h iii mice as compared to resistant l iii mice mortality rates of the f 1 h â l hybrids and f 2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher preexisting anti-mhv antibody titers the present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible h iii mice paralleled the antibody synthesis nevertheless higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in h iii mice than in l iii ones when compared to uvmhv3 a single immunization with a related infectious mhv strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the h iii mice to resist the mhv3 challenge a direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in h iii mice although mounting a th2 response as indicated by igg1 responses they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of igg2a antibodies after immunization or during infection reflecting a th1 response the transfer of anti-mhv antibodies to susceptible h iii mice was capable of conferring resistance to mhv3 providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts the resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered if these direct and clear data suggest that h iii mice can acquire resistance through antibodies the basis of the resistance of the resistant l iii mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies
hepatitis e is an acute human liver disease in healthy individuals which may eventually become chronic it is caused by the hepatitis e virus hev and can have a zoonotic origin nearly 57000 people die yearly from hepatitis e-related conditions the disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles in developing countries the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment while in developed countries transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat especially liver all human hev are grouped into at least four genotypes while hev or hev-related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species despite a high genetic diversity only one single hev serotype has been described to date for hev genotypes 1-4 the discovery of new hev or hev-related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes in addition the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames orf and differences in the location of orf3 in spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir the origin of hev and hev-related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear this review discusses aspects of the detection molecular virology zoonotic transmission and origin of hev and hev-related viruses in the context of 'one health' and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family
three sets of blood samples were obtained from beef calves of two experimental populations and assayed for various immunological measurements the first set of samples was taken between 24 and 48 h after birth and quantified for igg~ concentration a second set was taken immediately prior to vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus ibrv at an average age of 164 d and a third set taken 60 d post-vaccination these later samples were quantified for antibodies specific to 1brv level of complement c3 was also quantified in the samples taken immediately prior to vaccination three hundred sixty-seven calves were from four hereford lines three lines were previously selected for growth traits and the fourth was a randomly selected control line there were no consistent differences in immune traits among these lines the second group of 165 animals were angus hereford and red poll calves while angus calves had a higher mean igg t concentration at 24 to 48 h of age than hereford or red poll calves no differences among breeds were found for the other immune traits measured calves from older dams >3 yr old tended to have higher mean lgga concentrations pre-vaccination ibrv antibody titers and complement c3 levels than calves from 2-and 3-yr-old cows however these calves had lower 60-d post-vaccination ibrv titers than calves from the younger cows p<.05 as pre-vaccination i brv antibody titer increased post-vaccination ibrv antibody titer decreased p<.05 all pooled heritability estimates did not differ significantly from 0 range -.06 + .08 to .21 +-.12 nor were there significant phenotypic associations between the immune traits and growth performance
background canine parvovirus 2 cpv 2 is a major infectious cause of mortality in puppies the characteristic symptom of cpv 2 disease is intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea soon after cpv was first recognized in the late 1970s the original virus cpv 2 was replaced in the canine population by strains carrying minor antigenic variants termed 2a 2b and 2c of the vp2 gene that could be distinguished using monoclonal antibodies and molecular analyses here we provide an updated molecular characterization of the cpv 2 circulating in taiwan methods in this study 28 isolates of cpv 2 from 144 dogs with suspected cpv infection were obtained from northern central and southern taiwan from 2008 to 2012 and screened by pcr the 28 isolates were sequenced and a phylogenetic analysis of the vp2 gene was performed results of the 28 taiwanese cpv 2 isolates 15 were identified as new cpv 2a and 13 were identified as new cpv 2b compared to the reference cpv 2a all 15 of the cpv 2a sequences collected in this study contain an ile324 mutation caused by a tat to att mutation at nucleotides 970-972 of the vp2 gene conclusion our vp2 sequence data revealed that both types are currently prevalent cpv 2 field strains circulating in taiwan and a unique ile324 vp2 mutation was found in our taiwanese cpv 2a isolates and recent asian isolates cpv 2c was not observed in this study
bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity although several of these viruses are zoonotic the majority are not astroviruses transmitted fecal-orally are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans these features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history epidemiology in the host and temporal shedding trends our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in singapore reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection of the seven species screened astroviruses were detected in rhinolophus lepidus and eonycteris spelaea the r lepidus sequences grouped with other rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from china and laos while the eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from rousettus spp in laos and pteropus giganteus in bangladesh but not with other e spelaea sequences longitudinal collections of eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses this study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats it also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness host ecology such as roosting behavior may drive co-infections virus maintenance and spillover
background infection control measures have played a major role in limiting human/camel-to-human transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov however development of effective and safe human or camel vaccines is warranted methods we extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 rad5-based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and cd40-mediated specific responses to generate mers-cov s1 subunit-based vaccine we generated rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein rad5-s1/f/cd40l untargeted s1 rad5-s1 and green fluorescent protein rad5-gfp and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic hdpp4 tg + mice results immunization of hdpp4 tg + mice with a single dose of rad5-s1/f/cd40l elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin g and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rad5-s1 after mers-cov challenge both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group however rad5-s1-but not rad5-s1/f/cd40l-immunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage post-mers-cov challenge despite the observed protection conclusions incorporation of cd40l into rad5-based mers-cov s1 vaccine targeting molecule and molecular adjuvants not only enhances immunogenicity and efficacy but also prevents inadvertent pulmonary pathology after viral challenge thereby offering a promising strategy to enhance safety and potency of vaccines
canine parvovirus type 2 cpv2 is one of the most important intestinal pathogens in dogs and puppies cpv2 has been evolved into three genetic and antigenic variants 2a 2b and 2c which are distributed worldwide we reported the first study of genetic diversity of cpv2 in chile sixty-five samples were collected from puppies presenting with severe gastroenteritis and different vaccination statuses pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp and partial sequencing of the coding region of the structural viral protein vp2 was performed thirty of a total of 65 samples tested positive by pcr out of which 19 were further classified as cpv2c and one as cpv2a using rflp and sanger sequencing the phylogeny was in concordance with the rflp analysis this is the first report of the genetic characterization of cpv2 in chile and reveals a high occurrence of cpv2c
background canine distemper virus cdv is a major pathogen of dogs and wild carnivores worldwide in switzerland distemper in domestic dogs is rarely reported in recent years the import of dogs from eastern europe to switzerland has steadily increased in the present study we describe a distemper outbreak in 15 rescue dogs that were imported from hungary to switzerland by an animal welfare organisation the data on vaccination and medical history were recorded 14 dogs and the samples were collected to investigate cdv and vector-borne infections 13 dogs and canine parvovirus infection 12 dogs the dogs were monitored for six months results one dog was euthanised directly after import thirteen dogs showed clinical signs after arrival i e diarrhoea 57 % coughing 43 % and nasal and/or ocular discharge 21 % radiographic findings that were compatible with bronchopneumonia were present in four dogs cdv infection was diagnosed in 11 dogs 85 % 10 dogs 91 % tested pcr-positive in conjunctival swabs vector-borne infections babesia spp leishmania infantum dirofilaria immitis were found in 4 dogs 31 %. three dogs were hospitalized and six dogs received ambulatory therapy for up to two months until recovery none of the dogs developed neurological disease cdv shedding was detected for a period of up to four months because dogs were put under strict quarantine until cdv shedding ceased cdv did not spread to any other dogs the cdv isolates showed 99 % sequence identity in the ha gene among each other and belonged to the arctic-like lineage of cdv the present study highlights the imminent risks of spreading contagious viral and vector-borne infections through the non-selective import of sick dogs and dogs with incomplete vaccination from eastern europe cdv shedding was detected for several months after the cessation of clinical signs which emphasised the roles of asymptomatic carriers in cdv epidemiology a long-term follow-up using sensitive pcr and strict quarantine measures is of upmost importance in preventing the spread of infection dog owners and animal welfare organisations should be educated regarding the importance of complete vaccinations and the impact of dog imports on the spread of viral and vector-borne pathogens

influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases endangering the health of humans especially young children and the elderly although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza frequent mutations in viral surface antigens low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines however no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the united states in this study we found that a novel adjuvant rov-asp-1 co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model rov-asp-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine allowing antigen-sparring by 10-fold the rov-asp-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum importantly rov-asp-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain these results demonstrate that rov-asp-1 is an effective adjuvant that 1 accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine 2 allows for antigen sparing and 3 augments a th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain
collagen-induced arthritis is a b cell-mediated autoimmune disease recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and nagana in livestock in sub-saharan endemic areas in the past we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair b cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens hence here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of cia by specifically dampening specific b-cell responses and type ii collagen antibody titers in dba/1 prone mice we observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in t brucei-infected dba/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type ii collagen titers of the different igg isotypes in the serum treatment of infected mice with berenil a trypanocidal drug restored the development of cia-associated clinical symptoms interestingly these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized dba/1 prone mice with t brucei-infected tsetse flies together these results demonstrate that t brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma b cell pool driving the development of cia in dba/1 prone mice
japanese encephalitis virus jev is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus persisting in pigs ardeid birds and culex mosquitoes it is endemic to china and southeastern asia the case-fatality ratio cfr or the rate of permanent psychiatric sequelae is 30% among symptomatic patients there were no reported local jev human cases between 2006 and 2010 in hong kong but it was followed by a resurgence of cases from 2011 to 2017 the mechanism behind this "skip-and-resurgence" patterns is unclear this work aims to reveal the mechanism behind the "skip-and-resurgence" patterns using mathematical modelling and likelihood-based inference techniques we found that pig-to-pig transmission increases the size of jev epidemics but is unlikely to maintain the same level of transmission among pigs the disappearance of jev human cases in 2006-2010 could be explained by a sudden reduction of the population of farm pigs as a result of the implementation of the voluntary "pig-rearing licence surrendering" policy the resurgence could be explained by of a new strain in 2011 which increased the transmissibility of the virus or the spill-over ratio from reservoir to host or both
the live-attenuated measles virus mv vaccine based on the hu191 strain has played a significant role in controlling measles in china however it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden we hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of mv vaccine can be improved by altering the s-adenosylmethionine sam binding site in the conserved region vi of the large polymerase protein to test this hypothesis we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rmv-hu191 strain and generated two recombinant mv-hu191 carrying mutations in the sam binding site these two mutants grew to high titer in vero cells were genetically stable and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rmv-hu191 vaccine strain importantly both mv-hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rmv-hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against mv challenge these results demonstrate its potential for an improved mv vaccine candidate

a genogroup 2b g2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv taiwan pintung 52 pedvpt strain was isolated in 2014 the pathogenicity and host antibody responses elicited by low-passage passage 5 pedvpt-p5 and high-passage passage 96 pedvpt-p96 pedvpt strains were compared in post-weaning pedv-seronegative pigs by oral inoculation pedvpt-p5-inoculation induced typical diarrhea during 1-9 days post inoculation with fecal viral shedding persisting for 26 days compared to pedvpt-p5 pedvpt-p96 inoculation induced none-to-mild diarrhea and lower delayed fecal viral shedding although pedvpt-p96 elicited slightly lower neutralizing antibodies and pedv-specific immunoglobulin g igg and immunoglobulin a iga titers a reduction in pathogenicity and viral shedding of the subsequent challenge with pedvpt-p5 were noted in both pedvpt-p5-and pedvpt-p96-inoculated pigs alignment and comparison of full-length sequences of pedvpt-p5 and pedvpt-p96 revealed 23 nucleotide changes and resultant 19 amino acid substitutions in non-structure proteins 2 3 4 9 14 15 spike open reading frame 3 orf3 and membrane proteins with no detectable deletion or insertion the present study confirmed the pathogenicity of the pedvpt isolate in conventional post-weaning pigs moreover data regarding viral attenuation and potency of induced antibodies against pedvpt-p5 identified pedvpt-p96 as a potential live-attenuated vaccine candidate
powassan virus powv is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus presenting a public health threat in north america powv lineage ii also known as deer tick virus is the strain of the virus most frequently found in ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of powv encephalitis in the united states currently no commercial tests are available to detect powv exposure in tick-borne disease tbd patients we describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect powv infections the panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay eia to screen eia-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed powvspecific immunofluorescence assay ifa the analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89% and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test prnt titer of 120 the analytical specificity was 100% for the igm assay and 65% for the igg assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested on samples collected from regions where lyme disease is endemic seroprevalence for powv in tbd samples was 9.4% 10 of 106 versus 2% when tested with non-tbd samples 2 of 100 p ϭ 0.034 no evidence of powv infection was seen in samples collected from a region where lyme disease was not endemic 0 of 22 this test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to powv early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable combined with clinical history the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute powv infection
the domestic ferret mustela putorius furo is an important mammalian animal model to study human respiratory infection however insufficient genomic annotation hampers detailed studies of ferret t cell responses in this study we analyzed the published t cell receptor beta trb locus and performed high-throughput sequencing hts of peripheral blood of four healthy adult ferrets to identify expressed v d j and c genes the hts data is used as a guide to manually curate the expressed v d j and c genes the ferret locus appears to be most similar to that of the dog like other mammalian trb loci the ferret trb locus contains a library of variable genes located upstream of two d-j-c gene clusters followed by a in the ferret non-functional v gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation all trb genes expressed or not reported here have been approved by the imgt/who-iuis nomenclature committee
despite of the role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for threatening viral diseases for wild carnivores few studies have focused to identify circulation of viruses among dogs living in human/wildlife interfaces to identify canine parvovirus cpv types circulating in dogs living in an atlantic forest biome faecal samples n = 100 were collected at the same period one week corresponding to each of four areas during 2014 to 2016 and corresponded to 100 different individuals cpv was isolated in cell culture from 67 out 100 67% samples from healthy dogs cytopathic effects were characterized by total or partial cell culture lysis genome sequences of cpv-2a 10% cpv-2b 7% and cpv-2c 50% were concomitantly detected by pcr and nucleotide sequencing the current study addresses the importance of monitoring cpv circulation among dogs presenting potential contact with wildlife species
the difficulties related to virus taxonomy have been amplified by recent advances in next-generation sequencing and metagenomics prompting the field to revisit the question of what constitutes a useful viral classification here taking a challenging classification found in coronaviruses we argue that consideration of biological properties in addition to sequence-based demarcations is critical for generating useful taxonomy that recapitulates complex evolutionary histories within the alphacoronavirus genus the alphacoronavirus 1 species encompasses several biologically distinct viruses we carried out functionally based phylogenetic analysis centered on the spike gene which encodes the main surface antigen and primary driver of tropism and pathogenesis within the alphacoronavirus 1 species we identify clade a encompassing serotype i feline coronavirus and canine coronavirus and clade b grouping serotype ii fcov and ccov and transmissible gastroenteritis virus -like viruses we propose this clade designation along with the newly proposed alphacoronavirus 2 species as an improved way to classify the alphacoronavirus genus importance our work focuses on improving the classification of the alphacoronavirus genus the alphacoronavirus 1 species groups viruses of veterinary importance that infect distinct mammalian hosts and includes canine and feline coronaviruses and transmissible gastroenteritis virus it is the prototype species of the alphacoronavirus genus however it encompasses biologically distinct viruses to better characterize this prototypical species we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the spike protein one of the main determinants of tropism and pathogenesis and reveal the existence of two subgroups or clades that fit with previously established serotype demarcations we propose a new clade designation to better classify alphacoronavirus 1 members
human coronavirus strain 229e hcov-229e and human alphaherpesvirus 1 were isolated from the plasma of a haitian child in 2016 with suspected arbovirus diseases to our knowledge this is the first description of hcov-229e in human plasma which is the focus of this article
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes severe diarrhea and mortality in piglets robust immunity may break the transmission cycle expression of antigens in maize grains is a promising method for producing low-cost vaccines as a first step we expressed maize constructs containing pedv s1 spike protein targeted to various cellular locations including the cell wall endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole and fused to carrier proteins e coli heat labile subunit ltb and a dendritic cell dc binding peptide and obtained sufficient antigen for oral immunization constructs targeting s1 to the er or fused to carrier proteins produced high levels of antigen of greater than 20 mg/kg oral administration to pigs elicited serum neutralizing antibodies supporting oral immunization as a practical and cost-effective pedv vaccine transgenic expression of spike protein antigen s1 from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in maize accumulated sufficient antigen for oral immunization and elicited serum neutralizing antibodies in pigs
the major physiological function of milk is the transport of amino acids carbohydrates lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring however milk is also a rich collection of antimicrobial substances which provide protection against pathogenic infections these molecules safeguard the integrity of the lactating mammary gland but also provide protection for the suckling offspring during a time when its immune system is still immature the protective substances can be classified into two categories 1 nonspecific defense substances which provide innate immunity and 2 molecules such as antibodies which provide adaptive immunity and are directed against specific pathogens the antimicrobial potency of milk has not been a target for farm animal breeding in the past and present day ruminants provide suboptimal levels of antimicrobial substances in milk altered breeding regimes pharmacological intervention and transgenesis can be utilized to improve the antimicrobial properties of milk such alterations of milk composition have implications for human and animal health
the human papillomavirus hpv vaccines consist of major capsid protein l1 virus-like particles vlp and are highly efficacious against the development of cervical cancer precursors attributable to oncogenic genotypes hpv16 and hpv18 a degree of vaccine-induced cross-protection has also been demonstrated against genetically-related genotypes in the alpha-7 hpv18-like and alpha-9 hpv16like species groups which is coincident with the detection of l1 cross-neutralising antibodies in this study the l1 domains recognised by inter-genotype cross-neutralising antibodies were delineated l1 crystallographic homology models predicted a degree of structural diversity between the l1 loops of hpv16 and the non-vaccine alpha-9 genotypes these structural predictions informed the design of chimeric pseudovirions with inter-genotype loop swaps which demonstrated that the l1 domains recognised by inter-genotype cross-neutralising antibodies comprise residues within the de loop and the late region of the fg loop these data contribute to our understanding of the l1 domains recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies such specificities may play a critical role in vaccineinduced cross-protection
mosquito-borne flaviviruses include several important agents of human disease and have provided striking examples of emerging infections in this study we present the design and validation of a single tube rt-pcr assay using a pair of consensus primers for the detection of mosquito-borne flaviviruses sequencing of the amplicons permits the species identification the assay was validated using rna from the yellow fever virus vaccine strain and from representative strains of dengue viruses 1 2 3 and 4 west nile virus kunjin virus a clade of west nile virus and st louis encephalitis virus
passive immunity pi acquired through colostrum intake is essential for piglet protection against pathogens maternallyderived antibodies mdas can decrease the transmission of pathogens between individuals by reducing shedding from infected animals and/or susceptibility of naïve animals only a limited number of studies however have been carried out to quantify the level of protection conferred by pi in terms of transmission in the present study an original modeling framework was designed to estimate parameters governing the transmission of infectious agents in the presence and absence of pi this epidemiological model accounts for the distribution of pi duration and two different forces of infection depending on the serological status of animals after colostrum intake a bayesian approach metropolis-hastings algorithm was used for parameter estimation the impact of pi on hepatitis e virus transmission in piglets was investigated using longitudinal serological data from six pig farms a strong impact of pi was highlighted the efficiency of transmission being on average 13 times lower in piglets with maternally-derived antibodies than in fully susceptible animals range 5-21 median infection-free survival ages based on herd-specific estimates ranged between 8.7 and 13.8 weeks in all but one herd indeed this herd exhibited a different profile with a relatively low prevalence of infected pigs 50% at slaughter age despite the similar proportions of passively immune individuals after colostrum intake these results suggest that the age at hev infection is not strictly dependent upon the proportion of piglets with pi but is also linked to farm-specific husbandry mingling of piglets after weaning and hygiene practices the original methodology developed here using populationbased longitudinal serological data was able to demonstrate the relative impact of mdas on the transmission of infectious agents
background apical membrane antigen 1 ama1 is one of the best-studied blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates when an ama1 vaccine was tested in a malaria naïve population it induced functionally active antibodies judged by growth inhibition assay gia however the same vaccine failed to induce higher growth-inhibitory activity in adults living in a malaria endemic area vaccination did induce functionally active antibodies in malaria-exposed children with less than 20% inhibition in gia at baseline but not in children with more than that level of baseline inhibition methods total iggs were purified from plasmas collected from the pediatric trial before and after immunization and pools of total iggs were made another set of total iggs was purified from u s adults immunized with ama1 us-total igg from these total iggs ama1-specific and non-ama1 iggs were affinity purified and the functional activity of these iggs was evaluated by gia competition elisa was performed with the u s.-total igg and non-ama1 iggs from malaria-exposed children results ama1-specific iggs from malaria-exposed children and u s vaccinees showed similar growth-inhibitory activity at the same concentrations when mixed with u s.-total igg non-ama1 iggs from children showed an interference effect in gia interestingly the interference effect was higher with non-ama1 iggs from higher titer pools the non-ama1 iggs did not compete with anti-ama1 antibody in u s.-total igg in the competition elisa conclusion children living in a malaria endemic area have a fraction of iggs that interferes with the biological activity of anti-ama1 antibody as judged by gia while the mechanism of interference is not resolved in this study these results suggest it is not caused by direct competition between non-ama1 igg and ama1 protein this study indicates that antimalaria iggs induced by natural exposure may interfere with the biological effect of antibody induced by an ama1-based vaccine in the target population
pteropine orthoreovirus prv is an emerging bat-borne human pathogen causing severe respiratory illness to date however the evaluation of prv virulence has largely depended on the limited numbers of clinical cases owing to the lack of animal models to develop an in vivo model of prv infection an inbred c3h mouse strain was infected intranasally with pathogenic prv strain miyazaki-bali/2007 c3h mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration following repeated intranasal infection mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of prv the results of these immunological assays will help to develop laboratory protocols for sero-epidemiological studies our small rodent model of lethal respiratory infection will further allow investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of prv
red foxes vulpes vulpes are the most abundant carnivore species in the northern hemisphere since their populations are well established in peri-urban and urban areas they represent a potential reservoir of viruses that transmit from wildlife to humans or domestic animals in this study we evaluated the faecal virome of juvenile and adult foxes from peri-urban areas in central croatia the dominating mammalian viruses were fox picobirnavirus and parvovirus the highest number of viral reads n = 1412 was attributed to a new fox circovirus and complete viral genome was de novo assembled from the highthroughput sequencing data fox circovirus is highly similar to dog circoviruses identified in diseased dogs in usa and italy and to a recently discovered circovirus of foxes with neurologic disease from the united kingdom our fox picobirnavirus was more closely related to the porcine and human picobirnaviruses than to known fox picobirnaviruses
bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia boop is a chronic respiratory disease although the pathogenesis of boop is still incompletely understood boop is responsive to steroids and has a good prognosis in our five pigs with chronic postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws typical boop lesions were revealed all five porcine lungs showed typical intraluminal plugs and porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 was identified they also exhibited similar pathologic findings such as proliferation of type ii pneumocytes and myofibroblasts mfbs extracellular collagen matrix ecm deposition and fragmentation of elastic fibers mfbs migration correlative molecules for instance gelatinase a b and osteopontin appeared strongly in the progressing marginal area of polypoid intraluminal plugs of fibrotic lesion these molecules colocalized with the active mfbs both gelatinase activity and intercellular level of active mfbs were significantly increased p < .05 porcine chronic bronchopneumonia leads to boop and it is associated with pcv2 persistent infection swine boop demonstrates similar cellular constituents with human boop perhaps their molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis operate in a similar way thus we infer that the swine boop can be considered as a potential animal model for human boop associated with natural viral infection moreover it is more convenient to obtain samples
following the sars outbreak extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats this study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the australasian region we identified four different genotypes of coronavirus three of which an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses are potentially new species having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses we did not detect any sars-like betacoronaviruses despite targeting rhinolophid bats the putative natural host taxa our findings support the virus-host coevolution hypothesis with the detection of miniopterus bat coronavirus hku8 previously reported in miniopterus species in china hong kong and bulgaria in australian miniopterus species similarly we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from pteropus alecto which is most closely related to bat coronavirus hku9 identified in other pteropodid bats in china kenya and the philippines we also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses thus our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects coevolution with the occasional host shift
background infectious diarrhea can be caused by bacteria viruses or protozoan organisms or a combination of these the identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established the objective of this study was to use a real-time pcr diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea as well the frequency in different countries feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus canine coronavirus canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 clostridium perfringens alpha toxin cpa cryptosporidium spp giardia spp and salmonella spp using molecular techniques results in total 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study overall 71/104 68.3% dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen a single infection in 39/71 dogs 54.9% and co-infections in 32/71 dogs 45.1% including 21/32 dogs 65.6% with dual 5/32 15.6% with triple and 6/32 18.8% with quadruple infections in the control group 13/43 30.2% dogs were positive all with single infections only the most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were cpa 40/104 dogs 38.5% cpv-2 36/104 dogs 34.6% and giardia spp 14/104 dogs 13.5%. cpv-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections associated with cpa cryptosporidium spp or giardia spp no statistical difference p = 0.8374 was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths p = 0.5722 in the presence or absence of single or co-infections conclusions diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections therefore multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors
over the past years biodiversity has been reduced on an unprecedented scale while new infectious diseases are emerging at an increasing rate greater overall biodiversity could lead to a greater diversity of hosts and thus of pathogens yet disease regulation -due to the buffering role of host diversity -is considered to be one of the services provided by biodiversity in this chapter we ask how biodiversity is linked to infectious disease first we investigate the influence of the biodiversity of pathogens we highlight that the number of pathogen species is not well known but that new findings are facilitated by the rapid expansion of molecular techniques we show that although there is a trend to find higher pathogen richness toward the equator identifying a global pattern between the richness of all pathogen species and their latitudinal distribution is challenging we emphasize that pathogen intraspecific diversity is a crucial factor in disease emergence and allows pathogens to adapt to the selective pressures they face in addition the selective pressure acting on hosts due to parasite and reinforced by parasite diversity within hosts seems to be a major evolutionary and ecological force shaping hosts biodiversity second we
the sera of 176 ms patients and of 150 healthy adult controls were assayed for antibodies against mumps rubella sendai and herpes simplex viruses a higher prevalence of measles c fa having already been demonstrated in the ms patients the csf of 48 of the ms patients were subjected to the same tests thepatients differed from the controls in a higherprevalence of h i a to mumps and of c f a to herpes simplex for the latter but not for the former the prevalence was statistically higher only in patients treated with immunosuppressants to date measles seems to be the most seriously incriminated virus in the etiopathogenesis of ms mumps ranking second
background torovirus infections have been associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea in horses cows pigs and humans especially in young animals and in children although asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases however toroviruses may pose a potential threat to worsen disease outcome in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens previous studies based on the analysis of limited numbers of samples indicated high seroprevalences against porcine torovirus ptov in various european countries the aim of this work was to perform a seroepidemiological survey of ptov in spanish farms in order to define the seroprevalence against this virus results serum samples n = 2664 from pigs of different ages were collected from 100 spanish farms coming from 10 regions that concentrate 96.1% of the 3392 farms with 80 or more sows censused in spain samples were screened by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay elisa based on a recombinant ptov nucleocapsid protein as antigen the analysis of the whole serum collection yielded a total of 95.7% 2550/2664 seropositive samples the highest prevalence 99.6% 1382/1388 and elisa values average o d ± standard deviation were observed in the sows 1.03±0.36 and the lowest prevalence 59.4% 98/165 and anti-ptov igg levels 0.45±0.16 were found amongst 3-week-old piglets both elisa reactivity values and seroprevalence percentages rose quickly with piglet's age from 3 to 11 weeks of age the seroprevalence was 99.3% 2254/2270 when only the samples from sows and pigs over 11-weeks of age were considered antibodies against ptov were detected in all analyzed farms conclusions this report describes the results of the largest torovirus seroepidemiological survey in farmed swine performed so far overall the seroprevalence against ptov in animals older than 11 weeks of age was >99% indicating that this virus is endemic in pig herds from spain
the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is one of the most important swine pathogens and often serves as an entry door for other viral or bacterial pathogens of which streptococcus suis is one of the most common pre-infection with prrsv leads to exacerbated disease caused by s suis infection very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdcs and monocytes in the context of prrsv and s suis co-infection was investigated bmdcs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to prrsv infection s suis phagocytosis by prrsv-infected bmdcs was found to be impaired whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival transcription profile analysis with a major focus on inflammatory genes following s suis infection with and without pre-infection with prrsv was then performed while prrsv pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to s suis infection a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in bmdcs pre-infected with prrsv after a subsequent infection with s suis while an additive effect could be observed for ccl4 ccl14 ccl20 and il-15 a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for il-6 ccl5 and tnf-α after co-infection this increased pro-inflammatory response by dcs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during prrsv and s suis co-infection
nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev are zoonotic henipaviruses hnvs responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness with fatality rates of 50-100%. no vaccines or licensed therapeutics currently exist to protect humans against niv or hev hnvs enter host cells by fusing the viral and cellular membranes via the concerted action of the attachment g and fusion f glycoproteins the main targets of the humoral immune response here we describe the isolation and humanization of a potent monoclonal antibody cross-neutralizing niv and hev cryo-electron microscopy triggering and fusion studies show the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope conserved in niv f and hev f glycoproteins and prevents membrane fusion and viral entry this work supports the importance of the hnv prefusion f conformation for eliciting a robust immune response and paves the way for using this antibody for prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy with niv-and hev-infected individuals
newcastle disease is considered the number one disease constraint to poultry production in low and middle-income countries however poultry that is raised in resource-poor areas often experience multiple environmental challenges heat stress has a negative impact on production and immune response to pathogens can be negatively modulated by heat stress candidate genes and regions chosen for this study were based on previously reported associations with response to immune stimulants pathogens or heat including tlr3 tlr7 mx mhc-b major histocompatibility complex gene complex ifi27l2 slc5a1 hspb1 hspa2 hspa8 ifrd1 il18r1 il1r1 ap2a2 and tollip chickens of a commercial egg-laying line were infected with a lentogenic strain of ndv newcastle disease virus half the birds were maintained at thermoneutral temperature and the other half were exposed to high ambient temperature before the ndv challenge and throughout the remainder of the study phenotypic responses to heat to ndv or to heat + ndv were measured selected snps single nucleotide polymorphisms within 14 target genes or regions were genotyped and genotype effects on phenotypic responses to ndv or heat + ndv were tested in each individual treatment group and the combined groups seventeen significant haplotype effects among seven genes and seven phenotypes were detected for response to ndv or heat or ndv + heat these findings identify specific genetic variants that are associated with response to heat and/or ndv which may be useful in the genetic improvement of chickens to perform favorably when faced with pathogens and heat stress
active immunization is an effective means of blocking the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs and holds promise as a treatment for heroin addiction previously we demonstrated the efficacy of our first-generation vaccine in blocking heroin self-administration in rats however many vaccine components can be modified to further improve performance herein we examine the effects of varying heroin vaccine injection route and adjuvant formulation mice immunized via subcutaneous sc injection exhibited inferior anti-heroin titers compared to intraperitoneal ip and sc/ip coadministration injection routes addition of tlr9 agonist cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 cpg odn 1826 to the original alum adjuvant elicited superior antibody titers and opioid affinities compared to alum alone to thoroughly assess vaccine efficacy full dose−response curves were generated for heroin-induced analgesia in both hot plate and tail immersion tests mice treated with cpg odn 1826 exhibited greatly shifted dose−response curves 10−13-fold vs unvaccinated controls while non-cpg odn vaccine groups did not exhibit the same robust effect 2−7fold shift for ip and combo 2−3-fold shift for sc our results suggest that cpg odn 1826 is a highly potent adjuvant and injection routes should be considered for development of small molecule−protein conjugate vaccines lastly this study has established a new standard for assessing drugs of abuse vaccines wherein a full dose−response curve should be performed in an appropriate behavioral task
several novel astroviruses have been recently discovered in humans and in other animals here we report results from our surveillance of astroviruses in human and rodent faecal samples in hong kong classical human astroviruses n59 and a human mlb1 astrovirus were detected in human faecal samples n5622 novel astroviruses were detected from 1.6 % of the faecal samples of urban brown rat rattus norvegicus n5441 indicating the prevalence of astrovirus infection in rats might be much lower than that recently observed in bats these rat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to recently discovered human astroviruses mlb1 and mlb2 suggesting that the mlb viruses and these novel rat astroviruses may share a common ancestor
ebola virus ebov is a significant human pathogen that presents a public health concern as an emerging/re-emerging virus and as a potential biological weapon substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against ebov among these prospects a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is particularly robust as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment a concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent vsv vectors that express ebov glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with hiv this is especially important as all ebov outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of central and western africa with high hiv incidence rates in the population in order to address this concern we evaluated the safety of the recombinant vsv vector expressing the zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein vsvdg/zebovgp in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus shiv all six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the vsvdg/ zebovgp vaccine suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations while one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy the vaccine protected 4 of 6 shiv-infected macaques from death following zebov challenge evaluation of cd4+ t cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal zebov challenge had the lowest cd4+ counts suggesting that cd4+ t cells may play a role in mediating protection against zebov
a dna vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus ibv can induce specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity however compared to conventional vaccines dna vaccines usually induce poor antibody responses to develop a more potent ibv dna vaccine formulations a monocistronic vector encoding the nucleocapsid protein of ibv and a bicistronic vector separately encoding the nucleocapsid protein and immunestimulatory interleukin-2 were constructed when the dna vaccines were administered to the quadriceps muscle of chickens the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated there was a significant difference in elisa antibody levels elicited by either monocistronic or bicistronic dna vaccines the percentage of cd3 + cd3 + cd8 + and cd3 + cd4 + subgroups of peripheral blood t-lymphocytes in chickens immunized with bicistronic dna vaccine were higher than those in chickens immunized with monocistronic dna vaccine when chickens were challenged with a virulent strain of ibv the protective efficacy could be enhanced significantly after immunization with bicistronic dna vaccine these results demonstrated that bicistronic dna vaccine is an effective approach to increase ibv dna vaccine immunogenicity
background vesiviruses family caliciviridae had been shown capable of invading a variety of host species raising concern of their zoonotic potential since the 1980's several canine caliciviruses cacv isolates have been reported and are phylogenetically related to the vesiviruses with features distinct from both vesicular exanthema of swine virus vesv and feline calicivirus fcv species in phylogeny serology and cell culture specificities etiological studies of canine diseases in dogs used for military services and laboratory studies were conducted in 1963-1978 at the walter reed army institute of research multiple known and unknown viral pathogens including caliciviruses were recovered methods four unidentified isolates were recovered in walter reed canine cells wrcc from respiratory fecal and penile specimens physicochemical tests electron microscopy viral cultivation in human and animal cells antibody neutralization assays and recently the genome sequencing were used to characterize the isolates sera from these dogs and their cohorts were tested with the isolates to determine origin and prevalence of the infections the viral isolates were small non-enveloped spherical rna virions 27 to 42 nm in diameter with cup-like structures indicating they are caliciviruses they propagated in wrcc and mdck cells not in either other canine cells or human and other animal cells each isolate is antigenically distinct and react with dog sera in respective cohorts the genomes have nucleotide identities ranging from 70.3% to 90.7% and encode the non-structural polyprotein 1810 amino acids major capsid protein 691 amino acids and minor structural protein 134 amino acids they belong to two different phylogenetic clades in vesivirus genus with close relation with canine calicivirus cacv conclusions these cacv isolates have restricted cell tropism antigenic diversity and genetic variation further investigation will shed light on antigenic relation to other vesiviruses and its pathogenicity for dogs and potential infectivity to other animals together with the previously reported cacv strains provides significant evidence to support the formation of a new cacv species in the vesivirus genus
the recent dramatic increase in reported cases of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped in pig farms is a potential threat to the global swine industry therefore the accurate diagnosis serological monitoring and surveillance of specific antibodies in pigs resulting from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection or vaccination would be essential in helping to control the spread of ped we developed and validated an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the recombinant membrane m protein of pedv to detect pedv antibodies in eight herds 382 serum samples were collected from sows that had been immunized with a ped vaccine and screened using the developed elisa in parallel with a serum neutralization sn assay of the tested samples 276 were positive for the presence of pedv antibodies according to both assays while 98 were negative an excellent agreement between the elisa and the sn assay was observed kappa = 0.947 95% confidence interval = 0.910-0.984 mcnemar's test p = 0.727 no cross-reaction was detected for the developed elisa with other coronaviruses or other common pig pathogens the developed elisa could be used for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of ped infection
most of studies have focused on molecular and pathogenic characterization of pedv whereas there were limited studies in understanding the role of gut microbiota gm in viral-associated diarrhea here using the illumina miseq platform we examined and compared the impact of pedv infection on the gm of sows and their piglets less than 10 days old our results showed that pedv caused alternations in the structure and abundance of gm from levels of phylum to genus and even species for sows a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows p < 0.05 the unweighted and weighted unifrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of gm structure among healthy asymptomatic and diarrheal sows for piglets bacteroidetes the dominant bacteria in healthy piglets were replaced by firmicutes in asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets the abundances of fusobacteria and proteobacteria were also remarkably increased in asymptomatic piglets and diarrheal piglets when compared to those of the healthy piglets our findings demonstrated that pedv infection caused severe perturbations of gm reduced probiotic bacteria and enriched pathogenic bacteria since 2010 the global swine industry has experienced outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 1-3 . the variant pedv caused severe diarrhea vomiting dehydration and high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets as well as sporadic diarrhea in sows and finishing pigs in china in 2010 afterwards the outbreaks have been reported in europe 4 america 56 and other asian countries 78 . pigs suffered from diarrheal syndromes were unresponsive to antibiotics treatment and common management practices and were even not protected from prior immunization with attenuated and/or inactivated cv777-based pedv vaccines 910 .most of previous studies were mainly focused on the characterization of pedv virus isolation pathology and molecular evolution however there were only limited studies about the effects of the mucosal microflora residents on health and their roles during pedv infection the mammalian gut is a complex ecological niche containing bacteria eukaryotes viruses and even archaeon 11 . it has been demonstrated that colonized gut microbiota gm are important for the health and development of animals via aiding colonic fermentation 12 stimulating the immune system 13 defensing pathogens 14 and improving energy harvest 15 . studies on humans unraveled that diarrhea 16 and bowel inflammation 17 would distort gm in normal gut in pigs a few studies that examined the gm of healthy pigs under different growth stages or breeds demonstrated bacteroidetes and firmicutes are predominant phyla regardless of ages and breeds while dynamic changes in percentage of gm at both phylum and genus levels were observed under different growth stages and conditions including age weaning and colitis . remarkable alternations of fecal microbiota were reported in neonatal piglets with diarrhea nnpd of unknown etiology 26 27 . it was reported genus enterococcus was 24 times and phylum fusobacteria was doubled in abundance in diarrheal piglets compared to that of the healthy piglets studies on diarrheal weaning pigs and newborn piglets with natural infection of pedv
neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a number of european countries the aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed the viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids rna and dna fractions were subjected to sequence independent amplification samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually in total 29 clinical samples plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the ion torrent platform the resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using kraken diamond and hmmer in the healthy specimens eight different mammalian virus families were detected adenoviridae anelloviridae astroviridae caliciviridae circoviridae parvoviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples anelloviridae circoviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae it was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea in conclusion this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses the results do however indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection
mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis m paratuberculosis causes johne's disease in ruminants and is characterized by chronic gastroenteritis leading to heavy economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide the currently available vaccine inactivated bacterin in oil base is not effective in preventing pathogen shedding and is rarely used to control johne's disease in dairy herds to develop a better vaccine that can prevent the spread of johne's disease we utilized polyanhydride nanoparticles pan to encapsulate mycobacterial antigens composed of whole cell lysate pan-lysate and culture filtrate pan-cf of m paratuberculosis these nanoparticle-based vaccines i e nanovaccines were well tolerated in mice causing no inflammatory lesions at the site of injection immunological assays demonstrated a substantial increase in the levels of antigen-specific t cell responses post-vaccination in the pan-cf vaccinated group as indicated by high percentages of triple cytokine ifn-γ il-2 tnf-α producing cd8 + t cells following challenge animals vaccinated with pan-cf continued to produce significant levels of double ifn-γ tnf-α and single cytokine ifn-γ secreting cd8 + t cells compared with animals vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine a significant reduction in bacterial load was observed in multiple organs of animals vaccinated with pan-cf which is a clear indication of protection overall the use of polyanhydride nanovaccines resulted in development of protective and sustained immunity against johne's disease an approach that could be applied to counter other intracellular pathogens npj vaccines 2020 515 https//doi
mammalian orthoreoviruses mrvs have a wide range of geographic distribution and have been isolated from humans and various animals this study describes the isolation molecular characterization and analysis of pathogenicity of mrv variant b/03 from wild short-nosed fruit bats negative stain electron microscopy illustrated that the b/03 strain is a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a diameter of 70 nm sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page migration patterns showed that the b/03 viral genome contains 10 segments in a 334 arrangement the isolate belongs to mrv serotype 1 based on s1 gene nucleotide sequence data balb/c mice experimentally infected with b/03 virus by intranasal inoculation developed severe respiratory distress with tissue damage and inflammation lastly b/03 virus has an increased transmission risk between bats and humans or animals
bats constitute a reservoir of zoonotic infections and some bat paramyxoviruses are capable of cross-species transmission often with fatal consequences determining the level of viral diversity in reservoir populations is fundamental to understanding and predicting viral emergence this is particularly relevant for rna viruses where the adaptive mutations required for cross-species transmission can be present in the reservoir host we report the use of non-invasively collected pooled neat urine samples as a robust sample type for investigating paramyxoviruses in bat populations using consensus pcr assays we have detected a high incidence and genetic diversity of novel paramyxoviruses in an urban fruit bat population over a short period of time this may suggest a similarly unique relationship between bats and the members of the family paramyxoviridae as proposed for some other viral families additionally the high rate of bathuman contact at the study site calls for the zoonotic potential of the detected viruses to be investigated further
most human emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife and bats are a major reservoir of viruses a few of which have been highly pathogenic to humans in some regions of cameroon bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy this close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events to elucidate the viral diversity of cameroonian fruit bats we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of eidolon helvum and epomophorus gambianus fruit bats the results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus h genome showed clearly separated clusters of human porcine and bat rotavirus h strains not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events additionally we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome a novel group of recently described viruses related to astroviruses and hepatitis e viruses confirming their recombinant nature and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses interestingly picobirnavirus-like rna-dependent rna polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi although identified bat coronavirus parvovirus and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families finally the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems
the original scientifi c strategy behind vaccinology has historically been to "isolate inactivate and inject" fi rst invoked by louis pasteur the recombinant dna and nanotechnology did much enlarge the repertoire on vaccines which is today based on three adjusted principles attenuation inactivation and recombination as shown in fig 9 .1 . the three principles are regarded as equal and all experimental possibilities for a new vaccine development against a pathogen should be studied in detail the recombinant dna and nanotechnology did not change the basic scientifi c strategy live and non-live vaccines live vaccines are non-adjuvanted and non-live vaccines are generally adjuvanted new developments against tuberculosis tb highlight this broad experimental approachtoday it estimated that about one-third of the world population is infected with the tb bacillus approximately 54 million people are infected every year 9.4 million develop the disease and 1.7 million die from this curable disease the tb bacillus kills more people than any other infectious agent alone currently bcg bacillus calmette-guérin is the only vaccine recommended by the who with more than three billion doses administered since its introduction in 1921 bcg is prepared from a strain of the attenuated live bovine tuberculosis bacillus mycobacterium bovis which lost its virulence in humans by being specially subcultured in an artifi cial medium however although it protects newborns and children from severe forms of tb its effi cacy against pulmonary tb in adolescents and adults is far from optimal with protection rates varying between 0 and 80 % according to the geographical area contentslive and non-live vaccines
viruses that cause uris include rhinovirus rv adenovirus influenza virus flu parainfluenza virus coxsackie virus and rsv comparative studies of experimental infection of adult humans with rsv flu rv and coxsackie a virus show that all of these viruses provoke a similar local symptom-sign presentation with varying degrees of systemic involvement nasal secretory response pattern of complications with varying frequencies and a panel of elaborated inflammatory mediators ims leukotrienes and cytokines . differences that exist among viruses primarily reflect the types of cells that are infected tissue tropism and thus the degree to which the infection is localized for example although rvs are generally confined to the upper airways by their sensitivity to temperature rsv can be disseminated to the lung and middle ear by way of the contiguous mucosa and flu can infect leukocytes via viremic dissemination these observations suggest that the pathogenesis of the local cold-like signs symptoms and complications is common to the different etiologic agents and most likely represents the consequences of a generalized host response to viral infection of the nasal mucosa the most prominent signs and symptoms of vuris include rhinorrhea sneezing nasal obstruction sore throat cough malaise fever and sweats . in some studies the development of airway hyperreactivity has been reported and complications involving the paranasal sinuses are common . also reported are otologic complications including eustachian tube obstruction middle ear underpressures and otitis media although cold-like illness or symptoms are not always associated with viral detection by pcr during om . most studies have failed to culture virus from the site of the complication sinus lung or middle ear and the development of complications has been associated with the extension of the inflammatory response as opposed to in situ viral infection the pathogenesis of symptoms and signs of illness and the pathophysiologies and complications of vuris have been studied using epidemiological surveys animal models and adults experimentally infected with different respiratory viruses importantly similar patterns and magnitudes of pathophysiologic and symptomatic responses to infection were documented for experimental and natural vuris . a distinct advantage offered by the experimental model over natural infection is its high degree of control over several factors the health of the subjects the dose and nature of the infecting agent and the precise temporal sequence of infection signs and symptoms and elaboration of ims and cytokines early studies of the host response to vuris focused on the humoral system high homotypic serum neutralizing igg antibody titers have been associated with
the objective of this study was to assess if lipoteichoic acid lta produced by staphylococcus aureus exacerbates respiratory disease in porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv-infected pigs as has previously been shown with lipopolysaccharide piglets were inoculated with prcv and 24 h later with s aureus lta clinical signs lung virus titres inflammatory cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf were compared with those of animals in prcv-and ltainoculated control groups all prcv-lta inoculated pigs except one developed severe respiratory disease whereas clinical signs in the control groups were minimal or absent virus titres and grossly visible pulmonary lesions were similar in the prcv-lta-and prcv-inoculated groups and were not detected in the lta-group neutrophil percentages in balf were higher in the prcv-lta than in the prcv group there was no significant difference in interferon ifn-γ interleukin il-1 il-6 il-12/ il-23 and tumour necrosis factor tnf-α concentrations in balf between the prcv-lta and prcv groups but levels of il-6 il-12/il-23 and ifn-γ were higher in the prcv-ltainoculated than in the lta-inoculated controls the findings suggest that the experimentally-induced respiratory disease was not mediated by cytokine over-production but rather reflected the concerted action of particular cytokine interactions and/or as yet unidentified mediators this is the first in vivo study to report the synergistic interaction between a virus and lta in enhancing the severity of respiratory disease in the pig given that gram-positive bacteria capable of producing lta are commonly found in pig accommodation the role of this compound in the development of the porcine respiratory disease complex requires further investigation
mucosal surfaces are common sites of pathogen colonization/entry effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response a new strain of enterococcus faecium a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria lab with strong cell adhesion ability was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens specifically sigma c protein of avian reovirus arv a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus 1 protein and responsible for m-cell targeting was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus ibv next the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the lab strain intranasal in immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic ig immunization in immunization produced antigen specific iga both systemically and in the lungs a higher iga titer was induced by the lab with arv c protein attached moreover the serum of mice immunized with lab displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against arv c protein compared to ibv-s1 our results indicate that arv c protein delivered by lab via the in route elicits strong mucosal immunity a needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration especially for respiratory infections in economic animals furthermore arv c a strong immunogen of arv may be able to serve as an immunoenhancer for other vaccines especially avian vaccines
significance and impact of the study the noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_ncov the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in traditional chinese medicine since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses a change in these practices is highly recommended the current outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus 2019_ncov now named sars-cov-2 illustrated difficulties in identifying a novel coronavirus and its natural host as the coding sequences of various betacoronavirus species can be highly diverse by means of wholegenome sequence comparisons we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies the conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could in theory classify novel virus species into their subspecies only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus furthermore it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in china and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes a number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species these bats are used in traditional chinese medicine and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics.342
xenotransplantation is a possible solution for the shortage of tissues for human transplantation multiple hurdles exist to clinical xenotransplantation including immunologic barriers metabolic differences between pigs -the source species most commonly considered -and humans and ethical concerns since clinical trials were first proposed almost 10 years ago the degree of risk for infection transmitted from the xenograft donor to the recipient has been extensively investigated a number of potential viral pathogens have been identified including porcine endogenous retrovirus perv porcine cytomegalovirus pcmv and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus plhv sensitive diagnostic assays have been developed for each virus human-tropic perv are exogenous recombinants between perv-a and perv-c sequences and are present in only a subset of swine porcine cytomegalovirus can be excluded from herds of source animals by early weaning of piglets in contrast the risks associated with plhv remain undefined microbiologic studies and assays for potential xenogeneic pathogens have furthered understanding of risks associated with xenotransplantation thus far clinical xenotransplantation of pig tissues has not resulted in transmission of viral infection to humans significant risks for disease transmission from swine to humans have not been confirmed if immunologic hurdles can be overcome it is reasonable to initiate carefully monitored clinical trials
infections by clostridium perfringens type a are perhaps the most common causes of clostridial hemorrhagic enteritis in neonatal ruminants affected calves exhibit tympany hemorrhagic abomasitis and abomasal ulceration gram-positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood but probably include dietary issues perhaps relating to overfeeding feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum or conditions which effect decreased gut motility fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome the calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea and the abdomen became distended and painful in spite of intensive therapy the calf died 48 h after birth at necropsy the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic the proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous and microscopic examination revealed gram-positive rods in association with acute necrotizing hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation isolates of c perfringens from this calf were pcr positive for cpb2 the gene encoding beta2 toxin this finding is of unknown significance only 14.3% 8/56 of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive and only 50% of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express cpb2 the most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease elucidation of virulence attributes and development and application of prevention and control strategies r

one of the great challenges in the ecology of infectious diseases is to understand what drives the emergence of new pathogens including the relationship between viruses and their hosts in the case of the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of sars-cov infection in apparently healthy bats suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease to elucidate the biogeographic origin of sars-cov and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences to this end rdrp sequence of coronavirinae was targeted by rt-pcr in non-invasive samples from bats collected in thailand two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species one betacoronavirus in hipposideros larvatus and one alphacoronavirus in hipposideros armiger interestingly these viruses from south-east asia are related to those previously detected in africa betacoronavirus-b or in europe alphacoronavirus & betacoronavirus-b these findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the sars-cov group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a betacoronavirus spill-over from hipposideridae to rhinolophidae and then from rhinolophidae to civets and human all reported betacoronaviruses-b sars-cov group of hipposideridae and rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families moreover despite its probable pathogenicity we found that a betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony these findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence the host's phylogeny biogeography and behaviour combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence elucidating the common ancestor of hipposideridae and rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of sars-cov
background and aim venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev is an alphavirus that causes encephalitis with a high impact on public health in latin america however only in guatemala trinidad and tobago and mexico have found antibodies in veev in bats using immunohistochemistry the sensitivity and specificity are improved thus it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts this study aimed to determine the presence of veev in tissues of frugivorous bats a prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of córdoba and sucre area of the colombian caribbean two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified according to the ethics committee of the university of córdoba the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid n2 at −196°c a portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the veev of the 286 bats captured 23 species were identified in samples of the brain spleen and lung of two frugivorous bats 2/286=0.70% artibeus planirostris and sturnira lilium the presence of veev was confirmed by immunohistochemistry a fragment of the nsp4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified two samples were positive 2/286=0.70% in frugivorous bats a planirostris code genbank mg820274 and s lilium code genbank mg820275 the present study showed the first molecular evidence and cellular evidence histopathology and immunohistochemistry of natural veev infection in frugivorous bats in colombia these bats could be a host of this zoonosis
cowpox virus infections in captive cheetahs acinonyx jubatus with high morbidity and mortality have already been reported in the uk and russia in the 1970s however most of the reported cases have been singular events here we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in denmark between 2010 and 2014 nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease two of them died 22%. all episodes occurred between august and october of the respective year no other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected the clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus high anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact additionally whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses however the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event these findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus probably from wild rodent populations where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs sero-positivity of voles arvicola amphibious caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis as a consequence recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds
non-primate hepacivirus nphv has been identified in dogs horses bats and wild rodents the presence of nphv in dogs outside of the usa however is yet to be established here we describe for the first time the detection of nphv in the uk dog population described throughout the manuscript as cnnphv we examined tissues collected from dogs housed in a rehoming kennel where respiratory disease was endemic cnnphv rna was detected in the tracheal tissues of 48/210 dogs by rt-pcr and in the liver lung and/or tracheal tissues of 12/ 20 dogs the presence of cnnphv rna and its tropism was confirmed by in situ hybridisation histopathological examination demonstrated a trend toward higher histopathological scores in cnnphv rna positive respiratory tissues although this was not statistically significant our findings broaden the geographic distribution and our understanding of cnnphv further evidence of cnnphv replication in canids warrants investigation
background ebola viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates and are endemic in africa reston ebolavirus rebov has caused several epizootics in cynomolgus monkeys macaca fascicularis but is not associated with any human disease in late 2008 rebov infections were identified in swine for the first time in the philippines methods a total of 215 swine sera collected at two rebov-affected farms in 2008 in pangasinan and bulacan were tested for the presence of rebov-specific antibodies using multiple serodiagnosis systems a total of 98 swine sera collected in a non-epizootic region tarlac were also tested to clarify the prevalence of rebov infection in the general swine population in the philippines results some 70 % of swine sera at the affected farms were positive for rebov antibodies in the multiple serodiagnosis systems on the other hand none of the swine sera collected in tarlac showed positive reactions in any of the diagnosis systems the high prevalence of rebov infection in swine in the affected farms in 2008 suggests that swine is susceptible for rebov infection the multiple serological assays used in the study are thought to be useful for future surveillance of reobv infection in swine in the philippines
gastroenteritis of viral origin has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs during the last two decades amongst the viral etiologies responsible for gastroenteritis in dogs canine parvovirus cpv is considered as the most pathogenic the disease is characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis bloody diarrhoea and myocarditis in young pups the present study was carried out to examine alterations in oxidative stress indices in the erythrocytes from dogs suffering from gastroenteritis with or without canine parvoviral infection as confirmed by cpv-dna amplification from faeces using specific primers for cpv-2 as well as cpv-2a and cpv-2b variants by polymerase chain reaction pcr the present investigation utilized clinical cases of dogs with signs of acute diarrhea n = 56 and 14 more apparently healthy dogs of similar age group erythrocytic oxidative stress indices such as lipid peroxides level and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase activity and blood micro-mineral iron copper cobalt and zinc status were analyzed in each dog n = 70 the acute cases of gastroenteritis in dogs were associated with altered erythrocytic lipid peroxidation as evident by estimation of malonaldehyde mda concentration the activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase the first line of antioxidant defense against damaging effects of free radicals were also altered the alterations in oxidative stress indices were more pronounced in cases with involvement of canine parvovirus as compared to parvo-negative cases our results also revealed decreased blood zinc level in diarrhoea in dogs irrespective of involvement of canine parvovirus
the conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide this issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout north america so called 'colony collapse disorder' yet we still have little understanding of the causes of bee declines wild bumble bees bombus spp have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops is a possible cause we constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and using laboratory experiments and the literature estimated parameter values for the spillover of crithidia bombi a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial bombus we also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover and compared the fit of our model to patterns of c bombi infection observed in the field our model predicts that during the first three months of spillover transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse however a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly infecting up to 35-100% of wild bombus and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk in the field although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection the prevalences of c bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model indeed we found that spillover has allowed c bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses given the available evidence it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild bombus in north america improved management of domestic bees for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover
bovine group a rotavirus rva is considered the major cause of diarrhea in intensively reared neonatal calves chicken egg yolk antibodies igy are efficient in protecting neonatal calves from rva diarrhea however the value of this intervention in calves once diarrhea has appeared is unclear the aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of rva-specific igy as a passive treatment in those cases the experimental groups were g1 = rva-specific igy treatment g2 = no ab treatment and g3 = colostrum deprived + no ab treatment igy treatment significantly reduced virus shedding diarrhea duration and severity compared to g2 and g3 calves however it caused a partial suppression of systemic ab responses to rva that could be associated with less severe diarrhea the oral treatment with igy for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with other groups of animals
viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses they can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds this study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the australian wildlife health centre at zoos victoria's healesville sanctuary for veterinary care between december 2014 and december 2015 samples were tested for avian influenza viruses herpesviruses paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses using genus-or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses a very low prevalence of viruses was detected columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl ninox strenua with inclusion body hepatitis and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet glossopsitta concinna two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphurcrested cockatoo cacatua galerita and a tawny frogmouth podargus strigoides avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected the clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined further studies are needed to assess the host specificity epidemiology pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses further genome characterization is also indicated and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically the detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity the low level of avian virus detection and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health
22901 a comparison of subcutaneous nasal and combined influenza vaccination ii protection against natural challenge amer j epidem 93 480-486 1971.-monovalent killed influenza ai hong kong vaccine in doses 400 cca units recommended for dvilian use was given to insurance company employees and elderly psychiatric patients by injection nasal spray or a combination of both methods vacdnees and controls were then studied for evidence of immunity to influenza during the 1968-1969 epidemic parenteral vaccination was well tolerated and effective in reducing influenza infection and illness rates in both groups vaccine had no effect on total respiratory illness in the insurance group although total absenteeism was lowered because of the greater effect of influenza over that of colds in causing time lost from work vaccine given by spray into the respiratory tract was ineffective the addition of spray to parenteral vaccination provided no additional advantage over parenteral vaccination alone
the recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a sars-like illness in the middle-east a decade after the sars pandemic demonstrates that reemergence of a sars-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat because sars is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics to this aim we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine mv candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored sars-cov spike s protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain ssol in mice susceptible to measles virus recombinant mv expressing the anchored full-length s induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with sars-cov as compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant ssol protein recombinant mv induced stronger and th1-biased responses a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine
the efficacy of a novel bei-inactivated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv candidate vaccine in pigs developed at ribsp republic of kazakhstan and delivered with an adjuvant montanide tm gel 01 st d/kv/adj was compared with a commercial killed prrsv vaccine nvdc-jxa1 c/kv/adj used widely in swine herds of the republic of kazakhstan clinical parameters body temperature and respiratory disease scores virological and immunological profiles macroscopic lung lesions and viral load in the lungs quantitative realtime pcr and cell culture assay were assessed in vaccinated and both genotype 1 and 2 prrsv challenged pigs our results showed that the commercial vaccine failed to protect pigs adequately against the clinical disease viremia and lung lesions caused by the challenged field isolates kazakh strains of prrsv type 1 and type 2 genotypes in contrast clinical protection absence of viremia and lung lesions in d/kv/adj vaccinated pigs was associated with generation of vn antibodies in both homologous vaccine strain lkz/ 2010 prrsv type 2 and a heterogeneous type 1 prrsv strain cm/08 challenged pigs thus our data indicated the induction of cross-protective vn antibodies by d/kv/adj vaccine and importantly demonstrated that an inactivated prrsv vaccine could also induce cross-protective response across the viral genotype
an average of 70 samples were collected from 80 dairy farms in england and wales from cattle co-grazed sheep wildlife and farm wastes to investigate prevalence potential sources and transmission routes of cryptosporidium at least one positive sample was detected on 74 of the farms 92.5% by ifat microscopy the prevalence in cattle was 10.2% 95% ci 9.4-11.1% with greater prevalences detected in calf samples especially from those under 1 month 45.1%. young calves were also more likely to be shedding cryptosporidium parvum and larger concentrations of oocysts whereas older calves and adult cattle were more likely to be shedding cryptosporidium bovis and cryptosporidium andersoni respectively the c parvum subtypes detected were predominantly from types commonly identified in uk cattle 67% were either iiaa15g2r1 or iiaa17g1r1 a novel subtype iiaa17g1r2 was identified from one cattle sample the prevalence in co-grazed sheep was low 4%. birds and rodents may represent significant reservoirs of cryptosporidium due to high prevalence large oocyst concentrations and the detection of a c parvum subtype known to be present in human populations identified in samples from these wildlife cryptosporidium were detected in dirty water and manure and also from pasture samples where slurry had been spread on 64% of the farms identical cryptosporidium species were detected mainly c parvum or c bovis from different cattle groups on the farms although no direct or indirect contact between the groups were recorded apart from sharing staff the same cryptosporidium species were found in cattle farm wastes and bird samples on the same farms but rarely or not at all present in sheep or rodent samples the matching of species/subtypes was also related to the proximity of the different sample sources which may indicate a potential transmission route crown
background concurrent infection with porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is known as one of the major causes for porcine respiratory disease complex prdc dual infection with pcv2 and prrsv is consistently to have more severe clinical presentations and pulmonary lesions than infection with pcv2 alone or prrsv alone however it is not known if dual infections with pcv2 and prrsv in different infection order may lead to different clinical symptoms in the host to mimic the possible field conditions swine alveolar macrophages ams were inoculated with pcv2 and prrsv in vitro simultaneously or with one virus 18 h earlier than the other the cell viability cytopathic effects antigen-containing rates phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities cytokine profiles il-8 tnf-α and ifn-α and fasl transcripts were determined analyzed and compared to prove the hypothesis results a marked reduction in prrsv antigen-containing rate cytopathic effect and tnf-α expression level was revealed in ams inoculated with pcv2 and prrsv simultaneously and in ams inoculated with pcv2 first then prrsv 18 h later but not in ams inoculated with prrsv first then pcv2 18 h later transient decrease in phagocytosis but constant reduction in microbicidal capability in ams in the group inoculated with pcv2 alone and constant decrease in phagocytosis and microbicidal capability in ams in all prrsv-inoculated groups were noted the levels of il-8 tnf-α ifn-α and fasl transcripts in ams in all groups with dual inoculation of pcv2 and prrsv were significantly increased regardless of the infection orders as compared with infection by pcv2 alone or prrsv alone conclusions swine ams infected with pcv2 first then prrsv later or infected with pcv2 and prrsv simultaneously displayed marked reduction in prrsv antigen-containing rate cytopathic effect and tnf-α expression level the different inoculation orders of pcv2 and prrsv in ams leading to different results in viral antigen positivity cytopathology and cytokine profile may explain at least partially the underlying mechanism of the enhanced pulmonary lesions in prdc exerted by dual infection with pcv2 and prrsv and the variable clinical manifestations of prdc-affected pigs in the field

borna disease is a severe immunopathological disorder of the central nervous system caused by the infection with the borna disease virus bdv the detection of bdv in diseased animals mainly sheep and horses is achieved by histological immunohistochemical and serological approaches and/or pcr-based technologies in the present study reverse transcription real-time pcr assays were established for the detection of bdv in the brain tissue from sheep and horses using loci for the p40 nucleoprotein and the p24 phosphoprotein genes the pcrs were equally specific and sensitive detecting 10 target molecules per reaction and one bdv-infected cell among 10 6 non-infected cells in tissues from bdv-diseased sheep and horses the p24 target was detected at higher abundance than for p40 therefore the p24 test is suggested to be of higher value in the diagnostic laboratory however both assays should be useful for addressing questions in pathogenesis and for detecting bdv reservoirs in endemic areas r
current vaccines that provide protection against infectious diseases have primarily relied on attenuated or inactivated pathogens virus-like particles vlps comprised of capsid proteins that can initiate an immune response but do not include the genetic material required for replication promote immunogenicity and have been developed and approved as vaccines in some cases in addition many of these vlps can be used as molecular platforms for genetic fusion or chemical attachment of heterologous antigenic epitopes this approach has been shown to provide protective immunity against the foreign epitopes in many cases a variety of vlps and virus-based nanoparticles are being developed for use as vaccines and epitope platforms these particles have the potential to increase efficacy of current vaccines as well as treat diseases for which no effective vaccines are available
prrsv live vaccines are widely used in pig farming practice and are usually not adjuvanted for safety issues it would be useful to reduce the antigenic load of such vaccines while preserving their efficacy in this study we show that the addition of polymer or oil adjuvants in a prrs live vaccine enhanced the protection to challenge of vaccinated animals compared to a non-adjuvanted commercial reference moreover for both types of adjuvants despite lower antibody titers the protection to challenge given by the adjuvanted vaccine containing only 50% of the antigen load was equivalent to the protection given by the non-adjuvanted vaccine these results demonstrate that the addition of relevant adjuvants can enhance the efficacy of the protection conferred to animals by live vaccines

we discovered a lethal hemorrhagic syndrome arising from severe thrombocytopenia in japanese macaques kept at the primate research institute kyoto university extensive investigation identified that simian retrovirus type 4 srv-4 was the causative agent of the disease srv-4 had previously been isolated only from cynomolgus macaques in which it is usually asymptomatic we consider that the srv-4 crossed the so-called species barrier between cynomolgus and japanese macaques leading to extremely severe acute symptoms in the latter infectious agents that cross the species barrier occasionally amplify in virulence which is not observed in the original hosts in such cases the new hosts are usually distantly related to the original hosts however japanese macaques are closely related to cynomolgus macaques and can even hybridize when given the opportunity this lethal outbreak of a novel pathogen in japanese macaques highlights the need to modify our expectations about virulence with regards crossing species barriers
background outbreaks of avian influenza ai caused by infection with low pathogenic h9n2 viruses have occurred in poultry resulting in serious economic losses in asia and the middle east it has been difficult to eradicate the h9n2 virus because of its low pathogenicity frequently causing in apparent infection it is important for the control of ai to assess whether the h9n2 virus acquires pathogenicity as h5 and h7 viruses in the present study we investigated whether a non-pathogenic h9n2 virus a/chicken/yokohama/aq-55/2001 y55 h9n2 acquires pathogenicity in chickens when a pair of di-basic amino acid residues is introduced at the cleavage site of its ha molecule
an understanding of the nature of immune protection and the role of immune effector products such as interferon-g ifn-g in the control of infectious disease is fundamental to the rational design of effective vaccines and immunotherapeutic reagents murine monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies mabs and pabs to feline ifn-g fifn-g were generated firstly to facilitate further research into the role of cellular immune responses in the control of feline infectious disease and secondly to enable evaluation of the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches a hybridoma clone d9 secreting igg1 antibodies was selected for expansion and the mabs affinity purified in vitro polyclonal antibodies were raised in a sheep against recombinant fifn-g and affinity purified the sensitivity of the d9 mab and the sheep anti-fifn-g pab was determined using an indirect fifn-g enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and immunoblots these antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fifn-g by specific feline t cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus felv antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin a bfa production of fifn-g was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect pe-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc-labelled intracellular fifn-g using this approach our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fifn-g-secreting cd4 + t cells in the lymph nodes of felv latently infected cats d
immunological detection of viruses and their components by monoclonal antibodies is a powerful method for studying the structure and function of viral molecules here we describe detailed methods for establishing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov b cell hybridomas are generated from mice that are hyperimmunized with inactivated sars-cov virions the hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies that recognize viral component molecules including the spike protein s and the nucleocapsid protein n enabling the immunological detection of sars-cov by immunofluorescence staining immunoblot or an antigen-capture elisa system in addition several s protein-specific antibodies are shown to have in vitro neutralization activity thus the monoclonal antibody approach provides useful tools for rapid and specific diagnosis of sars as well as for possible antibody-based treatment of the disease
transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev is one of the most severe threats to the swine industry in this study we constructed a suite of recombinant lactobacillus plantarum with surface displaying the spike s protein coming from tgev and fused with dc cells targeting peptides dcpep to develop an effective safe and convenient vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis our research results found that the recombinant lactobacillus plantarum nc8-psip409-pgsa-s-dcpep group expressing s fused with dcpep could not only significantly increase the percentages of mhc-ii + cd80 + b cells and cd3 + cd4 + t cells but also the number of iga + b cells and cd3 + cd4 + t cells of ileum lamina propria which elevated the specific secretory immunoglobulin a siga titers in feces and igg titers in serum taken together these results suggest that nc8-psip409-pgsa-s-dcpep expressing the s of tgev fused with dcpep could effectively induce immune responses and provide a feasible original strategy and approach for the design of tgev vaccines
pohjola s oksanen h neuvonen e veijalainen p and henriksson k 1986 certain enteropathogens in calves of finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of diarrhea prey vet med 3 547--558 the occurrence and distribution of certain enteropathogenic organisms and the manifestation of diarrhea especially in relation to colostral management were studied in neonatal calves of eight southern finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of enteric disturbances the fecal samples were obtained from the calves and were provided by the farmers potentially pathogenic agents were demonstrated in 52 of the 68 calves studied cryptosporidium was found in 36 of them while rotavirus was found in 29 and escherichin coli in 15 of them either singly or in combination salmonella coronavirus or parvovirus were not detected in any of the calves twenty-six of the 36 calves contracted their cryptosporidium infection and 18 of the 29 calves their rotavirus infection within the first week of life eighteen of the 52 infected calves developed diarrhea of microbial origin within 20 days of age the most frequent finding was mixed infection with cryptosporidium and rotavirus in addition there were six diarrheic calves where no infection could be demonstrated only 10 of the 68 calves had neither infections nor diarrhea there was a highly significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the uninfected non-diarrheic and diarrheic calves and a significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the subclinically infected and diarrheic calves the importance of sucking of colostrum at the first feeding was observed the smallest amount protecting the calves from infections was 0.75 1 given within 1 h of delivery
background poultry bacterial pathogens are mainly controlled by using high-cost sanitary measures and medical treatment however the drug-resistant strains of pathogens continuously emerge and medical treatments are often ineffective moreover there is increasing public objections to drug residues in poultry products the other important type of control is the vaccination which depends on immunity this immunological control is the major practical alternative to chemotherapy success of vaccines in combating poultry diseases depends mainly on the choice of the proper type of vaccines correct time of its usage and method of administration the types of vaccines include attenuated live vaccines and these vaccines were shown to be effective in inducing protection the second type is killed vaccine or whole bacteria extracts which is less successful in providing protection compared to live vaccines the metabolic product vaccine toxoids is the third type of vaccine the recombinant dna technique was adopted to produce the protective antigens in a sufficient amount and in costeffective ways conclusions protection studies against bacterial diseases were performed by using several trials living vaccines live attenuated vaccines live non-pathogenic microorganisms live low virulence microorganism inactivated killed vaccines heat-inactivated chemical inactivates radiation metabolic product vaccines toxoids subunit vaccines whole cell proteins outer membrane proteins purified flagellar proteins flagellin fimbrial proteins pilus proteins lipopolysaccharides vaccines produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid dna technology and dna vaccines
current influenza vaccines provide hemagglutinin strain-specific protection but rarely provide cross-protection against divergent strains it is therefore particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus in this study we used n-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus m2 protein m2e as the target antigen and constructed two optimized m2e dna vaccines p-tpa-p3m2e and p-p3m2e with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion both vaccines induced high m2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice these two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic h1n1 virus with p-tpa-p3m2e being the most effective in addition p-tpa-p3m2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus h9n2 h6n6 and h10n8 at varying rates 80% 40% and 20% respectively after passive immunization m2e dna vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge an analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that m2e-specific igg and t-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance taken together our results indicate that this optimized m2e dna vaccine is a promising candidate for the development of a universal broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine
six monoclonal antibodies raised against feline calicivirus fcv strain f9 were used in an enzyme-linked immuno-flow-assay elifa to analyse 55 isolates of fcv forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease chronic oral lesions and from cats showing vaccine reactions i e clinical signs of fcv infection shortly after vaccination eight reference strains including f9 and three vaccine strains based on f9 were also examined all of the strains of f9 derived from various sources reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any in general the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished however there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups overall the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals suggesting they were less related to f9 although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to f9 none of the isolates tested reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies
recently we have realized that viruses numerically dominate all life although viruses are known to affect host survival in populations this has not been previously evaluated in the context of host group selection group selection per se is not a currently accepted idea and its apparent occurrence is explained by statistical gene frequency models of kin selection viruses were not considered in such models prevalent views associate viruses and disease yet many viruses establish species-specific persistent inapparent infections that are stable on an evolutionary time scale such persistent infections can have large effects on relative reproductive fitness of competing host populations in this essay i present arguments on how persistent infections can promote population survival mouse hepatitis virus is used as well studied examplar to reevaluate the theoretical basis of the mouse haystack model of m smith this virus-centric re-examination concludes that viruses can indeed affect and promote relative group selection
previously we discovered geldanamycin a ligand of heat shock protein 90 effectively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 replication in vitro and in vivo mouse encephalitis model in this study we demonstrate that geldanamycin has very strong activities against herpes simplex virus type 2 in vitro and in vivo mouse vagina model in mouse vagina model administration of geldanamycin suspension to vagina after virus infection protected the infected mice from death and increased the average survival days in a dose-dependent manner geldanamycin also significantly reduced virus shedding from mouse vagina all geldanamycin-treated groups were statistically significant when compared with the infected control group the high-dose group of geldanamycin 5.72 mg kg à1 was better than acyclovir group 2.86 mg kg à1 . all geldanamycin vaginal administration mockinfected groups did not show significant body weight loss although geldanamycin has strong antiviral activities against various dna and rna viruses geldanamycin is not suitable for systemic administration because of its high toxicity we consider that geldanamycin is a candidate of topical usage for the treatment of herpes simplex virus type infections
following sars-cov-2 infection a high viral load and overexuberant host immune response involving innate and acquired immunity simultaneously contributes to the pathogenesis of covid-19 and organ injury through searching pubmed and the china national knowledge infrastructure databases up to march 12 2020 no published article focusing on anti-sars-cov-2 iggmediated immune response was identified we evaluated antibody response within 35 days after symptom onset in laboratory-confirmed case with covid-19 as one component of an overall exaggerated immune activation in severe sars-cov-2 infection and developed an immune phenotyping based on late igg response and nlr that could help determine disease severity and clinical outcome of covid-19 patients severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high igg levels compared to those who with low igg levels 51.8% versus 32.3%. severity rates for patients with nlr hi igg hi nlr hi igg lo nlr lo igg hi and nlr lo igg lo phenotype was 72.3% 48.5% 33.3% and 15.6% respectively furthermore severe patients with nlr hi igg hi nlr hi igg lo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including il-2 il-6 and il-10 and decreased cd4+ t cell count compared to those with nlr lo igg lo phenotype recovery rate for severe patients with nlr hi igg hi nlr hi igg lo nlr lo igg hi and nlr lo igg lo phenotype was 58.8% 20/34 68.8% 11/16 80.0%4/5 and 100% 12/12 respectively covid-19 severity is associated with a high viral load and overexuberant igg response we developed an immune response phenotyping based on nlr and igg that could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere covid-19 patients and would be helpful in guiding clinical decision
elicitation of antibodies with potent and broad neutralizing activity against hiv by immunization remains a challenge several monoclonal antibodies mabs isolated from humans with hiv-1 infection exhibit such activity but vaccine immunogens based on structures containing their epitopes have not been successful for their elicitation all known broadly neutralizing mabs bnmabs are immunoglobulin ig gs iggs and highly somatically hypermutated which could impede their elicitation ig ms igms are on average significantly less divergent from germline antibodies and are relevant for the development of vaccine immunogens but are underexplored compared to iggs here we describe the identification and characterization of several human igm-derived mabs against hiv-1 which were selected from a large phage-displayed naive human antibody library constructed from blood lymph nodes and spleens of 59 healthy donors these antibodies bound with high affinity to recombinant envelope glycoproteins gp140s envs of hiv-1 isolates from different clades they enhanced or did not neutralize infection by some of the hiv-1 primary isolates using ccr5 as a coreceptor but neutralized all cxcr4 isolates tested although weakly one of these antibodies with relatively low degree of somatic hypermutation was more extensively characterized it bound to a highly conserved regionviruses 2010 2 548 partially overlapping with the coreceptor binding site and close to but not overlapping with the cd4 binding site these results suggest the existence of conserved structures that could direct the immune response to non-neutralizing or even enhancing antibodies which may represent a strategy used by the virus to escape neutralizing immune responses further studies will show whether such a strategy plays a role in hiv infection of humans how important that role could be and what the mechanisms of infection enhancement are the newly identified mabs could be used as reagents to further characterize conserved nonneutralizing weakly neutralizing or enhancing epitopes and modify or remove them from candidate vaccine immunogens
integrity of the intestinal epithelium is critical for proper functioning of the barrier that regulates absorption of water and restricts uptake of luminal bacteria it is maintained mainly by tight junctions tjs and adherens junctions ajs we conducted immunofluorescence if staining for in situ identification of zonula occludin zo-1 proteins for tj and e-cadherin proteins for aj in the small and large intestinal villous and crypt epithelium of nursing pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv twenty 9-day-old piglets from pedv seronegative sows were orally inoculated with pedv pc21a strain or mock at post-inoculation days pids 1-5 infected pigs showed severe watery diarrhea and/or vomiting and severe atrophic enteritis by immunohistochemistry pedv antigens were evident in enterocytes lining the villous epithelium at pids 1-5 pedv-infected pigs exhibited mildly to extensively disorganized irregular distribution and reduced expression of zo-1 or e-cadherin in villous but not crypt epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum but not in the large intestine when compared to the negative controls the structural destruction and disorganization of tj and aj were extensive in pedv-infected pigs at pids 1-3 but then appeared to reversibly recover at pid 5 as evident by increased numbers of zo-1-positive epithelial cells and markedly improved appearance of e-cadherin-positive villous epithelium our results suggest a possible involvement of structurally impaired tj and aj in the pathogenesis of pedv potentially leading to secondary bacterial infections ß
dogs and cats have been cohabiting with us for thousands of years they are the major human companions today dogs and cats live in urban areas cats and most dogs are on high carbohydrate diets and face similar life-style challenges as the human beings the health and well-being of companion animals just as their owners depends on the gut microbes providing a proper care and nutritionally balanced diet to companion animals is recognised as a part of our responsibility to maintain the health and well being of our pet however as microbiota differences may facilitate exposure to pathogens and harmful environmental influences it is prudent to search for novel tools to protect dogs and cats and at the same time the human owners from pathogens specific probiotic strains and/or their defined combinations may be useful in the canine and feline nutrition therapy and care probiotic supplementations have been successful in the prevention and treatment of acute gastroenteritis treatment of ibd and prevention of allergy in companion animals new challenges for probiotic applications include maintenance of obesity and overweight urogenital tract infections helicobacter gastritis and parasitic infections the probiotics of human origin appear to be among the new promising tools for the maintenance of pets' health however the host-derived microorganisms might be the most appropriate probiotic source therefore more controlled trials are needed to characterise new and safe probiotic preparations with an impact on general health and well being as well as health maintenance in dogs and cats
bovine coronavirus bcv causes neonatal calf diarrhea cd and is associated with winter dysentery wd in adult dairy cattle it can also be isolated from the respiratory tracts of cattle entering feedlots monoclonal antibodies mabs specific for the hemagglutinin esterase he and spike s surface proteins of 2 bovine enteric coronavirus becv strains and two bovine respiratory coronavirus brcv strains were tested against 6 becv strains and 6 recently isolated brcv strains in order to characterize the antigenicity of bcv strains with varied tissue tropisms all mabs had high immunofluorescence if titers against becv and brcv strains indicative of conserved cross-reactive epitopes in hemagglutination inhibition hi tests the s-mabs were more broadly reactive than he-mabs the brcv and cd mabs were more broadly reactive in hi than the wd mabs
healthcare settings have played a major role in propagation of ebola virus ebov outbreaks healthcare workers hcws have elevated risk of contact with ebov-infected patients particularly if safety precautions are not rigorously practiced we conducted a serosurvey to determine seroprevalence against multiple ebov antigens among hcws of boende health zone democratic republic of the congo the site of a 2014 ebov outbreak interviews and specimens were collected from 565 consenting hcws overall 234 41.4% of enrolled hcws were reactive to at least 1 ebov protein 159 28.1% were seroreactive for anti-glycoprotein immunoglobulin g igg 89 15.8% were seroreactive for anti-nucleoprotein igg and 54 9.5% were vp40 positive additionally sera from 16 2.8% hcws demonstrated neutralization capacity these data demonstrate that a significant proportion of hcws have the ability to neutralize virus despite never having developed ebola virus disease symptoms highlighting an important and poorly documented aspect of ebov infection and progression
highlights d human antibodies against zikv are tested in mouse models d in vitro neutralizing activity correlates with in vivo protection d the most potent antibody zk2b10 provides protection against infection d zk2b10 markedly delays mortality summary zika virus zikv is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is generally benign in humans however an emergent strain of zikv has become widespread causing severe pre-and post-natal neurological defects there is now an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic agents to address this we investigated six human monoclonal antibodies with zikv epitope specificity and neutralizing activity in mouse models of zikv infection and microcephaly a single intraperitoneal injection of these antibodies conveyed distinct levels of adult and in utero protection from zikv infection which closely mirrored their respective in vitro neutralizing activities one antibody zk2b10 showed the most potent neutralization activity completely protected uninfected mice and markedly reduced tissue pathology in infected mice thus zk2b10 is a promising candidate for the development of antibody-based interventions and informs the rational design of zikv vaccine
rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by a calicivirus and is characterized by fulminant hepatitis with a fatality rate of more than 90% in adult rabbits it is not present in the united states it is spread by direct contact between rabbits by flies feeding on carcasses and experimentally by fleas and mosquitoes a single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective myxomatosis is a lethal generalized viral disease of rabbits it is endemic in wild rabbit populations and in sylvilagus spp it commonly occurs in the pacific states of the united states in warmer months the virus is spread passively on the mouthparts of mosquitoes and fleas outbreaks in farmed laboratory and pet rabbits result from spillover in wild rabbit populations a single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective rabbit fibroma virus is endemic in sylvilagus spp in north america it is spread by mosquitoes and causes a cutaneous fibroma at the inoculation site with no systemic signs of disease the fibroma generally regresses within 3 to 4 weeks of infection it is one of the most common causes of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits cottontail rabbit papillomavirus also known as shope papillomavirus is a cause of papillomas warts on nonhaired or thinly haired skin of rabbits in 66% to 80% of infected rabbits papillomas develop into carcinomas 8 to 14 months later the virus is spread from sylvilagus spp to rabbits by mosquitoes infection is uncommon rabbit oral papillomavirus occurs naturally in rabbits and is widespread among domestic rabbits in europe and the americas particularly young animals the papillomas are localized mostly on the underside of the tongue and usually regress spontaneously within a few weeks to a few months the multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits can be caused by bacteria viruses and parasites several different viruses have been isolated from rabbits with diarrhea such as rotavirus coronavirus and astrovirus whether natural outbreaks of enteritis can be caused by these viral agents alone or in conjunction with other pathogens eg clostridia spp escherichia coli and coccidia is not clear
the intestine of pigs harbors a mass of microorganisms which are essential for intestinal homeostasis and host health intestinal microbial disorders induce enteric inflammation and metabolic dysfunction thereby causing adverse effects on the growth and health of pigs in the human medicine fecal microbiota transplantation fmt which engrafts the fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into a patient recipient has shown efficacy in intestinal microbiota restoration in addition it has been used widely in therapy for human gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome given that pigs share many similarities with humans in terms of anatomy nutritional physiology and intestinal microbial compositions fmt may also be used to restore the normal intestinal microbiota of pigs however feasible procedures for performing fmt in pigs remains unclear here we summarize a standardized preparation for fmt in pigs by combining the standard methodology for human fmt with pig production the key issues include the donor selection fecal material preparation fecal material transfer stool bank establishment and the safety for porcine fmt optimal donors should be selected to ensure the efficacy of porcine fmt and reduce the risks of transmitting infectious diseases to recipients during fmt preparing for fresh fecal material is highly recommended alternatively frozen fecal suspension can also be prepared as an optimal choice because it is convenient and has similar efficacy oral administration of fecal suspension could be an optimal method for porcine fecal material transfer furthermore the dilution ratio of fecal materials and the frequency of fecal material transfer could be adjusted according to practical situations in the pig industry to meet the potential large-scale requirement in the pig industry it is important to establish a stool bank to make porcine fmt readily available future studies should also focus on providing more robust safety data on fmt to improve the safety and tolerability of the recipient pigs this standardized preparation for porcine fmt can facilitate the development of microbial targeted therapies and improve the intestinal health of pigs frontiers in microbiology | www frontiersin org frontiers in microbiology | www frontiersin org
this paper describes the results of two experiments regarding porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv1 the first one studied the existence of bottlenecks in an experimental one-to-one model of transmission in pigs while the second analysed the differences between viral quasi-species in vaccinated pigs that developed shorter or longer viraemias after natural challenge serum samples as well as the initial inoculum were deep-sequenced and a viral quasi-species was constructed per sample for the first experiment the results consistently reported a reduction in the quasi-species diversity after a transmission event pointing to the existence of bottlenecks during prrsv1 transmission however despite the identified preferred and un-preferred transmitted variants not being randomly distributed along the virus genome it was not possible to identify any variant producing a structural change in any viral protein in contrast the mutations identified in gp2 nsp9 and m of the second experiment pointed to changes in the amino acid charges and the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase structure the fact that the affected proteins are known targets of the immunity against prrsv plus the differential level of neutralizing antibodies present in pigs developing short or long viraemias suggests that the immune response selected those changes
the filoviruses ebola ebov and marburg marv cause fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates but are associated with subclinical infections in bats with rousettus aegyptiacus egyptian rousette/erb being a natural marv reservoir to understand the nature of this resistance we have analyzed the effects of filovirus infection on the transcriptomes of multiple erb tissues we have found that while the primary locus of infection was the liver transcriptomic changes occurred in multiple tissues suggesting systemic responses the transcriptional changes are indicative of inhibition of the complement system induction of vasodilation changes in coagulation modulation of iron regulation activation of a t cell response and converting macrophages from the m1 to m2 state we propose that these events are facets of a systemic anti-inflammatory state that enables effective control of the infection in bats and dissecting this state can inform how to control a filovirus infection in humans jayaprakash_bat_filovirus
human prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation in the brain of proteinase k pkresistant prion protein designated prp27 -30 detectable by the 3f4 antibody against human prp109 -112 we recently identified a new pk-resistant prp species designated prp* 20 in uninfected human and animal brains it was preferentially detected with the 1e4 antibody against human prp 97 -108 but not with the anti-prp 3f4 antibody although the 3f4 epitope is adjacent to the 1e4 epitope in the prp* 20 molecule the present study reveals that removal of the nterminal amino acids up to residue 91 significantly increases accessibility of the 1e4 antibody to prp of brains and cultured cells in contrast to cells expressing wild-type prp cells expressing pathogenic mutant prp accumulate not only prp* 20 but also a small amount of 3f4-detected pk-resistant prp27 -30 remarkably during the course of human prion disease a transition from an increase in 1e4-detected prp* 20 to the occurrence of the 3f4-detected prp27 -30 was observed our study suggests that an increase in the level of prp* 20 characterizes the early stages of prion diseases preparation of recombinant human prp recombinant human prion protein prp23 -231 and prp90 -231 were prepared as previously described . in brief 632 j yuan et al
dendritic cells loaded with antigenic peptides because of their safety and robust immune stimulation would be ideal for induction of immunity to protect against listeriosis however there is no currently accepted method to predict which peptides derived from the listeria proteome might confer protection while elution of peptides from mhc molecules after listeria infection yields high-affinity immune-dominant epitopes these individual epitopes did not reliably confer listeria protection instead we applied bioinformatic predictions of mhc class i and ii epitopes to generate antigenic peptides that were then formulated with advax™ a novel polysaccharide particulate adjuvant able to enhance cross-presentation prior to being screened for their ability to induce protective t-cell responses a combination of at least four intermediate strength mhc-i binding epitopes and one weak mhc-ii binding epitope when expressed in a single peptide sequence and formulated with advax adjuvant induced a potent t-cell response and high tnf-α and il-12 production by dendritic cells resulting in robust listeriosis protection in susceptible mice this t-cell vaccine approach might be useful for the design of vaccines to protect against listeriosis or other intracellular infections
many of the recently emerging highly virulent zoonotic diseases have a likely bat origin for example hendra nipah ebola and diseases caused by coronaviruses presumably because of their long history of coevolution most of these viruses remain subclinical in bats but have the potential to cause severe illnesses in domestic and wildlife animals and also humans spillovers from bats to humans either happen directly via contact with infected bats or indirectly via intermediate hosts such as domestic or wildlife animals by consuming food items contaminated by saliva faeces or urine of bats or via other environmental sources increasing numbers of breakouts of zoonotic viral diseases among humans and livestock have mainly been accounted to human encroachment into natural habitat as well as agricultural intensification deforestation and bushmeat consumption persecution of bats including the destruction of their roosts and culling of whole colonies has led not only to declines of protected bat species but also to an increase in virus prevalence in some of these populations educational efforts are needed in order to prevent future spillovers of bat-borne viruses to humans and livestock and to further protect bats from unnecessary and counterproductive culling
background bats are the suspected natural reservoir hosts for a number of new and emerging zoonotic viruses including nipah virus hendra virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and ebola virus since the discovery of sars-like coronaviruses in chinese horseshoe bats attempts to isolate a sl-cov from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful new stable bat cell lines are needed to help with these investigations and as tools to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions methodology/findings black flying foxes pteropus alecto were captured from the wild and transported live to the laboratory for primary cell culture preparation using a variety of different methods and culture media primary cells were successfully cultured from 20 different organs cell immortalisation can occur spontaneously however we used a retroviral system to immortalise cells via the transfer and stable production of the simian virus 40 large t antigen and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein initial infection experiments with both cloned and uncloned cell lines using hendra and nipah viruses demonstrated varying degrees of infection efficiency between the different cell lines although it was possible to infect cells in all tissue types conclusions/significance the approaches developed and optimised in this study should be applicable to bats of other species we are in the process of generating further cell lines from a number of different bat species using the methodology established in this study
this study investigated physiological and behavioral responses associated with the onset of neonatal calf diarrhea ncd in calves experimentally infected with rotavirus and assessed the suitability of these responses as early disease indicators the suitability of infrared thermography irt as a noninvasive automated method for early disease detection was also assessed forty-three calves either 1 were experimentally infected with rotavirus n = 20 or 2 acted as uninfected controls n = 23 health checks were conducted on a daily basis to identify when calves presented overt clinical signs of disease in addition fecal samples were collected to verify ncd as the cause of illness feeding behavior was recorded continuously as calves fed from an automated calf feeder and irt temperatures were recorded once per day across 5 anatomical locations using a hand-held irt camera lying behavior was recorded continuously using accelerometers drinking behavior at the water trough was filmed continuously to determine the number and duration of visits respiration rate was recorded once per day by observing flank movements the effectiveness of inoculating calves with rotavirus was limited because not all calves in the infected group contracted the virus further an unexpected outbreak of salmonella during the trial led to all calves developing ncd including those in the healthy control group therefore treatment was ignored and instead each calf was analyzed as its own control with data analyzed with respect to when each calf displayed clinical signs of disease regardless of the causative pathogen milk consumption decreased before clinical signs of disease appeared the irt temperatures were also found to change before clinical signs of disease appeared with a decrease in shoulder temperature and an increase in side temperature there were no changes in respiration rate or lying time before clinical signs of disease appeared however the number of lying bouts decreased and lying bout duration increased before and following clinical signs of disease there was no change in the number of visits to the water trough but visit duration increased before clinical signs of disease appeared results indicate that milk consumption irt temperatures of the side and shoulder number and duration of lying bouts and duration of time spent at the water trough show potential as suitable early indicators of disease
twenty 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks and 20 1-day-old commercially derived turkey poults were inoculated with a brazilian strain of turkey coronavirus tcov to study the pathogenicity and virus distribution up to 14 days post-inoculation by histopathology immunohistochemistry reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing at 2e14 dpi tcov antigens were detected in the paranasal sinus and lachrymal accessory gland harderian gland of infected chicks and in the ileum ileocaecal junction and caecum of infected poults lymphocytic inflammation was present in these tissues tcov was re-isolated from pooled tissue suspensions of nasal concha harderian gland and paranasal sinus from chicks as well as from the ileum ileocaecal junction and caecum of poults after three consecutive passages in 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs viral rna corresponding to the spike gene region 1178e2073 genome position was amplified from the upper respiratory tract of chickens and from the intestinal tract of poults and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identity as tcov this is the first description of tcov antigens and mrna in upper respiratory tissues in experimentally infected chickens
porcine circovirus pcv is one of the smallest known dna viruses in mammals at present pcvs are divided into three species pcv1 pcv2 and pcv3 pcv1 and pcv2 were found in the 1970s and the 1990s respectively whereas pcv3 was discovered recently in 2016 pcv1 does not cause diseases in pigs however pcv3 similar to pcv2 is reported to be associated with several swine diseases including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome pdns and reproductive failure pcvs are very common in domestic pigs as well as wild boars however pcvs have been occasionally isolated from non-porcine animals including ruminants such as cattle goats wild chamois and roe deers rodents such as nmri mice balb/c mice black c57 mice icr mice mus musculus and rattus rattus canines such as dogs minks foxes and raccoon dogs insects such as flies mosquitoes and ticks and shellfish moreover pcvs are frequently reported in biological products including human vaccines animal vaccines porcine-derived commercial pepsin products and many cell lines pcvs are also abundant in the environment including water samples and air samples interestingly pcv1 and/or pcv2 antibody or antigen has also been detected in sera stool samples and respiratory swab samples of human revealing zoonotic potential of pcvs thus pcvs inhabit many types of reservoirs in this review we summarize the reservoirs of pcvs and this information would be helpful in understanding the natural circulating status and possible cross-species transmission of pcvs
twenty-four volunteers at the common cold unit were divided into two groups of twelve one group was vaccinated orally with an enterovirus lev 4 and the other with nutrient broth both groups were challenged three days later with intranasal rhinovirus i and they were observed clinically and monitored by laboratory tests to see if any modification of the rhinovirus infection occurred all&he vaccinated volunteers were successfully infected with lev 4 and were excreting the enterovirus in the faeces at near maximum titres at the time of the rhinovirus infection following which 67 per cent of the volunteers were infected and 29 per cent developed symptoms however the vaccinated group did not differ from the unvaccinated in respect of the illness induced the excretion of rhinovirus type 4 or the rise of rv4 antibody titre lev4 was isolated from the nasopharynx of some of the volunteers but the rhinovirus infection was not modified even in these interferon was present in the serum and nasal washings of nine volunteers in all of whom only 3 had received the lev 4 vaccination two additional volunteers were shown to be insusceptible to reinfection with lev4 it was concluded that live enterovirus vaccination does not induce viral interference
threat here we investigate 84 pathogens and the host species most at risk for transmission with wild pigs using a network approach we assess the risk to agricultural and human health by evaluating the status of these pathogens and the co-occurrence of wild pigs agriculture and humans we identified 34 87% oie listed swine pathogens that cause clinical disease in livestock poultry wildlife and humans on average 73% of bacterial 39% of viral and 63% of parasitic pathogens caused clinical disease in other species non-porcine livestock in the family bovidae shared the most pathogens with swine 82%. only 49% of currently listed oie domestic swine diseases had published wild pig surveillance studies the co-occurrence of wild pigs and farms increased annually at a rate of 1.2% with as much as 57% of all farms and 77% of all agricultural animals co-occurring with wild pigs the increasing co-occurrence of wild pigs with livestock and humans along with the large number of pathogens shared is a growing risk for cross-species transmission diseases transmitted between humans wildlife and domestic animals are increasingly challenging public and veterinary health systems 1 2 . in north america it is estimated that at least 79% of reportable domestic animal diseases have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission maintenance or life cycle of the pathogen and at least 40% are zoonotic 3 . similarly three-fourths of all emerging infectious diseases eids of humans are zoonotic with most originating from wildlife reservoirs 4 5 . therefore diseases that arise from the livestock-wildlife interface are of paramount importance and must be an area of focus for public and veterinary health systems 6 . despite this importance cross-species transmission is one of the least studied aspects of disease ecology 7 8 .wild pigs sus scrofa that include feral domestic pigs sus scrofa domestica eurasian wild boar sus scrofa linnaeus and hybrids between the two are the most abundant free-ranging exotic ungulates in north america 9 . recently wild pigs in north america have become of increasing concern as a potential veterinary and public health threat for cross-species transmission 9 10 . research and policy addressing wild pig disease has received increased attention in recent years 9-11 . this is driven in part by substantial range expansion increasing ecological and agricultural damage and increased involvement of wild pigs in disease transmission 9 . in north america wild pigs have expanded their range to at least 41 states in the united states and three provinces in canada since the 1960s 9 10 12 and recent modeling indicates that their potential range may be far greater 13 . published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/ 2 scientific reports | 7 7821 |
to provide up-to-date information on the occurrence of cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves from sardinia italy the species implicated and their zoonotic potential 147 faecal samples from 22 cattle herds were microscopically examined for cryptosporidium oocysts positive isolates were molecularly characterised a questionnaire was developed to identify risk factors for cryptosporidium infection overall the percentage of positive calves and farms was 38.8 and 68.2% respectively the ssu rrna-based pcr identified two cryptosporidium species cryptosporidium parvum 95.8% and c bovis 4.2%. sequence analyses of the glycoprotein gp60 gene revealed that all c parvum isolates belonged to the subtype family iia iiaa15g2r1 and iiaa16g3r1 with the exception of three isolates that belonged to the subtype family iid iida20g1b and iida20 mixed logistic regression results indicated that calves aged 15-21 days were more likely to be cryptosporidium-positive the risk of being positive was also significantly higher in herds from central sardinia and in farms using non-slatted flooring in addition the application of disinfectants and milk replacers was significantly associated with higher cryptosporidium prevalence in contrast the risk of being positive was significantly reduced in halofuginone-treated calves our results reveal that a significant percentage of suckling calves are carriers of zoonotic subtypes of c parvum thus both healthy and diarrhoeic calves younger than 1 month may represent a risk for the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals
thirty colostrum-deprived piglets aged 1 day were inoculated with a korean strain of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv the purpose was to elucidate the pathogenicity and viral distribution in pedvinfected piglets over a period of 60 h by morphometric analysis in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry at 24-60 h post-inoculation hpi the villous height/crypt depth vh/cd ratio of infected pigs was significantly less than that of control pigs positive cells typically exhibited a dark black reaction product in-situ hybridization or brown reaction product immunohistochemistry in the cytoplasm without background staining pedv nucleic acid and antigen were detected in the duodenum jejunum and ileum of experimentally infected pigs the results suggested that the korean strain was virulent and caused severe villous atrophy in the small intestine q
the effect of different routes of immunization with either live or killed bovine rotavirus brv on the production of lactogenic antibody response in mice was evaluated the routes of immunization were intramuscular im oral 0 or intradermal in the mammary region imam following immunization serum antibody responses were monitored by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa following whelping the mice were allowed to stay with their mother until sacrificed on alternate days post-parturition from day l-l 1 milk from their stomach was collected for antibody titration by elisa and virus neutralization test regardless of the routes of immunization a rapid increase in serum anti-rotavirus antibody titers was observed for the first 5 wk after immunization followed by a gradual decline after parturition the mean antibody titer of lacteal secretions as determined by elisa increased gradually for 7 days with the greatest increase on day 9 followed by a decrease in anti-rotavirus antibody these titers also correlated with antibody titers in milk as measured by virus neutralization test the best lactogenic antibody response was observed when imam x im x 2 route of immunization was used with live brv as the antigen interestingly immunization via the oral route with killed brv also resulted in good antibody responses in contrast in the group where killed brv was used animals receiving 3~ orally had the highest antibody titer the distribution of different antibody subtypes in milk samples revealed igg to be the predominant antibody followed by igm and iga
in the context of long-term screening for viruses on western palaearctic bats we tested for the presence of adenovirus 1392 oropharyngeal swabs and 325 stool samples taken from 27 bat species adenoviruses were detected in 12 species of the vespertilionidae and the rhinolophidae families fifty positive respiratory and 26 positive stool samples were studied phylogenetic analyses of partial hexon protein and partial dna-dependent dna polymerase genes indicate that all these bat adenoviruses belong to the genus mastadenovirus but without constituting a monophyletic cluster according to genetic identities the new groups are distinct to the previously described bat mastadenovirus a and b species and contribute with potentially new members our data support that diversity of bat mastadenovirus is host-dependent and increase the knowledge of potentially pathogenic virus from bats due to the active role of bats as viral reservoirs the characterization of these viruses is relevant for public health
single-domain antibody sdab or nanobody possesses specific features non-accessible for conventional antibodies that make them suitable for research and biotechnological applications porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes lethal diarrhea in piglets resulting in great economic losses all over the world to detect and isolate pedv rapidly and accurately is important for the control and further research of the clinical pedv strains in this study four sdab fragments sdab-mc19/29/30/37 targeting the membrane m protein of pedv were selected from sdab library that was constructed through m protein-immunized camelus bactrianus the selected sdab-mcs were solubly expressed in escherichia coli the functional characteristics analysis revealed that the recombinant sdab-mcs have excellent binding activity and specificity to m protein but have no neutralizing activity to pedv for further application sdab-mc37 was conjugated with quantum dots to synthesize a nanoprobe for imaging pedv in vero cells the observed fluorescence in vero cells clearly reflects that pedv virions can be reliably recognized and labeled by the nanoprobe furthermore the sdab-mc29 was conjugated with superparamagnetic nanobeads to construct immunomagnetic nanobeads imnbs used to isolate pedv one pedv strain was successfully isolated from clinical fecal sample suggesting imnbs as a novel and efficient tool suitable for pedv isolation from clinical samples this study provided a novel application and substantiated the suitability of sdab as a specific binder for the isolation of viruses

oral administration of specific antibodies is an attractive approach to establish protective immunity against gastrointestinal pathogens in humans and animals the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria emphasize the need to find alternatives to antibiotics immunotherapy can also be used against pathogens that are difficult to treat with traditional antibiotics laying hens are very good producers of specific antibodies after immunization the specific antibodies are transported to the egg yolk from which the antibodies then can be purified a laying hen produces more than 20 g of yolk antibodies igy per year these antibodies also have biochemical properties that make them attractive for peroral immunotherapy they neither activate mammalian complement nor interact with mammalian fc receptors that could mediate inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract eggs are also normal dietary components and thus there is practically no risk of toxic side effects of igy yolk antibodies have been shown in several studies to prevent bacterial and viral infections
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using as antigen canine coronavirus-infected crfk cell supernatant was developed to detect antibodies against canine coronavirus ccov out of a total of 109 dog serum samples 80 which were positive by routine virus neutralisation test were also elisa positive seventeen samples which were negative by the virus neutralisation test were positive by elisa and by the confirmatory western blotting test the elisa was substantially more sensitive than the virus neutralisation test in detecting antibodies to ccov and may be used as an alternative technique to virus neutralisation
influenza vaccines that can be administered intranasally or by other needle-free delivery routes have potential advantages over injected formulations in terms of patient compliance cost and ease of global distribution supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation however at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses when delivered intranasally and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase pa and the q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites the cd8 + t cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce ifn-γ ex vivo lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo and diminish viral loads in infected mice compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory cd8 + t cells in the lung allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination these results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering cd8 + epitopes without adjuvant or cd4 + epitopes are non-inflammatory and promote more lung-resident memory cd8 + t cells compared to subcutaneous immunization
background canine adenovirus 2 parainfluenza and bordetella bronchiseptica cause respiratory disease in dogs and each has a modified live intranasal vaccine available molecular diagnostic assays to amplify specific nucleic acids are available for each of these agents if positive molecular diagnostic assay results are common after vaccination the positive predictive value of the diagnostic assays for disease would be decreased objective to determine the impact of administration of commercially available modified live topical adenovirus 2 b bronchiseptica and parainfluenza vaccine has on the results of a commercially available pcr panel animals eight puppies from a research breeding facility negative for these pathogens methods blinded prospective pilot study puppies were vaccinated with a single dose of modified live topical adenovirus 2 b bronchiseptica and parainfluenza and parenteral dose of adenovirus 2 canine distemper virus and parvovirus nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected on multiple days and submitted for pcr assay results nucleic acids of all 3 organisms contained in the topical vaccine were detected from both samples multiple times through 28 days after vaccination with higher numbers of positive samples detected between days 3 and 10 after vaccination conclusions and clinical importance vaccine status should be considered when interpreting respiratory agent pcr results if modified live vaccines have been used development of quantitative pcr and wild-type sequencing are necessary to improve positive predictive value of these assays by distinguishing vaccinate from natural infection
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv an enteric coronavirus is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped that damages intestinal epithelial cells and results in severe diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality the oral vaccine route is reported as a promising approach for inducing protective immunity against pedv invasion furthermore dendritic cells dcs professional antigen-presenting cells link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment in this study in order to explore an efficient oral vaccine against pedv infection a mucosal dc-targeting oral vaccine was developed using lactobacillus casei to deliver the dc-targeting peptide dcpep fused with the pedv core neutralizing epitope coe antigen this probiotic vaccine could efficiently elicit secretory immunoglobulin a siga-based mucosal and immunoglobulin g igg-based humoral immune responses via oral vaccination in vivo significant differences p < 0.05 in the immune response levels were observed between probiotics expressing the coe-dcpep fusion protein and coe antigen alone suggesting better immune efficiency of the probiotics vaccine expressing the dc-targeting peptide fused with pedv coe antigen this mucosal dc-targeting oral vaccine delivery effectively enhances vaccine antigen delivery efficiency providing a useful strategy to induce efficient immune responses against pedv infection

a single dose of vaccine for mycoplasma bovis pneumonia inactivated with saponin was inoculated subcutaneously into 3-4 week-old calves the calves were challenged 3 weeks later with a virulent strain of m bovis on two occasions within 24 h using the aerosol route the calves were monitored for clinical signs and serological responses then post mortemed 3 weeks after challenge the vaccine was shown to be highly immunogenic in calves and did not cause adverse effects vaccinated calves showed few clinical signs while all unvaccinated calves developed signs of pneumonia there was a significant decrease in body weight gain in unvaccinated calves compared to vaccinates and a significant increase in lung lesions and rectal temperatures in unvaccinated calves the vaccine also reduced the spread of m bovis to internal organs in conclusion the m bovis vaccine produced a significant level of protection against a large virulent challenge crown
the study of human-specific infectious agents has been hindered by the lack of optimal small animal models more recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents the introduction of a targeted mutation in the il2 receptor common gamma chain gene il2rg null in mice already deficient in t and b cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice these humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 and other human-specific infectious agents however there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents this is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice including i modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity which impedes human cell engraftment ii genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function iii and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols the development of "next generation" humanized mouse models continues to provide exciting opportunities for the establishment of robust small animal models to study the pathogenesis of human-specific infectious agents as well as for testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents and experimental vaccines
immunization of mucosal surfaces has become an attractive route of vaccine delivery because of its ability to induce mucosal immunity although various methods of inducing mucosal immunity are being developed our laboratory has focused on developing adenoviruses as replication-competent and replication -incompetent vectors the present report will summarize our progress in sequencing the entire bovine adenovirus-3 genome and identifying regions which can be deleted and subsequently used as insertion sites for foreign genes in developing recombinant viral vaccines using these recombinant viruses we demonstrated the 'proof-of-principle' in developing mucosal immunity and more importantly inducing protection against bovine herpes virus in a natural host -cattle finally we demonstrated that immunity and protection occurred even in animals that had pre-existing antibodies to the vector
to explore the best prime-boost regimen and evaluate the t-cellular response memory against hcv we constructed two dna vaccine candidates pvrc-ce1e2 and paav-ce1e2 and two recombinant viruses rttv-e1e2 and raav-e1e2 and then assessed the immune response to different prime-boost patterns in balb/c mice the rttv-e1e2 boosted the immune response to hcv dna vaccine prime significantly and the inverted terminal repeat sequence harboring dna construct paav-ce1e2 was the best prime agent in this study our study provides new information for both the prime-boost regimen and long-term t-cell response for hcv vaccine development
the objectives were to determine the median infective dose id 50 of cryptosporidium parvum and to describe the dose-response relationship including associated clinical illness in experimentally challenged dairy calves within the first 24 h of life 27 test calves were experimentally challenged with c parvum oocysts and 3 control calves were sham dosed test calves received 1 of 8 possible doses 25 50 100 500 1 × 10 3 1 × 10 4 1 × 10 5 and 1 × 10 6 oocysts all 27 test calves developed diarrhea fecal oocyst shedding occurred in 25 92.6% test calves and in 0 control calves the 2 non-shedding test calves both received 25 oocysts there was an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of fecal oocyst shedding p = 0.005 there was no relationship found between dose and duration p = 0.2 or cessation p = 0.3 of fecal oocyst shedding in addition there was not a significant relationship between log-dose and the log-peak oocysts p = 0.2 or log-total oocysts p = 0.5 counted/g of feces across the dose groups there was a positive dose-response relationship between log-dose and diarrhea p = 0.01 however when controlling for other factors such as onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding dose was not a significant predictor of diarrhea p = 0.5 onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be the best predictors of diarrhea p = 0.0006 and p = 0.04 respectively the id 50 for fecal oocyst shedding was 5.8 oocysts for diarrhea was 9.7 oocysts and for fecal oocyst shedding with diarrhea was 16.6 oocysts given that the id 50 of c parvum is far less than would be excreted into the environment by a naturally infected calf prevention and control of cryptosporidiosis is a formidable challenge
apart from bat-sars-cov we have identified a novel group 1 coronavirus bat-cov hku2 in rhinolophus sinicus chinese horseshoe bats since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif rbm of sars-cov may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-sars-cov and bat-cov hku2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of r sinicus in hong kong and guangdong complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-cov hku2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome 27164 nucleotides and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome this spike protein sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its c-terminus also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the rbm of spike protein of sars-cov which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-sars-cov these suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-cov hku2 bat-sars-cov and sars-cov
bartonella spp are globally distributed bacteria that cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human bartonella infections however the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown here we studied the genetic diversity prevalence of infection across seasons and years individual risk factors and possible transmission routes of bartonella in populations of common vampire bats desmodus rotundus in peru and belize for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported phylogenetic analysis of the glta gene for a subset of pcr-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to bartonella described from vampire bats from mexico other neotropical bat species and streblid bat flies sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned central and south america implying limited spatial structure stable and nonzero bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites the odds of bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism but nearly all infected bats were infested which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission while metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of bartonella dna in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples we detected pcr positivity in individual saliva and feces suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact i e biting and environmental i e fecal exposures further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact environmental and vector-borne transmission for bat bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures plos neglected tropical diseases | https//doi bartonella are globally distributed bacteria that can cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria but little is known about how prevalence varies over time routes of transmission and the genetic diversity of bartonella in bats we present results from a two-year spatially replicated study of common vampire bats which have previously shown high infection prevalence of bartonella and could pose risks of cross-species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood we found that vampire bat bartonella is genetically diverse geographically widespread and endemic and that individual-level infection risk is highest for large male non-reproductive bats phylogenetic analysis supported vector-borne transmission and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through pcr confirming whether arthropod vectors are the main route of transmission for bat bartonella is needed for understanding infection dynamics in bats and for predicting risks of cross-species transmission to humans and livestock bartonella in vampire bats plos neglected tropical diseases | https//doi

transspecies transmission of retroviruses is a frequent event and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 is a well-known example the gibbon ape leukaemia virus galv and koala retrovirus korv two gammaretroviruses are also the result of a transspecies transmission however from a still unknown host related retroviruses have been found in southeast asian mice although the sequence similarity was limited viruses with a higher sequence homology were isolated from melomys burtoni the australian and indonesian grassland melomys however only the habitats of the koalas and the grassland melomys in australia are overlapping indicating that the melomys virus may not be the precursor of the galv viruses closely related to galv/korv were also detected in bats therefore given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in thailand and the koalas in australia are far away and that bats are able to fly over long distances the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of galv and korv deserves consideration analysis of previous transspecies transmissions of retroviruses may help to evaluate the potential of transmission of related retroviruses in the future e g that of porcine endogenous retroviruses pervs during xenotransplantation using pig cells tissues or organs
porcine parvovirus ppv is a dna virus that causes reproductive failure in gilts and sows resulting in embryonic and fetal losses worldwide epitope mapping of ppv is important for developing new vaccines in this study we used spot synthesis analysis for epitope mapping of the capsid proteins of ppv nadl-2 strain and correlated the findings with predictive data from immunoinformatics the virus was exposed to three conditions prior to inoculation in pigs native untreated high hydrostatic pressure 350 mpa for 1 h at room temperature and high hydrostatic pressure 350 mpa for 1 h at − 18°c and was compared with a commercial vaccine produced using inactivated ppv the screening of serum samples detected 44 positive spots corresponding to 20 antigenic sites each type of inoculated antigen elicited a distinct epitope set in silico prediction located linear and discontinuous epitopes in b cells that coincided with several epitopes detected in spot synthesis of sera from pigs that received different preparations of inoculum the conditions tested elicited antibodies against the vp1/vp2 antigen that differed in relation to the response time and the profile of structurally available regions that were recognized
a high throughput accurate assay for anti-sars-cov igg detection is needed for large-scale epidemiological studies the evaluation of a commercial recombinant nucleocapsid proteinbased microtitre plate enzyme immunoassay elisars tm is described the results on 150 sera from sars patients and 450 sera from non-sars controls showed that this assay had a high level of sensitivity 96.2% for late serum samples and specificity 97.8%. the performance and setup of this assay fulfills the requirement as a screening test for large-scale studies a vast majority of sars patients developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein in some patients 10/45 a high level of anti-nucleocapsid antibody appeared very early in the course of the illness in contrast a minority 4 of 105 patients never developed these antibodies the implication of differences in antibody response to the nucleocapsid protein deserves further investigation
canine coronavirus ccov is usually the cause of mild gastroenteritis in dogs and is known to have spread worldwide in the last decade as a consequence of the extraordinary large rna genome novel recombinant variants of ccov have been found that are closely related to feline and porcine strains moreover highly virulent pantropic ccov strains were recently identifi ed in dogs the molecular characterization of the ccov circulating in canine population is essential for understanding viral evolution
cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis mafa have been used as important experimental animal models for carrying out biomedical researches the results of biomedical experiments strongly depend on the immunogenetic background of animals especially on the diversity of major histocompatibility complex mhc alleles however there is much less information available on the polymorphism of mhc class i genes in cynomolgus macaques than is currently available for humans in this study we have identified 40 mafa-a and 60 mafa-b exons 2 and 3 sequences from 30 unrelated cynomolgus macaques of vietnamese origin among these alleles 28 are novel as for the remaining 72 known alleles 15 alleles are shared with other cynomolgus macaque populations and 32 are identical to alleles previously reported in other macaque species a potential recombination event was observed between mafa-a1*09102 and mafa-a1*05701 in addition the mafa-a1 genes were found to be more diverse than human hla-a and the functional residues for peptide binding sites pbs or tcr binding sites tbs in mafa-a1 have greater variability than that for non-pbs or non-tbs regions overall this study provides important information on the diversity of mafa-a and mafa-b alleles from vietnamese origin which may help researchers to choose the most appropriate animals for their studies
human papillomavirus hpv occurs in many types some of which cause cervical genital and other cancers while vaccination is available against the major cancer-causing hpv types many others are not covered by these preventive measures herein we present a bioinformatics study for the designing of multivalent peptide vaccines against multiple hpv types as an alternative strategy to the virus-like particle vaccines being used now our technique of rational design of peptide vaccines is expected to ensure stability of the vaccine against many cycles of mutational changes elicit immune response and negate autoimmune possibilities using the l1 capsid protein sequences we identified several peptides for potential vaccine design for hpv 16 18 33 35 45 and 11 types although there are concerns about the epitope-binding affinities for the peptides identified in this process the technique indicates possi bilities of multivalent adjuvanted peptide vaccines against a wider range of hpv types and tailor-made different combinations of the peptides to address frequency variations of types over different population groups as required for prophylaxis and at lower cost than are in use at the present time

objectives noroviruses novs are major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in worldwide and the lack of a cell culture system that must be considered the virus like particles vlps are used as an effective vaccine development materials and methods in the present study we investigated the expression of the major capsid protein vp1 of the genogroup ii genotype 17 gii.17 nov using recombinant baculovirus system in insect cells as well as a saliva binding blockade assay to detect their protective potency results our results showed that gii.17 vlps could be successfully generated in sf9 insect cells and electron microscopic revealed that gii.17 vlps appeared as spherical particles with a -35 nm diameter immunized mice with purified vlps produced gii.17 specific sera and could efficiently block gii.17 vlps binding to the saliva histo-blood group antigens hbgas conclusions together these results suggested that gii.17 vlps represent a promising vaccine candidate against nov gii.17 infection and strongly support further preclinical and clinical studies
in the wake of the ongoing 2014/2015 ebola virus outbreak significant questions regarding the appropriate handling of ebola virus-contaminated liquid waste remain including the persistence of ebola virus in wastewater to address these uncertainties we evaluated the persistence of ebola virus spiked in sterilized domestic sewage the viral titer decreased approximately 99% within the first test day from an initial viral titer of 10 6 tcid 50 ml −1 however it could not be determined if this initial rapid decrease was due to aggregation or inactivation of the viral particles the subsequent viral titer decrease was less rapid and infectious ebola virus particles persisted for all 8 days of the test the inactivation constant k was determined to be −1.08 2.1 days for a 90% viral titer decrease due to experimental conditions we believe these results to be an upper bound for ebola virus persistence in wastewater wastewater composition is inherently heterogeneous subsequently we caution that interpretation of these results should be made within a holistic assessment including the effects of wastewater composition dilution and potential exposure routes within wastewater infrastructure while it remains unknown if ebola virus may be transmitted via wastewater these data demonstrate a potential exposure route to infectious ebola virus via wastewater and emphasize the value of a precautionary approach to wastewater handling in an epidemic response
to analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of china we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of china we obtained 5990261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats including 2975371 assembled sequences 631490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame orf which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences 15012/631490 further the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families including 16 vertebrate viruses four plant viruses and five insect viruses all bat samples were screened by specific pcr and phylogenetic analysis using these techniques we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closelyrelated to known human/animal pathogens including coronavirus norovirus adenovirus bocavirus astrovirus and circovirus in summary this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs additionally it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans bats belong to the order chiroptera and are the second largest order of mammals after rodents this order includes 19 families and 962 species distributed across the globe 1 . more than 130 kinds of viruses have been detected in bats including more than 60 species of zoonotic viruses which are highly pathogenic in humans 2 such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronavirus sl-cov ebola virus nipah virus and hendra virus 3-6 . in 2002 sars outbreak in china infected more than 8000 people worldwide and killed at least 800 people chinese horseshoe bats were proved to be the natural reservoirs of sars-cov and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by a bat hosting sl-cov 7 . similarly middle east respiratory syndrome mers-associated coronavirus were detected in bats and required dipeptidyl peptidase 4 cell receptors for its invasion into host cells 8 . it seems likely that bats might act as natural hosts which critical roles in viral iner-host transmission in the last five years the use of second-generation sequence technology allowed us to elucidate a flood of viruses like sars-cov hepatitis b virus rotavirus and other important viruses 9-11 . in 2010 meta-genomic analysis was conducted for the first time following the second generation sequencing of oral swab and faecal samples from 41 bats of three common north american bat species the results showed that sample pools contained strong matches to at least three novel group of covs and large numbers of insect and plant virus sequences were identified 12 . one bat virome analysis conducted by ge et al on fecal samples of bats from six locations in china 13 and 97 contigs were found to be related to eukaryotic viruses including coronavirus then one bat virome analysis in myanmar conducted by he et al has identified many new mammalian viruses of myanmar bats 14 showing
pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility however the low titer of these viruses substantially limits their wider applications we developed a highly efficient pseudovirus production system capable of yielding 100 times more rabies pseudovirus than the traditional method employing the high-titer pseudoviruses we have developed robust in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays for the evaluation of rabies vaccine which traditionally relies on livevirus based assays compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test rffit our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay pbna is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility moreover the in vivo pbna assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay following intravenous administration the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen liver and brain furthermore data from in vivo pbna showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days taken together the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel pbna assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety rapidity reproducibility and high throughput capacity rabies remains an acute zoonotic disease with a case-fatality rate of approaching 100% causing almost 60000 deaths annually 12 the majority of cases are found in asia and africa 34 . although a lethal disease rabies could be effectively prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis pep regimen specifically prompt administration of vaccines in conjunction with rabies-immunoglobulins and proper wound management after exposure prevent rabies even after high-risk exposure 45 . animal studies have demonstrated that rabies-specific antibodies especially the neutralizing antibodies played an essential role in vaccine-mediated protection 6 . yet clinical evaluation of rabies vaccines in humans is not possible due to ethical considerations therefore new rabies vaccines or rabies-specific immunoglobulins must be evaluated for their potency by in vitro and in vivo assays prior to being authorized for human use 7 .the current assays for immunogenicity determination of rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin have several inherent limitations specifically vaccine-induced or natural infection-elicited antibody responses against rabies virus are determined using serological assays including the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test rffit 8 fluorescent antibody virus neutralization favn test 9 and enzyme linked immunosorbant assay elisa 10 . currently the "gold standard" for in vitro assays are rffit and favn both of which are routinely used in who reference laboratories however both assays require the use of live rabies viruses which must be handled in biosafety level 2 bsl-2 containment facilities 8 9 11 . although inactivated viruses are used as coating antigens in
the investigation deals with in vitro clonal propagation of l aestivum l summer snowflake a threatened amaryllidaceae plant species in bulgaria used in the pharmaceutical industry as raw material for production of galanthamine-based medicines plants of known origin and with different alkaloid profile were taken from the living collection of the institute of botany sofia bulbs were used to initiate in vitro cultures and 24 clones were multiplied the influence of the clone origin on the propagation coefficient shoot and bulblet morphology alkaloid profile and content of galanthamine lycorine and four related alkaloids was evaluated clones kept stable alkaloid profiles and for most of them high regeneration rates were noted galanthamine content of some clones was commensurable with that of bulgarian populations of l aestivum of commercial importance five clones four galanthamine-type and one lycorine-type were selected as promising for further investigation
although edible vaccines seem to be feasible antigens of human pathogens have mostly been expressed in plants that are not attractive for human consumption such as potatoes unless they are cooked boiling may reduce the immunogenicity of many antigens more recently the technology to transform fruit and vegetable plants have become perfected we transformed carrot plants with agrobacterium tumefaciens to generate plants which can be eaten raw transgenic for an immunodominant antigen of the measles virus a major pathogen in man the hemagglutinin h glycoprotein is the principle target of neutralizing and protective antibodies against measles copy numbers of the h transgene were verified by southern blot and specific transcription was confirmed by rt-pcr the h protein was detected by western blot in the membrane fraction of transformed carrot plants the recombinant protein seemed to have a 8% lower molecular weight than the viral protein although this suggests a different glycosylation pattern proper folding of the transgenic protein was confirmed by conformationaldependent monoclonal antibodies immunization of mice with leaf or root extracts induced high titres of igg1 and igg2a antibodies that cross-reacted strongly with the measles virus and neutralized the virus in vitro these results demonstrate that transgenic carrot plants can be used as an efficient expression system to produce highly immunogenic viral antigens our study may pave the way towards an edible vaccine against measles which could be complementary to the current live-attenuated vaccine

after intranasal inoculation of suckling rats mouse hepatitis virus multiplied mostly in the nasal epithelium though there were no symptoms antibodies were produced antibodies were also demonstrated in adult rats_ these findings suggest that the rat m a y be a natural host for the virus mouse hepatitis virus mhv is prevalent among mouse colonies 6 and pathogenic for immunodefieient nude 10 or suckling 4 mice but not for normal adult mice 4 10 i t is well documented that most naturally occurring infections with mhv are transmitted by apparently healthy carrier mice 4 although other species of animals may also be involved in transmission antibodies against some strains of mhv have been detected in the sera of other species such as human or rat 8 but these antibodies may be evoked by mhv or other coronaviruses that crossreact with mhv when inoculated experimentally by intracerebral route hamsters and rats as well as mice were shown to be sensitive to a strain of 5~v j h m i 5 but there was no evidence that mhvs infect these animals when inoculated perormly or intranasmly i n 7 13 the routes by which natural infection is likely to occur 9 16 in the present paper we describe the multiplication of mhv and the production of neutralizing antibody in the rat after i n inoculation ten-day-old wistar rats were purchased from a commercial breeder and inoculated with 105 p f u of a low-virulent strain of mhv namely mhv-s 14 the multiplication of the virus 15 the distribution of viral antigen 15 histopathological changes 16 and the ant ibody responses 9 were examined as reported elsewhere
background bats receive increasing attention in infectious disease studies because of their well recognized status as reservoir species for various infectious agents this is even more important as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species nevertheless infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans but the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date methodology/principal findings between 2002 and 2009 486 deceased bats of 19 european species family vespertilionidae were collected in different geographic regions in germany most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments the bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically bacteriologically and virologically trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases with fatal bacterial viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated conclusions/significance our data demonstrate the importance of diseases and infectious agents as cause of death in european bat species the clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates indicate that maternity colonies are more susceptible to infectious agents underlining the possible important role of host physiology immunity and roosting behavior as risk factors for infection of bats

in 1967 the first reported filovirus hemorrhagic fever outbreak took place in germany and the former yugoslavia the causative agent that was identified during this outbreak marburg virus is one of the most deadly human pathogens this article provides a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge about marburg virus disease ranging from ecology to pathogenesis and molecular biology
the current circulating swine influenza virus iv subtypes in europe h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 are associated with clinical outbreaks of disease however we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other iv strains that are able to cross the species barrier in this work we extended our investigations into whether different iv strains able to cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune responses that could be associated with pathological lesions for this purpose we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours in which healthy pigs had been infected with a h3n2 swine iv and four different h3n8 iv strains circulating in different animal species pigs had been clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at 3 6 and 21 days post infection in the present study all groups but mock exhibited antibody responses to iv nucleoprotein protein pulmonary lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs infected with the swine-adapted virus interestingly pigs infected with avian and seal h3n8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral replication whereas equine and canine ivs did not cause overt pathological signs and replication was barely detectable swine iv infection induced interferon ifn-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in bronchoalveolar fluids balf at day 3 post infection as opposed to the other nonswine-adapted virus strains however ifn-alpha responses to the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the local constitutive expression of ifn-alpha genes remarkably the equine strain gave rise to a serum amyloid a response in balf despite little if any replication each virus strain could be associated with expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection these responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune system
this study describes an antibody-dependent nk cell degranulation assay as a biomarker to assess antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc response in influenza plasma and for antibody therapies against influenza infection the concentration of neutralizing antibodies nabs against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine however this is a limited assessment of protection because i nab titers that incur full protection vary and ii nab titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime adcc play a vital role in controlling influenza infections and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza this report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses nk cell activation as a marker of adcc in which nk cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation surrogate cd107a expression a positive correlation was determined between hai titers and sustained nk cell activation although nk cell activation was seen in plasma samples with hai titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high hai titers furthermore sustained nk cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment we conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant
whether bovine myelin basic protein bp and bovine spinal cord protein scp cross-react at the humoral immune level was assessed with a sensitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay we found that a hyperimmune anti-scp serum reacted strongly with scp and cross-reacted nearly as well with bp a hyperimmune anti-bp serum reacted only with bp antigenic competition analysis revealed that scp and bp both inhibited binding of the hyperimmune anti-scp serum to solid-phase adsorbed scp and bp while only bp inhibjted binding of the hyperimmune anti-bp serum to solid-phase adsorbed bp finally bp cross-reactivity antibodies were present in early bleedings from rabbits immunized with scp that had been passed through an anti-bp immunosorbent column these results clearly show there is a one-way humoral immune cross-reactivity between scp and bp which goes in the direction of scp to bp
background haemonchus contortus h contortus is one of the most important parasites that cause huge economic losses to small ruminant industry worldwide effective prognosis and treatment depend upon the early diagnosis of h contortus infection to date no widely-approved methods for the identification of prepatent h contortus infection are available to identify prepatent h contortus infection properly the aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant cold shock h contortus protein rhc-cs during early and late infections of h contortus in goat results purified rhc-cs exhibited a clear band with a molecular weight about 38 kda h contortus eggs were not detected by fecal egg count technique from feces collected at 0 to 14 days post infection d p i however eggs were detected at 21 28 and 35 d p i hence results of immunoblotting assay showed specific anti rhc-cs antibody detection in all goat sera collected at early stage 14 d p i and late stage 21-103 d p i of h contortus infection furthermore no cross reactivity was observed against trichinella spiralis fasciola hepatica and toxoplasma gondii or uninfected goats among several evaluated rhc-cs indirect-elisa format variables favorable antigen coating concentration was found 0.28 μg/well at 37°c 1 h and overnight at 4°c moreover optimum dilution ratio of serum and rabbit anti-goat igg was recorded as 1100 and 14000 respectively the best blocking buffer was 5% bovine serum albumin bsa while the best time for blocking serum incubation and tmb reaction were recorded as 60 120 and 10 min respectively the cut-off value for positive and negative interpretation was determined as 0.352 od 450 . the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the rhc-cs both were recorded as 100%. conclusion these results validated that rhc-cs is a potential immunodiagnostic antigen to detect the specific antibodies during early and late h contortus infections in goat

antibody therapeutics are one of the fastest growing classes of pharmaceuticals with an annual us market over $20 billion developed to treat a variety of diseases including cancer autoimmune and infectious diseases most are currently administered as a single molecule to treat a single disease however there is mounting evidence that cocktails of multiple antibodies each with a unique binding specificity and protective mechanism may improve clinical efficacy here we review progress in the development of oligoclonal combinations of antibodies to treat disease focusing on identification of synergistic antibodies we then discuss the application of modern antibody engineering technologies to produce highly potent antibody preparations including oligoclonal antibody cocktails and truly recombinant polyclonal antibodies specific examples illustrating the synergy conferred by multiple antibodies will be provided for diseases caused by botulinum toxin cancer and immune thrombocytopenia the bioprocessing and regulatory options for these preparations will be discussed
biodegradable nanoparticle-based vaccine development research is unexplored in large animals and humans in this study we illustrated the efficacy of nanoparticle-entrapped uv-killed virus vaccine against an economically important respiratory viral disease of pigs called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv we entrapped plga nanoparticles with killed prrsv antigens nano-kag and detected its phagocytosis by pig alveolar macrophages single doses of nano-kag vaccine administered intranasally to pigs upregulated innate and prrsv specific adaptive responses in a virulent heterologous prrsv challenge study nano-kag vaccine significantly reduced the lung pathology and viremia and the viral load in the lungs immunologically enhanced innate and adaptive immune cell population and associated cytokines with decreased secretion of immunosuppressive mediators were observed at both mucosal sites and blood in summary we demonstrated the benefits of intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-based viral vaccine in eliciting cross-protective immune response in pigs a potential large animal model
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov also known as porcine coronavirus hku15 was first detected in north america in early 2014 and associated with enteric disease in pigs resulting in an urgent need to further investigate the ecology of this virus while assays detecting nucleic acids were implemented quickly assays to detect anti-pdcov antibodies have not been available in this study an indirect anti-pdcov igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the putative s1 portion of the spike protein was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-pdcov igg in u s pigs the diagnostic sensitivity of the pdcov elisa was 91% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%. a total of 968 serum samples were tested including samples with confirmed infection with pdcov porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus there was no cross-reactivity with any of the other coronaviruses among 355 arbitrarily selected serum samples collected in 2014 and originating from 51 farms across 18 u s states anti-pdcov igg antibodies were detected in 8.7% of the samples and in 25.5% of the farms whereas anti-pedv igg was detected in 22.8% of the samples and in 54.9% of the farms in addition anti-pdcov igg antibodies were detected in archived samples collected in 2010 perhaps indicating an earlier undetected introduction into the u s pig population overall the obtained data suggest that pdcov seroprevalence in u s pigs is lower compared to pedv and pdcov may have been introduced to the u s prior to pedv
infectious diseases have a very high impact on animal and human health and welfare today despite of strong efforts and good results in diagnostics vaccine developments and control measures including the early warning systems there are many reasons which contribute to the spread of infectious diseases such as the open borders of the european union allowing rather free movement of animals over a whole continent the globalization the released and accelerated international and national trade and animal transfer simultaneously the emergence and re-emergence of new or already known pathogens is a serious issue in veterinary and in human medicine this scenario is clearly illustrated by the regular occurrence of transboundary animal diseases tads such as foot-and-mouth disease fmd classical swine fever csf african swine fever asf among others the recent occurrence of african swine fever in the caucasus region and the spread afterwards to large territories of russia clearly illustrates that our health authorities require a
viruses of wild and domestic animals can infect humans in a process called zoonosis and these events can give rise to explosive epidemics such as those caused by the hiv and ebola viruses while humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses those that can successfully infect and transmit between humans are exceedingly rare the key event in zoonosis is when an animal virus begins to replicate one virion making many in the first human subject only at this point will the animal virus first experience the selective environment of the human body rendering possible viral adaptation and refinement for humans in addition appreciable viral titers in this first human may enable infection of a second thus initiating selection for viral variants with increased capacity for spread we assert that host genetics plays a critical role in defining which animal viruses in nature will achieve this key event of replication in a first human host this is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few or no genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump only experimental virology provides a path to identifying animal viruses with the potential to replicate themselves in humans because this information will not be evident from viral sequencing data alone citation warren cj sawyer sl 2019 how host genetics dictates successful viral zoonosis plos biol 174 e3000217 https//doi

members of family coronaviridae cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev a lesserresearched coronavirus can infect naive pigs of any age but clinical disease is observed in pigs յ4 weeks of age no commercial phev vaccines are available and neonatal protection from phev-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity although subclinical phev infections are thought to be common phev ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown to begin to address this gap in knowledge a serum igg antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the s1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate phev seroprevalence in u s sow herds assessment of the diagnostic performance of the phev s1 elisa using serum samples n ϭ 924 collected from 7-week-old pigs n ϭ 84 12 pigs per group inoculated with phev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine respiratory coronavirus or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of ն0.6 was both sensitive and specific i e all phev-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42 and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups the phev s1 elisa was then used to estimate phev seroprevalence in u s sow herds 19 states using 2756 serum samples from breeding females ͼ28 weeks old on commercial farms n ϭ 104 with no history of phev-associated disease the overall seroprevalence was 53.35% confidence interval ϯ1.86% and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% ci ϯ3.70%. importance there is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev in commercial swine herds this study provided evidence that phev infection is endemic and highly prevalent in u s swine herds these results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic phev on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations regardless the availability of the validated phev s1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor phev infections confirm prior exposure to the virus and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and salmonella choleraesuis are two leading causes of economic loss in the swine industry while respiratory disease is common in both s choleraesuis and prrsv infections the factors that contribute to its development remain largely unde®ned we investigated the interaction of prrsv s choleraesuis and stress in 5-weekold swine all combinations of three factors inoculation with s choleraesuis on day 0 prrsv on day 3 and treatment with dexamethasone on days 3±7 were used to produce eight treatment groups in two independent trials fecal samples tonsil and nasal swabs serum samples and postmortem tissues were collected for bacteriologic and virologic examinations no clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with only prrsv or only s choleraesuis in contrast pigs which were dually infected with s choleraesuis and prrsv exhibited unthriftiness rough hair coats dyspnea and diarrhea the pigs which received all three treatment factors were the most severely affected and 43% three of seven of the animals in this group died individuals in this group shed signi®cantly higher quantities of s choleraesuis in feces and had signi®cantly higher serum prrsv veterinary microbiology 71 2000 177±192 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 9 9 0 0 1 7 5 -3 titers compared to other treatments p 0.05 in addition s choleraesuis and prrsv were shed longer and by more pigs in this group than other groups and s choleraesuis was recovered from more tissues in this group on day 21 post inoculation these results suggested that prrsv s choleraesuis and dexamethasone acted synergistically to produce a syndrome similar to that observed in the ®eld #
though agriculture is often viewed as one of humanity's crowning achievements skeletal evidence indicates that dependence on domesticated plants and animals was accompanied by an increase in infectious disease scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens here we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins analyzing these data using the epidemiological transi-tion framework genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted we also consider the broader effect of agriculture upon the microbiome exploring potential consequences for human health we end by discussing the changes in the human microbe-scape we are likely to see in the future am j phys anthropol 57135-152 2013 v c 2013 wiley periodicals inc
the emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses hcovs in the last two decades has illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in human populations and disrupt global economies global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hcov infections therefore understanding how hcov-host interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hcovs in humans pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hcov-host interactions that govern pathogenesis notably tractable mouse genetics combined with hcov reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virus-host interaction networks in disease in addition to assessing etiologies of known hcovs mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent covs knowledge of cov pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness an overarching directive of the world health organization although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates we focus this review on the current state of hcov mouse models their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hcov-host interactions and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions
in africa bat-borne zoonoses emerged in the past few decades resulting in large outbreaks or just sporadic spillovers in addition hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential we discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology evolution distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs the detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event we summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on african bats as reservoirs for corona- filo- paramyxo-and lyssaviruses we highlight that important information on epidemiology bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential even if knowledge gaps exist it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services this necessitates a multidisciplinary one health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species
to determine the prevalence of antibodies to four major canine viruses serum samples were obtained from 190 dogs presented to the small animal hospital at the university of liverpool antibodies to canine coronavirus ccv canine distemper virus cdv canine parvovirus cpv and rotavirus rv were assayed using serum neutralisation ccv and cdv haemagglutination inhibition cpv and indirect fluorescent antibody rv techniques overall 54 per cent of dogs were seropositive to ccv 84 per cent to cdv 70 per cent to cpv and 86 per cent to rv the antibody titres obtained were analysed with respect to a number of different parameters including age sex breed vaccination status exercise regime diet liverpool district in which the dog resided and the presence of diarrhoea the prevalence and titres of antibodies to ccv cdv and rv appeared to be influenced by age cdv by vaccination status and ccv by the presence of diarrhoea no other influencing parameters were found
japanese encephalitis je is a serious leading health complication emerging expansively that has severely affected the survival rate of human beings this fatal disease is caused by je virus jev the current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent jev based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches octapeptide b-cell and hexapeptide t-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins viz e prm ns1 ns3 and ns5 of jev were determined hydrophilicity antigenicity immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated further the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters e g total net charges amino acid composition and boman index out of all the epitopes a total of four t-cell epitopes namely kradss krsrrs skrsrr and kecpde and one b-cell epitope i e pkpcskgd were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen taking into account the outcome of this study the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against jev the peptide vaccine being cost effective could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in jev infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population however prior to administration into human beings the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes a severe clinical enteric disease in suckling neonates with up to 100% mortality resulting in devastating economic losses to the pork industry in recent years maternal immunity via colostrum and milk is a vital source to neonates of passive protection against diarrhea dehydration and death caused by pedv comprehensive information on neutralizing activity na against pedv in mammary secretions is critically important for assessing the protective capacity of sows therefore the objectives of this study were to characterize anti-pedv neutralizing activity in mammary secretions anti-pedv na was present in colostrum milk and serum from pedv-infected sows as determined both by immunofluorescence and elisa-based neutralizing assays with neutralization levels higher in colostrum and milk than in serum the highest na was observed in colostrum on day 1 and decreased rapidly in milk at day 3 then gradually declined from day 3 to day 19 post-farrowing notably the na in mammary secretions showed various patterns of decline over time of lactation that may contribute to variation in sow protective capacities the kinetics of na decline were associated with total iga and igg antibody levels neutralizing activity significantly correlated with specific iga primarily to spike domain 1 s1 and domain 2 s2 proteins of pedv rather than to specific igg in colostrum subsequently the na in milk was mainly related to specific iga to s1 and s2 during lactation
sudan virus sudv outbreaks in africa are highly lethal however the development and testing of novel antivirals and vaccines for this virus has been limited by a lack of suitable animal models non-human primates nhp remain the gold standard for modeling filovirus disease but they are not conducive to screening large numbers of experimental compounds and should only be used to test the most promising candidates therefore other smaller animal models are a valuable asset we have recently developed a guinea-pig adapted sudv virus that is lethal in guinea pigs in our current study we show that ferrets are susceptible to wild-type sudv providing a small animal model to directly study clinical isolates screen experimental anti-sudv compounds and potentially study viral transmission
in this work we study the consequences of sequence variations of the "2009 h1n1" swine or mexican flu influenza a virus strain neuraminidase for drug treatment and vaccination we find that it is phylogenetically more closely related to european h1n1 swine flu and h5n1 avian flu rather than to the h1n1 counterparts in the americas homology-based 3d structure modeling reveals that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the active site the latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir tamiflu ® zanamivir relenza ® and peramivir thus the drugs should remain effective for treatment however the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine development serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous strains and already vary among patients
feces collected from 40 horses with diarrhea and 34 horses without diarrhea were examined to determine if an association existed between isolation of aeromonas spp and diarrhea samples were also examined for salmonella spp and identification of viruses and parasite ova neither salmonella spp nor aeromonas spp were isolated from the feces of 34 control horses aeromonas spp were isolated from feces of 22 of 40 55% horses with diarrhea salmonella spp were isolated from feces of 8 20% horses and of these 5 12.5% were also positive for aeromonas spp twenty-nine isolates of aeromonas spp were recovered from the feces of 22 diarrheic horses of these isolates more than 80% were susceptible on in vitro testing to amikacin ceftiofur chloramphenicol and gentamicin all isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin diarrheic horses positive for aeromonas were significantly p ϭ .04 older than diarrheic horses negative for aeromonas spp a significantly greater number of fecal samples were positive for aeromonas spp during march through august than samples examined in other months p ϭ .014 results of this study indicate that aeromonas spp should be considered as a cause of diarrhea in horses
serum samples from 214 swedish cats with no signs of infectious disease were analysed for the presence of antibodies against chlamydophila felis cp felis while 209 of these were also analysed for feline coronavirus fcov antibodies the prevalence of antibodies against cp felis was 11% with no significant difference between purebred and mixed breed cats the overall prevalence of antibodies against fcov was 31% significantly higher among pure breed cats 65% than among mixed breed cats 17%. a high proportion of cats with antibodies against fcov had relatively high antibody titres and was therefore likely to be shedding fcov in faeces for cp felis the majority of seropositive animals had relatively low antibody titres and the risk of these animals infecting others is not known
nal antibodies protect immunoglobulin deficient neonatal mice from mouse hepatitis virus mhv-associated wasting syndrome ajri 19963633-39 0 munksgaard copenhagenproblem neonatal mice nursed by dams lacking immunoglobulins igs may often suffer from lethal runting if raised under conventional conditions the present study was performed in order to clarify a the cause of the wasting syndrome and b the protective role of antigen-specific milk antibodies method ig-deficient mouse embryos in a conventional environment were embryotransferred to specified pathogen free spf dams neonatal growth mortality and health status of mice from both environments was recorded suspected presence of mouse hepatitis virus mhv was tested by rt-pcr protective effects on neonatal mortality of milk containing different titers of anti-mhv antibodies were investigated in cross-fostering experiments results the spf colony of ig-deficient mice exhibited no breeding problems whereas ig-deficient neonates in the conventional environment suffered from lethal wasting syndrome serological screening of the mice kept in the two environments revealed that mice in the conventional room had high titers of antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus presence of mhv in runting neonates was confirmed by pathological examinations and rt-nested-pcr using mhv genome specific primers milk containing high titers of anti-mhv antibodies when provided for 8 days or more completely prevented ig-deficient neonates from developing wasting syndrome in the conventional environment conclusion these findings show that the neonatal wasting syndrome is associated with the presence of mhv and that neonates are efficiently protected by mhv-specific antibodies in the milk
different species of camelids play an important role in the epidemiology of various emerging infectious diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome for precise investigations of the immunopathogenesis in these host species appropriate immunohistochemical markers are highly needed in order to phenotype distinct immune cells populations in camelids so far specific immunohistochemical markers for camelid immune cells are rarely commercially available and cross-reactivity studies are restricted to the use of frozen dromedary tissues to bridge this gap 14 commercially available primary antibodies were tested for their suitability to demonstrate immune cell populations on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded ffpe tissue sections of dromedaries bactrian camels llamas and alpacas in the present study out of these 9 antibodies directed against cd3 cd20 cd79␣ hla-dr iba-1 myeloid/histiocyte antigen cd204 cd208 and cd68 antigen exhibited distinct immunoreaction patterns to certain camelid immune cell subsets the distribution of these antigens was comparatively evaluated in different anatomical compartments of thymus spleen mesenteric and tracheobronchial lymph nodes the presented results will provide a basis for further investigations in camelids especially with respect to the role of the immune response in certain infectious diseases which harbor a considerable risk to spill over to other species
in the last few decades there is an increasing emergence and re-emergence of viruses such as west nile virus enterovirus 71 and henipaviruses that cause epidemic viral encephalitis and other central nervous system cns manifestations the mortality and morbidity associated with these outbreaks are significant and frequently severe while aspects of epidemiology basic virology etc may be known the pathology and pathogenesis are often less so partly due to a lack of interest among pathologists or because many of these infections are considered ''third world'' diseases in the study of epidemic viral encephalitis the pathologist's role in unravelling the pathology and pathogenesis is critical the novel henipavirus infection is a good example the newly created genus henipavirus within the family paramyxoviridae consists of two viruses viz hendra virus and nipah virus these two viruses emerged in australia and asia respectively to cause severe encephalitides in humans and animals studies show that the pathological features of the acute encephalitis caused by henipaviruses are similar and a unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and parenchymal cell infection in the cns mainly neurons and other organs causes severe tissue damage both viruses can cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection due to a true recurrent infection as evidenced by the presence of virus in infected cells future emerging viral encephalitides will no doubt continue to pose considerable challenges to the neuropathologist and as the west nile virus outbreak demonstrates even economically advanced nations are not spared
in this study swine fecal specimens n = 251 collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by rt-pcr porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % 33/251 of the samples we demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in kenya and uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs nursing piglets 15 % post-weaning 3month-old pigs 17 % 4-month-old pigs 10 %. genetic analysis of the partial rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp region 690 nt revealed that kobuviruses circulating in east africa are diverse sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses respectively the nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 % 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 % respectively additionally upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp rt-pcr bands while using the same primer set we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses to our knowledge this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an african region further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies

bovine coronavirus bcov is associated with severe diarrhea in calves winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory diseases in cattle of all ages this study aimed to investigate the relationship between white blood cell counts and haptoglobin hp and serum amyloid a saa levels in post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by bcov and those that recovered from diarrhea blood and fecal samples were collected twice from the same animals 17 postweaned calves with diarrhea first and 15 post-weaned calves that recovered from diarrhea second real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that all 17 fecal samples from post-weaned calves with diarrhea and one out of 15 from diarrhea-recovered calves were positive for bcov and negative for cryptosporidium spp escherichia coli k99 salmonella spp bovine rotavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus no eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method in comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea in diarrhea-recovered calves the lymphocyte count was significantly higher p = 0.018 and the monocyte count was significantly lower p = 0.001 however the number of monocytes was still high post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher hp concentration p < 0.001 compared with diarrhea-recovered calves the results indicated that increased hp concentration and monocytosis but not saa may be associated with diarrhea caused by bcov the present study suggests that the monitoring of hp concentration and monocyte count is useful in the diagnosis of post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by bcov in this field
we constructed a food-grade expression system harboring a f1s1 fusion protein of bordetella pertussis to be produced in lactococcus lactis nz3900 as a new oral vaccine model against whooping cough caused by b pertussis f1s1 was composed of n-terminally truncated s1 subunit of pertussis toxin and type i immunodominant domain of filamentous hemagglutinin which are both known as protective immunogens against pertussis the recombinant l lactis was administered via oral or intranasal routes to balb/c mice and the related specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were then evaluated the results indicated significantly higher levels of specific iga in the lung extracts and igg in sera of mucosally-immunized mice compared to their controls it was revealed that higher levels of igg2a compared to igg1 were produced in all mucosally-immunized mice moreover immunized mice developed th1 responses with high levels of ifn-γ production by the spleen cells these findings provide evidence for l lactis to be used as a suitable vehicle for expression and delivery of f1s1 fusion protein to mucosa and induction of appropriate systemic and mucosal immune responses against pertussis
background bovine coronavirus bcov is a widely distributed pathogen causing disease and economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals the aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of bcov shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naïve in-contact calves three weeks after bcov infection methods a live animal experiment was conducted with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure four naïve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized two naïve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure nasal swabs feces blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral rna by rt-qpcr and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs serum was analyzed for bcov antibodies results the calves showed mild general signs and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system the overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral rna the first three weeks after challenge general depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of bcov rna while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding and the calves had detectable amounts of viral rna intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28 however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated viral rna was not detected in blood but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge although the calves were shedding bcov rna 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected conclusions prolonged shedding of bcov rna can occur but detection of viral rna does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential the study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices
background existing methods for preparing influenza vaccines pose the greatest challenge against highly pandemic avian influenza h7n9 outbreak in the poultry and humans exploring a new strategy for manufacturing and delivering a safe and effective h7n9 vaccine is needed urgently results an alternative approach is to develop an influenza h7n9 oral vaccine based on yeast display technology in a timely manner hemagglutinin ha of a/anhui/1/2013 ah-h7n9 is used as a model antigen and characterized its expression on the surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae s cerevisiae eby 100 mice administrated orally with s cerevisiae eby100/pyd5-ha produced significant titers of igg antibody as well as significant amounts of cytokines ifn-γ and il-4 importantly s cerevisiae eby100/pyd5-ha could provide effective immune protection against homologous a/ anhui/1/2013 ah-h7n9 virus challenge our findings suggest that platform based on yeast surface technology provides an alternative approach to prepare a promising influenza h7n9 oral vaccine candidate that can significantly shorten the preparedness period and result in effective protection against influenza a pandemic
transmission of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans through direct and indirect contact with bats raises public apprehension about living close to bats in the township of ve golokuati in ghana several "camps" of epomophorus gambianus roost in fruit trees that provide ecosystems services for residents this study explored human-bat interaction in the township and the potential risks of disease transmission from bats to humans data were derived through questionnaire administration and participatory appraisal approach involving focus group discussions participatory landscape mapping and transect walk the study found that most human activities within the township such as petty-trading domestic chores and children's outdoor recreation exposed people to bats though there have been no reported cases of disease spillover from bats to humans from the perspective of residents and from medical records respondents whose activities brought them closer to bats within the township were found to be more likely to experience fevers than those who do not interact with bats frequently the study recommends education of community members about the potential risks involved in human-bat interactions and makes suggestions for reducing the frequent interactions with and exposure to bats by humans
felis margarita loche 1858 is a felid commonly called the sand cat it is 1 of 6 species in the genus felis one of the smallest of the wild cats felis margarita is adapted behaviorally and morphologically to live in desert environments prey includes rodents birds reptiles and arthropods this species has a wide but disjunct distribution through northern africa the arabian peninsula and southwest and central asia f margarita occurs at low densities throughout its range and is listed as "near threatened" by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources due to habitat degradation and its low and potentially declining population f margarita is bred in zoos in north america and europe
since the first identification of the virus in 1971 the disease caused by canine coronavirus ccov has not been adequately investigated and the role that the virus plays in canine enteric illness has not been well established only after the emergence in 2002 of sars in human has new attention been focused on coronaviruses as a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of rna-positive stranded viruses ccov has evolved and with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades new virus strains serotypes and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs considering the widespread nature of ccov infections among dog populations several studies have been carried out focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of ccovs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections this paper reports the evolutionary processes of ccovs with a note onto recent diagnostic methods
unlike the original canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 cpv-2 variants have gained the ability to replicate in vivo in cats but there is limited information on the disease patterns induced by these variants in the feline host during 2008 two distinct cases of parvoviral infection were diagnosed in our laboratories a cpv-2a variant was identified in a 3-month-old persian kitten displaying clinical sign of feline panleukopenia fpl acute gastroenteritis and marked leukopenia and oral ulcerations that died eight days after the onset of the disease two pups living in the same pet shop as the cat were found to shed a cpv-2a strain genetically identical to the feline virus and were likely the source of infection also non-fatal infection by a cpv-2c strain occurred in a 2.5-month-old european shorthair kitten displaying non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea and normal white blood cell counts by sequence analysis of the major capsid protein vp2 gene the feline cpv-2c strain showed 100% identity to a recent canine type-2c isolate both kittens had been administered multivalent vaccines against common feline pathogens including fpl virus whether and to which extent the fpl vaccines can protect cats adequately from the antigenic variants of cpv-2 should be assessed
enterovirus 71 ev71 is a single-strand rna virus that causes hand foot and mouth disease hfmd in infants and young children leading to neurological complications with significant morbidity and mortality unfortunately the pathogenesis of ev71 infection is not well understood in this study we investigated the il-17f rs1889570 and rs4715290 gene polymorphisms in a chinese han population severe cases and cases with ev71 encephalitis had a significantly higher frequency of the rs1889570 t/t genotype and t allele the serum il-17f levels in rs1889570 t/t and c/t genotypes were also significantly elevated when compared to c/c genotypes however there was no significant difference observed in rs4715290 genotype distribution and allele frequency these findings suggest that il-17f rs1889570 gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with the susceptibility to severe ev71 infection in chinese han children

bovine coronavirus bcov is a causative agent of respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle and calves bcov infection was also evident in captive wild ruminants recently water deer are recognized as the most common wildlife to approach farmhouses and livestock barns in korea therefore we investigated 77 nasal swab samples from non-captive wild water deer hydropotes inermis between november 2016 and september 2017 and identified three samples positive for coronavirus indicating potential for respiratory shedding the full genomic sequences of the water deer coronavirus were closely related to bcov >98%. therefore effective biosecurity system in bovine farms would be necessary to prevent contact between farm ruminants and free-ranging wild water deer bovine coronavirus carrier nasal swab water deer
background currently diagnosis of equine coronavirus ecov relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular detection of ecov in feces or tissue although this approach is complete it is costly and may not always be achievable objective we hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ecov in hospitalized horses is low our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ecov in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization animals one-hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the washington state university veterinary teaching hospital for gastrointestinal disease n = 65 or for imaging under anesthesia n = 65 that were hospitalized for 48 hours owner consent was obtained before sampling methods fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later polymerase chain reaction pcr for ecov and electron microscopy em were performed on all samples results only 1 of 258 fecal samples was pcr-positive for ecov electron microscopy identified ecov-like particles in 9 of 258 samples parvovirus-like particles in 4 of 258 samples and rotavirus-like particles in 1 of 258 samples conclusions and clinical importance the presence of ecov in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low thus fecal samples that are pcr-positive for ecov in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance the clinical relevance of the viruses observed using em remains to be investigated k e y w o r d s anesthesia anorexia electron microscopy fever gastrointestinal disease lethargy pcr
the objective was to describe the probability of cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst shedding at different magnitudes of exposure the pattern of fecal shedding over time and factors affecting fecal shedding in dairy calves within the first 24 h of life 36 calves were experimentally challenged with c parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure 1×10 3 1×10 4 1×10 5 and 1× 10 6 oocysts and 7 control calves were sham dosed fecal shedding occurred in 33 91.7 % experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves there was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure 1×10 3 oocysts shed less than the other three groups at higher magnitudes of exposure there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding there was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf i e the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding the fewer oocysts that were shed the pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear the number of oocysts increased with time reached a peak and declined therefore the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding
introduction migratory birds act as hosts for a number of zoonotic viruses and have the ability to disperse these viruses to distant geographic locations coronaviruses covs represent a family of zoonotic viruses with wide variety of animal hosts including birds and humans the infections caused by coronaviruses vary from mild to severe depending on the viral species and the host since the coronaviruses exhibit extraordinary large rna genome also the rate of homologous recombination is high which in turn contributes to the genetic diversity and interspecies host-switches of covs the emergence of novel covs has been rich during the last decades and wild birds seem to serve as reservoirs for a variety of cov strains we examined the covs circulating among wild birds in finland materials and methods samples cloacal swab tracheal swab oropharyngeal swab or tissue representing 61 bird species were collected during 2010-2013 and examined by rt-pcr targeting the rdrp gene for the presence of cov rna results altogether 51/939 5.4% of the examined birds were found positive by rt-pcr diverse gamma-and deltacoronavirus sequences were detected discussion gamma-and deltacoronaviruses circulate among wild birds in finland the number of cov-positive birds detected each year varies greatly article history
we sought to determine whether the human leukocyte antigen-b hla-b locus has a role in the outcome of sebov disease by typing 77 cases from an outbreak in northern uganda in 2000-2001 sequence-based hla-b typing was performed using leukocytes isolated from 77 patients statistical analysis and a predictive discriminant analysis pda were applied to typing data epitope prediction software was also applied to sebov sequences statistically significant associations were found between certain sets of alleles and either fatal or nonfatal disease outcomes alleles b*67 and b*15 were associated with fatal outcomes whereas b*07 and b*14 were associated with nonfatal outcomes the pda-derived functions that were produced were 81.8% accurate in classifying patients into their correct outcome group several epitopes predicted to bind strongly to hla-b*07 molecules were identified in the viral polymerase nucleoprotein and vp35 protein hla-b alleles associated with either fatal or nonfatal outcomes of sebov disease were identified and can be used in a predictive model studies of hla-b-restricted epitopes could contribute to characterization of protective host responses and to vaccine development in human and/or nonhuman primates ebola virus ebov infections can cause a severe form of hemorrhagic fever that can lead to death if the infection is not controlled in humans infections caused by zaire ebov zebov and sudan ebov sebov have accounted for most documented cases and result in mortality rates of up to 90% and roughly 50% respectively

diarrhea and deaths in new-born camel calves were noticed by veterinary investigators and pastoralist in saudi arabia to be very high hence it is thought to be necessary to investigate this problem from the virological and bacteriological point of view the role of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in six different towns of north province al-assafia arar domat aljandal hail skaka and khoa in saudi arabia was studied survey was conducted in diarrheic camel calves aged 12 months or younger in our study calf diarrhea was reported in 184 out of 2308 camels examined clinically during one year the prevalence of diarrhea was found to be 8.0% in calves ranging from one month to one year in the present study group a rotavirus and brucella abortus were detected in 14.7% and 8.98% respectively using elisa technique escherichia coli was isolated from diarrheic calf camel 58.2% 99/170 samples during dry and wet season salmonella spp and enterococcus spp were detected in 12% and 8.8% of the specimens respectively in this study enterotoxogenic e coli et e coli was isolated from 7% of diarrheic camel which indicates the strong correlation between the camel calf diarrhea and the detection of enterotoxogenic e coli this study represented the first report for the detection of group a rotavirus and b abortus antigen and antibodies in calf
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv belongs to the genus alphacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae . pedv was identifi ed as an emerging pathogen in us pig populations in 2013 since then this virus has been detected in at least 31 states in the usa and has caused signifi cant economic loss to the swine industry active surveillance and characterization of pedv are essential for monitoring the virus obtaining comprehensive information about the pedv genome can improve our understanding of the evolution of pedv viruses and the emergence of new strains and can enhance vaccine designs in this chapter both a targeted amplifi cation method and a random-priming method are described to amplify the complete genome of pedv for sequencing using the miseq platform overall this protocol provides a useful twopronged approach to complete whole-genome sequences of pedv depending on the amount of virus in the clinical samples
pre-pube~al immunisation of mice with a formalin-inactivated type 1 and 2 herpes simplex virus vaccine conferred a level of life-long protection against primary type 2 genital infection protection levels were better with type 1 vaccine and strimngly influenced by vaccine dosage where a one-hundred-fold reduction from the standard vaccine dosage diminished protection to insignificant levels vaccine efficacy was not significantly affected by the method of virus inactivation the number of immunisations or the age of the mouse at immunisation vaccination conferred better protection than previous type 2 genital infection this may be a consequence of a higher antigenic dose more acceptable antigenic presentation or to a perversion of the immune response in a latently infected animal to homologous virus challenge the feasibility of immunisation against herpes simplex infections was first demonstrated in rabbits by lipo~utz 9 these early studies also provided evidence of the contribution of cell-mediated factors on host immunity and even hinted at possible antigenic distinctiveness between herpes simplex virus strains more recently successful immunisation against type 1 herpes virus has been demonstrated with live vaccine in mice 17 and with inactivated vaccine in mice and in rabbits 2 8 successful immunisation against type 2 herpes virus has been demonstrated in mice using a formalin-inactivated type 1 or 2 vaccine 4 and with live type 1 or 2 vaccine where however only homologous interactions were investigated 29 other studies have suggested that mice immunised with type 1 vaccine were less likely to develop a latent ganglionic type 1 or indeed type 2 herpes virus infection 3 11 .
there is a dearth of information on the seroprevalence of bovine norovirus bonov and nebovirus in cattle of the us in this retrospective study serum igg antibodies to two bovine enteric caliciviruses giii.2 bo-nov bo/cv186-oh/00/us and genetically and antigenically distinct nebovirus bo/nb/80/us were evaluated in feedlot and veal calves from different regions of the us during 1999-2001 three groups of 6-to 7-month-old feedlot calves from new mexico nm n=103 arkansas ar n=100 and ohio oh n=140 and a group of 7-to 10-day-old ohio veal calves n=47 were studied serum samples were collected pre-arrival or at arrival to the farms for the nm ar and oh calves and 35 days after arrival for all groups for monitoring seroconversion rates during the period virus-like particles of bo/cv186-oh/00/us and bo/nb/80/us were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and were used in elisa to measure antibodies a high seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 78-100 % was observed for antibodies to giii.2 bonov and nebovirus respectively in the feedlot calves tested in the ohio veal farm an antibody seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 40-66 % was found for giii.2 bonov and nebovirus respectively increased seropositive rates of 38-85 % for giii.2 bonov and 26-83 % for nebovirus were observed at 35 days after arrival and commingling on farms for all groups infection of calves with either giii.2 bonov or nebovirus or both viruses appeared to be common in the regions studied in the us during 1999-2001 these two viruses likely remain endemic because no commercial vaccines are available c thomas and k jung contributed equally to this work
an indirect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv anti-immunoglobulin ig g elisa based on the s1 portion of the spike protein was validated and compared with an indirect immunofluorescence assay in serum samples from experimentally infected pigs n = 35 anti-igg pedv antibodies were detected as early as 7 days post-infection in field serum samples n = 239 the diagnostic sensitivity of the s1 elisa was 100% and the diagnostic specificity was 94%. the s1 elisa showed no cross-reactivity with antibodies against other porcine coronaviruses colostrum samples n = 133 were also tested for anti-pedv igg and iga the diagnostic sensitivity was 92% for igg and 100% for iga and the diagnostic specificity was 90% for igg and 99.4% for iga these data suggest that the s1 elisa is a sensitive and specific test that could also be used to evaluate pedv colostral immunity
the cloning and sequencing of an eco ri-pst i fragment derived from the replicative form of a canine parvovirus cpv vaccine strain are reported the variability of the 5' end of ns 1 protein gene in the genome is confirmed by comparison with previously determined dna sequences a 15 nucleotide deletion was also observed in this vaccine strain in order to improve cpv diagnosis radioactively labelled rna or dna and biotin labelled dna obtained by random priming of the recombinant plasmid were used as probes mainly on gut or stool samples from naturally infected dogs results of filter hybridization correlated well with histopathological diagnosis of parvovirus infection and with hemagglutination tests performed on dog faeces we propose that nucleic acid hybridization may be an alternative diagnostic method to ascertain the presence of cpv especially in frozen samples
ferret coronavirus is associated with two disease presentations in ferrets namely epizootic catarrhal enteritis and a feline infectious peritonitis fip-like systemic disease in this chapter we describe conventional and real-time one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays that are routinely used in our laboratory to detect either genotype 1 or genotype 2 ferret coronavirus in clinical specimens these assays were designed based upon the conserved spike gene sequence difference found between three strains of ferret systemic coronavirus and three strains of ferret enteric coronavirus recent literature evidence indicates that pathotype is not associated with a specifi c genotype and therefore it is important to test for both genotypes either in enteric or systemic disease
neospora caninum is one of the most important causes of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide the distribution of n caninum in tissues of adult cattle is unknown and the parasite has not been demonstrated histologically in tissues of cows in the present study the distribution of n caninum in different tissues of adult cattle was evaluated by bioassays in dogs seventeen dogs 2-3 month-old were fed different tissues of 4 naturally exposed adult cattle indirect fluorescent antibody test n caninum titer ≥400 5 were fed with masseter 5 with heart 3 with liver 4 with brain and 3 pups were used as non-infected control two dogs fed masseter 2 fed heart 1 fed liver and 3 fed brain shed oocysts and all dogs presented no seroconvertion to n caninum during the observation period of 4 weeks the oocysts were confirmed as n caninum based on the detection of n caninum-specific dna by pcr and sequencing the results indicate that dogs can be infected by n caninum with different tissues of infected cattle
covid-19 is the most rapidly growing pandemic in modern time and the need for serological testing is most urgent although the diagnostics of acute patients by rt-pcr is both efficient and specific we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity we evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid within 15 minutes detection of sars-cov-2-specific igm and igg by 29 pcr-confirmed covid-19 cases and 124 negative controls the results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for igm and igg respectively based solely on pcr-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard the assay specificities were shown to be 100% for igm and 99.2% for igg this indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection more detailed studies on antibody responses during and post infection are urgently needed article history
bats harbor many pathogens of veterinary and human health concern including several emerging and reemerging viruses such as lyssaviruses fi loviruses henipaviruses and sars-like coronaviruses despite immune responses to these viruses many bats remain infected without disease and likely shed virus to other bats and mammals little is known about bat immune systems or how the immune responses of bats control infections the recent characterization of genome and transcriptome sequences of several bat species suggests they are similar to other mammals these data indicate that bats possess orthologous genes antibodies and cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses as do other mammals but bats likely evolved unique mechanisms for controlling viruses that cause disease in other species it is unclear how these diseases affect bat ecology and thus a greater understanding of immunology and infection is needed to understand health impact on bats
live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine virus mv edmonston-zagreb ez strain was evaluated as a viral vector to express the ectodomains of fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus rsv f or glycoprotein 350 of epstein-barr virus ebv gp350 as candidate vaccines for prophylaxis of rsv and ebv the glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1 st or the 3 rd position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated insertion of the foreign gene at the 3 rd position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro rsv f or ebv gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells in cotton rats ez-rsv f and ez-ebv gp350 induced mv-and insert-specific antibody responses in addition both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma ifn- secreting t cell response ez-rsv f protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of rsv a2 challenge infection in rhesus macaques although both ez-rsv f and ez-ebv gp350 induced mv specific neutralizing antibody responses only rsv f specific antibody response was detected thus the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation
purpose antigens were conjugated on the surface of ntrimethylaminoethylmethacrylate chitosan tmc nanoparticles to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses after nasal immunization methods tmc was synthesized by free radical polymerization and blank nanoparticles were prepared by ionic crosslinking of tmc and sodium tripolyphosphate the model antigen ovalbumin was conjugated on the surface of blank nanoparticles ova-np through thioester bond formation the cellular uptake of ova-np was investigated in raw 264.7 macrophages and biodistribution of antigens was studied by the radioiodine labeling method the immunological effects were evaluated by nasal administration of ova-np to balb/c mice the transport mechanism and nasal toxicity of ova-np were studied in rats the cellular uptake of ova-np was significantly higher than that of ovalbumin-encapsulated nanoparticles npe after 30 min nasally administered ova-np showed higher transport of antigens to cervical lymph nodes with higher targeting efficiency than all other groups compared with npe ova-np induced much higher levels of systemic and mucosal immune responses in balb/c mice after three nasal immunizations ex vivo culturing of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue nalt confirmed its participation in nasal immunization the transport mechanism study revealed that ova-np can be transported across the nasal epithelium through glands and may be taken up in nalt through m cells ova-np did not induce obvious toxicity to nasal mucosa or hemolysis in animals the present study demonstrated that the conjugation of tmc nanoparticles with antigens is an effective strategy for nasal vaccination
rabies virus kills tens of thousands of people globally each year especially in resource-limited countries yet there are genetically-and antigenically-related lyssaviruses all capable of causing the disease rabies circulating globally among bats without causing conspicuous disease outbreaks the species richness and greater genetic diversity of african lyssaviruses along with the lack of antibody cross-reactivity among them has led to the hypothesis that africa is the origin of lyssaviruses this hypothesis was tested using a probabilistic phylogeographical approach the nucleoprotein gene sequences from 153 representatives of 16 lyssavirus species collected between 1956 and 2015 were used to develop a phylogenetic tree which incorporated relevant geographic and temporal data relating to the viruses in addition complete genome sequences from all 16 putative species were analysed the most probable ancestral distribution for the internal nodes was inferred using three different approaches and was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes these results support a palearctic origin for lyssaviruses posterior probability = 0.85 challenging the 'out of africa' hypothesis and suggest three independent transmission events to the afrotropical region representing the three phylogroups that form the three major lyssavirus clades rabies virus kills tens of thousands of people globally each year and causes indescribable misery and family disturbance especially in developing countries yet in much of the world there are related viruses called lyssaviruses which circulate among bats without causing conspicuous outbreaks the greater diversity of african lyssaviruses has led to the hypothesis that africa is the origin of these viruses to test this hypothesis the genetic data from 153 representative viruses from 16 available lyssavirus species from across the world dated between 1956 and 2015 were analysed statistical models were used to reconstruct the historical processes that lead to the contemporary distribution of these viruses plos neglected tropical diseases |
comparative seasonalities of influenza a b and 'common cold' coronaviruses -setting the scene for sarscov-2 infections and possible unexpected host immune interactions journal of infection 2020 doi https//doi we read with interest the recent report on the development of antibodies to sars-cov-2 . such studies provide clear evidence of seroconversion in the majority of patients hospitalized with covid-19 and kinetics of igm and igg antibody development similar to that of other respiratory virus infections while the reports provide specific antibody measurements they have not assessed possible cross reactive antibodies that have been recognised for some time .recent reports raise concerns about the possibility of vaccine-related antibody-dependent enhancement ade between the various coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 . according to these concerns there is a potential risk of enhanced pathology caused by interactions between non-neutralising antibodies binding to the spike of sars-cov-2 such antibodies could be induced by certain vaccines or -in theory-from seasonal or 'common cold' coronavirus infections -the latter of which are currently mostly relatively benign and self-limiting . whether these concerns are valid remains to be determined but it is clear that understanding the potential interactions will be important in the months and years to come
the respiratory mucosa is the primary portal of entry for numerous viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus the influenza virus and the parainfluenza virus these pathogens initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then reach the lower respiratory tract leading to diseases vaccination is an affordable way to control the pathogenicity of viruses and constitutes the strategy of choice to fight against infections including those leading to pulmonary diseases conventional vaccines based on live-attenuated pathogens present a risk of reversion to pathogenic virulence while inactivated pathogen vaccines often lead to a weak immune response subunit vaccines were developed to overcome these issues however these vaccines may suffer from a limited immunogenicity and in most cases the protection induced is only partial a new generation of vaccines based on nanoparticles has shown great potential to address most of the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines this is due to recent advances in chemical and biological engineering which allow the design of nanoparticles with a precise control over the size shape functionality and surface properties leading to enhanced antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity this short review provides an overview of the advantages associated with the use of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery platforms to immunize against respiratory viruses and highlights relevant examples demonstrating their potential as safe effective and affordable vaccines
gnotobiotic gn rodent models have provided insight into the contributions of the gut microbiota to host health and preventing disease however rodent models are limited by several important physiological and metabolic differences from humans and many rodent models do not dependably replicate the clinical manifestations of human diseases due to the high degree of similarity in anatomy physiology immunology and brain growth the domestic pig sus scrofa is considered a clinically relevant model to study factors influencing human gastrointestinal immune and brain development gnotobiotic piglet models have been developed and shown to recapitulate key aspects of gn rodent models human microbiota-associated hma piglets have been established using inocula from infants children and adults the gut microbiota of recipient hma piglets was more similar to that of the human donor than that of conventionally reared piglets harboring a pig microbiota moreover bifidobacterium and bacteroides two predominant bacterial groups of infant gut were successfully established in the hma piglets thus the hma pig model has the potential to be a valuable model for investigating how the gut microbiota composition changes in response to environmental factors such as age diet vaccination antibiotic use and infection the hma also represents a robust model for screening the efficacy of pre-and probiotic interventions lastly hma piglets can be an ideal model with which to elucidate microbe-host interactions in human health and disease due to the similarities to humans in anatomy physiology developmental maturity at birth and the pathophysiology of many human diseases
a membrane m protein-based elisa was developed to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv the m gene of pedv was expressed in escherichia coli the purified recombinant m protein was used to immunize rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the anti-pedv-m antibody reacted with pedv-infected cells the antibody was utilized to develop an indirect elisa to detect pedv other viruses porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus classic swine fever virus and porcine pseudorabies virus were unreactive
the human immunodeficiency virus type one hiv-1 is the major causing pathogen of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids a large number of hiv-1-related studies are based on three non-human model animals chimpanzee rhesus macaque and mouse however the differences in host-hiv-1 interactions between human and these model organisms have remained unexplored
plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes are important targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria but their high number and variability provide the pathogen with a powerful means of escape from host antibodies 1-4 . although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design their identification has proven elusive here we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different p falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the rifin family these antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large dna fragment between the v and dj segments
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has continued spreading since its emergence in 2012 with a mortality rate of 35.6% and is a potential pandemic threat prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem we report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles vlp expressing the receptor binding domain rbd of mers-cov in this study a fusion of the canine parvovirus cpv vp2 structural protein gene with the rbd of mers-cov can self-assemble into chimeric spherical vlp svlp svlp retained certain parvovirus characteristics such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes and structural morphology similar to cpv virions immunization with svlp induced rbd-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice svlp-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped mers-cov entry into susceptible cells with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1 320 ifn-g il-4 and il-2 secreting cells induced by the rbd were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by elispot furthermore mice inoculated with svlp or an adjuvanted svlp vaccine elicited t-helper 1 th1 and t-helper 2 th2 cell-mediated immunity our study demonstrates that svlp displaying the rbd of mers-cov are promising prophylactic candidates against mers-cov in a potential outbreak situation
background rabbits are cecotrophic hindgut-fermenters that rely heavily on their gastrointestinal microbiota for optimal digestion of plant-based diets dysbiosis caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex rec a major cause of morbidity and mortality the objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings commercial meat companion laboratory and shelter and to identify how factors such as age season and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition results a total of 86 pooled commercial meat 54 companion 14 pooled laboratory and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the v4 region in all sample types the predominant bacterial phylum was firmicutes other commonly identified phyla composing ≥ 1% of the total microbiota composition were verrucomicrobia proteobacteria and bacteroidetes significant differences in composition were noted between commercial companion laboratory and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of verrucomicrobia p < 0.01 proteobacteria p < 0.01 and lentisphaerae p = 0.01 within the total microbiota within the commercial meat rabbit samples significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers n = 42 and does n = 44 were limited to one unclassified firmicutes p = 0.03 and no differences were identified at the phylum level significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer n = 44 compared to the winter n = 42 with firmicutes p = 0.04 verrucomicrobia p = 0.03 proteobacteria p = 0.02 deinococcus-thermus p = 0.04 armatimonadates p = 0.003 and actinobacteria p = 0.03 forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota the only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified bacteroidetes p < 0.05 and no differences were identified at the phylum level conclusions rabbit husbandry and diet in addition to season significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has caused fatal infections some through hospital-acquired transmission in affected regions since its emergence in 2012 although the virus is not pandemic among humans it poses a great threat to public health due to its zoonotic origin thus both preventative and therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed in this study we discovered a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies mabs against mers-cov which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike s protein of the virus in addition to mabs with neutralizing epitopes located on the receptor-binding domain one mab 5f9 which binds to the n-terminal domain ntd of the mers-cov s1 subunit showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type mers-cov strain emc/2012 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 μg/ml we concluded that a novel neutralizing epitope for mers-cov also resides on the ntd of the s protein indicating that the ntd might be important during the viral infection process our findings have significant implications for further vaccine design and for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal immunotherapies against mers-cov infection
the enteric disease of swine recognized in the early 1970s in europe was initially described as "epidemic viral diarrhea" and is now termed "porcine epidemic diarrhea ped". the coronavirus referred to as ped virus pedv was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease in the late 1970s since then the disease has been reported in europe and asia but the most severe outbreaks have occurred predominantly in asian swine-producing countries most recently ped first emerged in early 2013 in the united states that caused high morbidity and mortality associated with ped remarkably affecting us pig production and spread further to canada and mexico soon thereafter large-scale ped epidemics recurred through the pork industry in south korea japan and taiwan these recent outbreaks and global re-emergence of ped require urgent attention and deeper understanding of pedv biology and pathogenic mechanisms this paper highlights the current knowledge of molecular epidemiology diagnosis and pathogenesis of pedv as well as prevention and control measures against pedv infection more information about the virus and the disease is still necessary for the development of effective vaccines and control strategies it is hoped that this review will stimulate further basic and applied studies and encourage collaboration among producers researchers and swine veterinarians to provide answers that improve our understanding of pedv and ped in an effort to eliminate this economically significant viral disease which emerged or re-emerged worldwide
significant concerns have arisen over the past 3 y from the increased global spread of the mosquitoborne flavivirus zika accompanying this spread has been an increase in cases of the devastating birth defect microcephaly as well as of guillain-barré syndrome in adults in many affected countries currently there is no vaccine or therapy for this infection however we sought to develop a combination approach that provides more rapid and durable protection than traditional vaccination alone a novel immune-based prophylaxis/therapy strategy entailing the facilitated delivery of a synthetic dna consensus prme vaccine along with dna-encoded anti-zikv envelope monoclonal antibodies dmab were developed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy this immediate and persistent protection strategy confers the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination or passive immunotherapy a collection of novel dmabs were developed which were potent against zikv and could be expressed in serum within 24-48 h of in vivo administration the dna vaccine from a previous development was potent after adaptive immunity was developed protecting against infection brain and testes pathology in relevant mouse challenge models and in an nhp challenge delivery of potent dmabs protected mice from the same murine viral challenge within days of delivery combined injection of dmab and the dna vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection in this challenge model providing an important demonstration of the advantage of this synergistic approach to pandemic outbreaks article history
emerging viruses pose a major threat to humans and livestock with global public health and economic burdens vaccination remains an effective tool to reduce this threat and yet the conventional cell culture often fails to produce sufficient vaccine dose as an alternative to cell-culture based vaccine virus-like particles vlps are considered as a highpriority vaccine strategy against emerging viruses vlps represent highly ordered repetitive structures via macromolecular assemblies of viral proteins the particulate nature allows efficient uptake into antigen presenting cells stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses towards enhanced vaccine efficacy increasing research activity and translation opportunity necessitate the advances in the design of vlps and new bioprocessing modalities for efficient and cost-effective production herein we describe major achievements and challenges in this endeavor with respect to designing strategies to harnessing the immunogenic potential production platforms downstream processes and some exemplary cases in developing vlp-based vaccines
it has been shown that a single parenteral administration of vaccine containing bacterial ligands for tlr1 tlr2 tlr4 tlr6 and tlr9 in mice induced rapid 24 h after administration and effective 100% but short-term 96 h protection against lethal challenge with salmonella typhimurium repeated mucosal applications of this vaccine stimulated longterm up to 9 months protection against acute respiratory infections in children of pre-

background the iberian lynx lynx pardinus is considered the most endangered felid species in the world in order to save this species the spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild in this context a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated
methods we took sera from animals in the middle east oman and from elsewhere spain netherlands chile cattle n=80 sheep n=40 goats n=40 dromedary camels n=155 and various other camelid species n=34 were tested for specifi c serum igg by protein microarray using the receptor-binding s1 subunits of spike proteins offindings 50 of 50 100% sera from omani camels and 15 of 105 14% from spanish camels had protein-specifi c antibodies against mers-cov spike sera from european sheep goats cattle and other camelids had no such antibodies mers-cov neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the spanish camel sera there was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies interpretation mers-cov or a related virus has infected camel populations both titres and seroprevalences in sera from diff erent locations in oman suggest widespread infection
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is an enteric disease in swine caused by an alphacoronavirus it affects swine of all ages causing acute diarrhoea and can lead to severe dehydration and death in suckling piglets being recognized for the first time in europe and asia during the seventies and the eighties respectively it has remained a relevant cause of diarrhea outbreaks in asia for years and to the present it has become a major concern in swine production since 2013 when the virus was detected for first time in the usa and in other american countries causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic losses the present review aims at approaching the reader to the state of the art of ped giving answer to some of the most recent questions which have arisen related to this disease
the aim of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of coccidian infections in suckling piglets and sows in poland the research was carried out in 14 out of 16 polish provinces in the years 2003-2005 the investigation was conducted on three types of farms large farms >100 sows medium farms 25-100 sows and small farms <25 sows diarrhoea of unweaned piglets was observed on all the examined farms overall 780 litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined the faeces were analyzed with the modified mcmaster method isopsora suis was found in 217 27.8% litters from 70 66.7% farms eimeria spp was detected only in 20 2.6% litters from 12 11.5% farms on the large farms i suis infection was detected in 31.7% of litters whereas eimeria spp in 1.4% of them on the medium sized farms i suis was found in 18.1% of litters and eimeria spp in 0.6%. on the small farms i suis was detected in only 13.2% of litters whereas eimeria spp in as many as 28.9%. i suis and eimeria spp oocysts were found in 18 6.7% and 16 6% sows respectively from 72 sows producing i suis infected piglets only 12 16.7% shed i suis oocysts and as little as 4 5.6% shed eimeria oocysts in the remaining 56 sows 77.8% no cases of coccidian infections were detected the results of this investigation demonstrate the high prevalence of i suis in suckling piglets on the large swine farms in poland #
bats and rodents are being increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic viruses various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical regions but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential that circulate in bat and rat populations in viet nam to address this paucity of data we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the mekong delta region of southern viet nam faecal and urine samples were screened for the presence of rna from paramyxoviruses coronaviruses and filoviruses paramyxovirus rna was detected in 4 of 248 1% and 11 of 222 4.9% bat faecal and urine samples respectively coronavirus rna was detected in 55 of 248 22% of bat faecal samples filovirus rna was not detected in any of the bat samples further coronavirus rna was detected in 12 of 270 4.4% of rat faecal samples all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and rat coronaviruses were related to viruses circulating in bat and rodent populations globally but showed no cross-species mixing of viruses between bat and rat populations within viet nam our study shows that potentially novel variants of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses commonly circulate in bat and rat populations in viet nam further characterization of the viruses and additional human and animal surveillance is required to evaluate the likelihood of viral spillover and to assess whether these viruses pose a risk to human health bats coronavirus paramyxovirus rats viet nam zoonotic viruses *vizions consortium group members are present in appendix 1 this is an open access article under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited
background coccidiosis due to eimeria spp infections in lambs causes increased mortality and substantial production losses and anticoccidials are important for control of the infection anticoccidial resistance has been reported in poultry and swine and we recently described reduced toltrazuril efficacy in ovine eimeria spp in some norwegian sheep farms using a newly developed faecal oocyst count reduction test focrt the aim of the present study was to use a controlled efficacy trial to assess the efficacy of toltrazuril against a field isolate suspected of being resistant methods twenty lambs 17-22 days old and raised protected against exposure to coccidia were infected with a field isolate of 100000 eimeria spp oocysts this isolate was obtained from a farm with a previously calculated drug efficacy of 56% 95% confidence interval -433.9 to 96.6%. at day 7 post-infection 10 of the lambs were orally treated with 20 mg/kg toltrazuril baycox sheep vet bayer animal health while the other 10 lambs controls were given physiological saline clinical examinations were conducted and weight gains recorded daily faecal samples were scored for diarrhoea on a scale from 1 to 5 and oocyst excretion was determined using a modified mcmaster technique oocysts were morphologically identified to species level at 17-24 days post-infection the lambs were euthanized and necropsied results the tested eimeria isolate was resistant against toltrazuril and resistance was seen in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species in addition no significant differences in faecal score growth gross pathology or histological changes were identified between the two groups the pathogenic e ovinoidalis was the dominant species and no significant difference in the individual prevalence of e ovinoidalis post-treatment was found between treated 66.9% and control lambs 61.9%. other species identified included e crandallis/weybridgensis e parva e marsica e faurei e pallida e ahsata and e bakuensis conclusions this study confirms toltrazuril resistance in ovine eimeria spp in addition the data support the use of focrt as an appropriate tool for field evaluation of anticoccidial efficacy due to limited anticoccidial treatment alternatives these findings may have important implications for the sheep industry particularly in northern europe
influenza a h7n9 virus has caused five outbreak waves of human infections in china since 2013 and posed a dual challenge to public health and poultry industry there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to reduce its pandemic potential in the present study we evaluated the biochemical characteristics and immunogenicity of two h7 virus-like particles vlps composed of the matrix 1 m1 and hemagglutinin of wild-type ha-wt or hemagglutinin of whose transmembrane domain replaced by that from h3n2 subtype ha-tm h7 vlps-wt and h7 vlps-tm could assemble and release into the supernatant of sf9 cells and they had similar morphological characteristics however compared to h7 vlps-wt h7 vlps-tm had more trimeric ha proteins and could better resist thermal changes in mice h7 vlps-tm induced higher titers of hi igg igg2a and ifn-c and provided better protection against homologous and heterologous h7n9 viruses no matter belonging to yangtze river delta or pearl river delta challenge with less weight loss and higher survival rate in summary h7 vlps-tm represents a potential strategy for the development of h7n9 vaccines
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov was first identified in hong kong in 2009-2010 and reported in united states swine for the first time in february 2014 however diagnostic tools other than polymerase chain reaction for pdcov detection were lacking and koch's postulates had not been fulfilled to confirm the pathogenic potential of pdcov in the present study pdcov peptide-specific rabbit antisera were developed and used in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to assist pdcov diagnostics the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of pdcov was investigated following orogastric inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with a plaque-purified pdcov cell culture isolate 3 â 10 4 tcid 50 per pig the pdcov-inoculated piglets developed mild to moderate diarrhea shed increasing amount of virus in rectal swabs from 2 to 7 days post inoculation and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining this study experimentally confirmed pdcov pathogenicity and characterized pdcov pathogenesis in neonatal piglets
infection of cell monolayers by murine coronavirus a59 at ph 6 rather than 7 yielded a ten-fold increase in the infectious titer and a remarkable enhancement of the reactivities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the spike glycoprotein in immunoblotting immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays these observations are very useful for detecting antibodies against the s glycoprotein of coronaviruses and enhancing infectious titers
a comparative study was carried out to investigate the correlation between the antiviral effect induced in macrophages by ifn gamma and the resistance of a/j and balb/c mice to an experimental infection of mhv 3 mhv 4 and mhva 59 both mouse strains were resistant to intraperitoneal infection with mhv 4 or mhva 59 and only the a/j mice showed resistance to mhv 3 the balb/c mice being fully susceptible to this virus infection comparable growth kinetics for all three viruses were observed in both mouse strains except for the mhv 3 growth in balb/c mice where the virus titre increased to a peak on day 2 remaining high until day 4 when the mice died of acute hepatitis the ifn gamma titres in the peritoneum of mice preceded and correlated with the virus growth higher titres being found in mhv 3 infected balb/c mice the highest titre was always observed 24 to 48 h after infection among viral strains grown in cultured macrophages higher titres were always observed in cultures infected with mhva 59 followed by mhv 3 and the lowest those infected with mhv 4 the macrophage activation by ifn gamma-induced a partial restriction of virus growth only in mhv 3 infected a/j mouse macrophages a virus specificity of the ifn gamma-induced antiviral state was shown to be in direct correlation with the resistance of mice to mhv 3 infection
a case-control study of calves under 3 months of age was carried out by weekly visits to 15 farms in the canton of tilar&r costa rica most farms were dedicated to beef or dual-purpose dp production faecal samples were collected over a 6-month period from a total of 194 calves with clinical signs and from 186 animals without clinical signs of diarrhoea as assessed by a scoring system the samples were investigated for the presence of viruses bacteria and parasites torovirus was detected for the first time in costa rica and was present in 14% of calves with diarrhoea and in 6% of the controls coronavirus and rotavirus were less frequently encountered in either one of the groups in 9 and 7% of scouring calves and in 1 and 2% of controls respectively escherichiu coli was detected in 94% of all the faecal samples but isolates from only three samples from calves with diarrhoea contained the k99 antigen similarly salmonella was found only in scouring calves cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in animals with signs of diarrhoea while other coccidia oocysts strongylida and strongyloides eggs were frequently found i-n animals both with and without diarrhoea a conditional logistic regression clr analysis to compare healthy and scouring calves showed a significant difference with regard to the presence of torovirus rotavirus and coronavirus 0 1998 elsevier science b v
background porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 is associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws an emerging swine disease that causes progressive weight loss dyspnea tachypnea anemia jaundice and diarrhea in piglets although baculovirus is an enveloped virus that infects insects in nature it has emerged as a vaccine vector and we used it to develop a novel candidate vaccine for a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control pcv2 infections methods immunoblotting analysis of recombinant baculovirus and immunofluorescent staining of baculovirus-infected cells were followed using anti-orf2 monoclonal antibodies the balb/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with this baculovirus the titers of antibodies were mensurated with a cap-protein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and a serum neutralization assay the ifn-γ response in splenocytes harvested from immunized mice was measured by elisa student's t-test was used to compare immune responses of different groups results in this study we successfully constructed a dual-expression-system-based recombinant baculovirus bv-gd-orf2 which can display the pcv2 capsid cap protein and vsv-g protein on the viral envelope and also expressing cap protein on transduced mammalian cells thereby functioning as both a subunit and a dna vaccine after infection the cap protein was expressed and displayed on the viral surface as demonstrated with an indirect fluorescence assay and immunoblotting the vaccination of mice with recombinant baculovirus bv-gd-orf2 successfully induced robust cap-protein-specific humoral and cellular immune responses conclusions our findings collectively demonstrate that the recombinant baculovirus bv-gd-orf2 is a potential vaccine against pcv2 infections
monoclonal antibodies mabs against two major structural proteins of the cell-adapted mebus strain of bovine coronavirus bcv-l9 were produced and characterized seven mabs reacted with the peplomeric glycoprotein gploo/s while three mabs reacted with the nucleoprotein p53/n in western blot analysis of bcv polypeptides mabs to gploo/s reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gploo/s in westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions in contrast mabs to p53/n reacted in both types of westerns and those epitopes were thus continuous mabs to p53/n failed to neutralize bcv infectivity while 4 mabs to gploo/s neutralized bcv effectively cross reactivity of mabs to gploo/s specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage cell-culture-adapted strains in mildly denaturing westerns and neutralization assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild-type strains non-neutralizing mabs of gploo/s reacted with all seven strains in westerns with the exception of one mab that was specific for the highly cell-adapted strain bcv-l9
persistent human papillomavirus hpv type 16 and 18 infection can lead to pre-malignant and malignant diseases of the lower genital tract several lines of evidence suggest that t cell responses can control hpv infection however relative to other human viruses strong effector memory t cell responses against hpv have been difficult to detect we used an in vitro stimulation step prior to enzyme-linked immunospot assays to identify ifn-c-secreting t cells specific for hpv16 and 18 e6/e7 peptides this allowed the detection of hpv-specific cd4 1 t cells that were not evident in direct ex vivo assays t cell responses against hpv16 or 18 peptides were detected in healthy volunteers 7/9 and patients with lower genital tract neoplasia 10/20 importantly this assay allowed tracking of vaccine-induced t cell responses in nine patients following inoculation with a live recombinant vaccinia virus hpv16 and 18 e6/e7 ta-hpv novel vaccine-induced t cell responses were demonstrated in five patients but no clinical responses lesion regressions were seen for one vaccinated patient the t cell response was mapped to a single dominant hpv18 e7 epitope and this response was sustained for >3 years our data suggest that systemic memory t cells against hpv16 and 18 induced naturally or by ta-hpv vaccination are relatively rare nevertheless the assay system developed allowed estimation of magnitude epitope specificity and longevity of vaccine-induced cd4 1 t cell responses this will be useful for vaccine design and measurement of immunological endpoints in clinical trials

next-generation sequencing ngs has the potential to transform the discovery of viruses causing unexplained acute febrile illness uafi because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence more generally it has the potential to elucidate the complete human virome including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences we have used ngs to identify rna viruses in the blood of 195 patients with uafi and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy i e no overt signs of illness control individuals all from communities in southeastern nigeria among uafi patients we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses such as hiv-1 hepatitis and lassa virus in our cohort of healthy individuals however we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses these viruses which we call ekpoma virus-1 ekv-1 and ekpoma virus-2 ekv-2 are highly divergent with little identity to each other or other known viruses the most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus tibrovirus and bas-congo virus basv which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever furthermore by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort we find evidence for plos neglected tropical diseases | next-generation sequencing a high-throughput method for sequencing dna and rna has the potential to transform virus discovery because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence we used nextgeneration sequencing to identify rna viruses present in the blood of patients with unexplained fever as well as apparently healthy individuals in a peri-urban community in nigeria we found several well-characterized viruses in the blood of the febrile patients including hiv-1 hepatitis b and c as well as lassa virus we also discovered two novel rhabdoviruses in the blood of two apparently healthy afebrile females which we named ekpoma virus-1 and ekpoma virus-2 rhabdoviruses are distributed globally and include several human pathogens from the genera lyssavirus and vesiculovirus e g rabies chandipura and vesicular stomatitis virus the novel rhabdoviruses identified in this study are most similar to bas-congo virus which was recently identified in an individual with an acute febrile illness furthermore we demonstrate evidence of high levels of previous exposure to the two rhabdoviruses among our larger study population our results suggest that such rhabdovirus infections could be common and may not necessarily cause overt disease the identification of viral nucleic acid sequences in apparently healthy individuals highlights the need for a broader understanding of all viruses infecting humans as we increase efforts to identify viruses causing human disease
cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic agent that infects humans and animals occasionally causing severe watery diarrhoea in immunocompetent hosts cryptosporidiosis is selflimiting but can have a fatal outcome in immunocompromised individuals cryptosporidium is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases recreational water and drinking water in humans a leading cause of moderate to severe childhood diarrhoea and a major agent of diarrhoea in calves leading to high economic losses and up to 10 % lethality so far available treatment options are insufficient for both veterinary and human clinical disease cases here we report for the first time that the novel bumped kinase inhibitor bki 1294 targeting the calciumdependent protein kinase 1 cdpk1 of cryptosporidium is able to reduce the oocyst shedding of c parvum by calves-its natural host-without obvious side effects
rabbit hemorrhagic disease which is caused by a calicivirus is a lethal infection of adult animals that is characterized by acute liver damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation in this study we report the production of the major structural protein vp60 of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus in transgenic tubers of potato plants and its use as an oral immunogen in rabbits
parasite-driven declines in wildlife have become increasingly common and can pose significant risks to natural populations we used the iucn red list of threatened and endangered species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions the majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species including domesticated animals counter to our predictions parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals in addition our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite-mediated declines thus efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk
sera from 38 free-ranging spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta in the serengeti ecosystem tanzania were screened for exposure to coronavirus of antigenic group 1 an immunofluorescence assay indicated high levels of exposure to coronavirus among serengeti hyenas 95% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥110 and 74% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥140 cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults exposure among serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an elisa application of rt-pcr to 27 fecal samples revealed viral rna in three samples 11%. all three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals <24 months of age sampled and none from the 12 adults sampled no viral rna was detected in tissue samples lymph node intestine lung from 11 individuals sequencing of two amplified products from the s protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific rna with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type ii of 80 and 84% respectively estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in european american and japanese domestic cats and dogs from long-term observations of several hundred known individuals the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea there was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas to our knowledge this is the first report of coronavirus infection in hyaenidae
naturally-occurring attenuated strains of newcastle disease virus ndv are being developed as vaccine vectors for use in poultry and humans however some ndv strains such as beaudette c bc may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic we therefore modified the bc strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the f protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain lasota additionally the bc f and hn proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication these modified bc-derived vectors and the lasota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin ha protein of h5n1 highly pathogenic influenza virus hpaiv in general the modified bc-based vectors expressing ha replicated better than lasota/ha and expressed higher levels of ha protein pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens based on in vitro characterization two of the modified bc vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against h5n1 hpaiv a/vietnam/1203/04 immunization of chickens with rndv vector vaccines followed by challenge with hpaiv demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality however only those chickens immunized with modified bc/ha in which residues 271-330 from the f protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the ndv ako strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding our findings suggest that this modified rndv can be used safely as a vaccine vector with enhanced replication expression and protective efficacy in avian species and potentially in humans newcastle disease virus vectored vaccine hemagglutinin h5n1 highly virulent avian influenza virus
bovine coronavirus bcov is a viral enteric pathogen associated with calf diarrhea worldwide being in argentina mostly detected in dairy husbandry systems the aim of the present work was to study if maternal igg1 antibodies abs to bcov acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of bcov infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in argentina thirty holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial bcov igg1 ab titers the ''failure of passive transfer'' fpt group had significantly lower igg1 abs to bcov than the ''acceptable passive transfer'' apt group of calves log10 1.98 vs 3.38 respectively p < 0.0001 these differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared p = 0.0081 moreover 71% 5/7 of calves from the fpt group showed igg1 seroconversion to bcov compared to 29.4% 5/17 of animals from the apt group regarding viral circulation bcov was detected in 10% 3/30 of all calves and bcov igg1 ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with bcov in conclusion calves with high titers of specific bcov igg1 ≥1024 were mostly protected against viral infection while animals with low titers of igg1 <1024 were mostly infected with bcov igg1 abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of bcov infection by-nc-nd license http//creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/. mostró con respecto a la circulación viral se detectó bcov en el 10% 3/30 de los terneros así como también seroconversión de igg1 en el 42% del total de los animales lo que evidencia que aproximadamente la mitad de los terneros se infectaron con bcov este estudio mostró que los terneros con altos títulos de igg1 específica ≥ 1.024 estuvieron mayormente protegidos contra la infección con bcov mientras que los animales con títulos bajos de igg1 < 1.024 estuvieron predispuestos a la infección esto confirma que los anticuerpos igg1 calostrales son críticos para la prevención de la infección por este agente viral
in march 2013 a patient infected with a novel avian influenza a h7n9 virus was reported in china since then there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths the virus contains several human-adapted markers indicating that h7n9 has pandemic potential the outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines previously we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain m2e of the h5n1 virus h5n1-m2e could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of h5n1 and 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses in this study we investigated the cross-protection of h5n1-m2e against lethal infection with the new h7n9 virus although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13 14 18 20 and 21 between m2e of h5n1 and h7n9 h5n1-m2e vaccination with either freund's adjuvant or the sigma adjuvant system sas induced a high level of anti-m2e antibody which cross-reacted with h7n9-m2e peptide a mouse-adapted h7n9 strain a/anhui/01/2013m was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments h5n1-m2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the h7n9 virus reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice our results suggest that the tetrameric h5n1-m2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections therefore this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza a h7n9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus
heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspg are composed of unbranched negatively charged heparan sulfate hs polysaccharides attached to a variety of cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins widely expressed they mediate many biological activities including angiogenesis blood coagulation developmental processes and cell homeostasis hspg are highly sulfated and broadly used by a range of pathogens especially viruses to attach to the cell surface in this review we summarize the current knowledge on hspg-virus interactions and distinguish viruses with established hs binding viruses that bind hs only after intra-host or cell culture adaptation and finally viruses whose dependence on hs for infection is debated we also provide an overview of the antiviral compounds designed to interfere with hs binding many questions remain about the true importance of these receptors in vivo knowledge that is critical for the design of future antiviral therapies herpes simplex virus cytomegalovirus human herpes virus-8 kaposi sarcoma herpes virus foot and mouth disease virus john cunningham polyomavirus respiratory syncytial virus dengue virus pseudorabies virus human papillomavirus venezuelan equine encephalitis virus enterovirus 71 parainfluenza virus 3 echovirus 5 merkel cell polyomavirus hepatitis c virus sindbis virus human metapneumovirus echovirus 6 hepatitis b virus/hepatitis delta virus adeno-associated virus 2 semliki forest virus zika virus north american eastern equine encephalitis virus vaccinia virus human immunodeficiency virus rhinovirus c15 adenovirus 5 adenovirus 2 filoviruses rhinovirus 8 coronavirus nl63 norovirus genogroup ii akabane virus rhinovirus 89 schmallenberg virus rift valley fever virus coxsackie virus b3 rabies virus rhinovirus 54 yellow fever virus swine vesicular disease virus enterovirus 71 japanese encephalitis virus theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus coxsackie virus a9 west nile virus human parechovirus 1 hendra and nipah viruses tick-borne encephalitis virus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus human t cell leukemia virus type 1 coronavirus group 1 porcine circovirus 2 hepatitis e virus coronavirus oc43 chikungunya virus murray valley encephalitis virus viruses in bold are discussed in detail in the following sections
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv can cause serious disease and even death in neonatal piglets resulting in serious damage to the swine industry worldwide open reading frame 3 orf3 is the only accessory gene in the pedv genome previous studies have indicated that pedv vaccine strains have a partial deletion in orf3 in this study a nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction nanoparticle-assisted rt-pcr assay targeting the orf3 of pedv was developed to distinguish pedv field strains from attenuated strains by using a specific pair of primers the pcr products of field strains and attenuated strains were 264 bp and 215 bp in length respectively the sensitivity and specificity of this assay were also assessed the nanoparticle-assisted rt-pcr assay was 10-100 times more sensitive than the conventional rt-pcr assay with no cross-reactions when amplifying porcine pseudorabies virus prv porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 classical swine fever virus csfv porcine parvovirus ppv porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv porcine rotavirus rv and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev the nanoparticle-assisted rt-pcr assay we describe here can be used to distinguish field strains from vaccine strains of pedv and it shows promise for reducing economic loss due to pedv infection
the covid-19 disease is one of worst pandemics to sweep the globe in recent times it is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly herein we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination specifically against measles mumps and rubella mmr to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over sars-cov-2 we identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of sars-cov-2 and measles and mumps viruses moreover we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the macro adp-ribose-1''-phosphatase domains of sars-cov-2 and rubella virus the rubella macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in mmr hence we hypothesize that mmr could protect against poor outcome in covid-19 infection as an initial test of this hypothesis we identified that 1 age groups that most likely lack of mmr vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in covid-19 and 2 covid-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres potentially induced by sars-cov2 homologous sequences we therefore propose that vaccination of 'at risk' age groups with an mmr vaccination merits further consideration as a time appropriate and safe intervention
influenza strains produced by recombination and tested as possible live vaccine candidates were studied in organ cultures of trachea two strains which proved to be too virulent in human volunteers regularly caused damage to the ciliated epithelium and viruses grew to high titre two strains which proved to be attenuated for volunteers did not cause appreciable damage although they replicated to low titre in the epithelium similar results were obtained with influenza a virus attenuated by passage in the presence of horse sera the method may be of value for detecting virulent live influenza vaccine candidates without risking severe illness in volunteers arch ges virusforsch 43/4 25
epidermal growth factor egf promotes gastrointestinal mucosal recovery by stimulating the mitogenic activity of intestinal crypt epithelial cells the aim of this study was to determine the effects of egf on atrophic enteritis induced in piglets by experimental infection with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv strain dr13 two groups of 12 conventional colostrum-deprived 1-day-old large white-duroc cross breed piglets were inoculated orally with pedv 3 · 10 5 50% tissue culture infective doses with or without egf 10 lg/kg/day intraperitoneally once daily for 4 days after infection and compared to 12 uninfected untreated control piglets pedv + egf piglets had less severe clinical signs than pedv only piglets at 48 and 60 h post-infection hpi histologically the ratio of villous heightcrypt depth of pedv + egf piglets was significantly higher than pedv only piglets at 36 and 48 hpi immunohistochemistry for ki67 demonstrated increased proliferation in intestinal crypt epithelial cells of pedv + egf piglets compared to pedv only piglets at 36 48 and 60 hpi egf stimulates proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells and promotes recovery from atrophic enteritis in pedv-infected piglets
an unexplained outbreak of feline diarrhea and vomiting negative for common 25 enteric viral and bacterial pathogens was subjected to viral metagenomics and pcr we 26 characterized from fecal samples the genome of a novel chapparvovirus we named fechavirus 27 that was shed by 8/17 affected cats and different feline bocaviruses shed by 9/17 cats also 28 detected were nucleic acids from attenuated vaccine viruses members of the normal feline 29 virome viruses found in only one or two cases and viruses likely derived from ingested food 30 products epidemiological investigation of disease signs time of onset and transfers of affected 31 cats between three facilities support a possible role for this new chapparvovirus in a highly 32 contagious feline diarrhea and vomiting disease 33 34 35
noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide with gii.4 strains accounting for 80% of infections the major capsid protein of gii.4 strains is evolving rapidly resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials to test if antigenic drift may contribute to gii.4 persistence human memory b cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies mabs characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered gii.4 virus-like particles vlps reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer human anti-gii.4 mabs grouped into three vlp reactivity patterns ancestral reacted exclusively to the earliest gii.4 vlps by eia and blockade nvb 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary gii.4 vlps while nbv 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the gii.4.2006 minerva strain three mabs had broad gii.4 reactivity two nvb 37.10 and 61.3 also detected other genogroup ii vlps by eia but did not block any vlp interactions with carbohydrate ligands nvb 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered gii.4 vlps as measured by vlpcarbohydrate blockade assays using mutant vlps designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes two evolving gii.4specific blockade epitopes were mapped amino acids 294-298 and 368-372 were required for binding nvb 114 111 and 43.9 mabs amino acids 393-395 were essential for binding nvb 97 supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation these data inform vlp vaccine design provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric vlp vaccines and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease moreover these data support the hypothesis that gii.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently antibody-driven receptor switching thus protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution
vaccination plays a vital role in controlling diseases caused by chicken infectious bronchitis virus ibv the continuously variant antigenicity of ibv limits the application of current vaccine strategies and serological diagnostic systems s2 protein is an invariant that harbors broad neutralizing epitopes however little is known about the key amino acids that contribute to the broad-spectrum s2 epitopes in this study we aimed to elucidate the specific amino acids contributing to s2 epitopes site mutagenesis and peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas showed that 16r in s2 protein was a key amino acid mediating the antigenicity of s2 protein s2-derived peptides with 16r but not those with 16 k could react with sera against different types of ibvs notably a commercial elisa kit for detection of antibodies against ibv did not react with sera against all types of ibvs taken together these data demonstrated that s2-derived peptides with 16r could be used as novel marker-based antigens for developing both broad-spectrum vaccines and serological diagnostic kits to control ibv
the ability of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv to establish a persistent infection is the principal contributing factor to the world-wide spread of the disease several studies have documented the course of viral infection in postnatally infected pigs however very little is known regarding sites of virus replication during persistent infection of pigs exposed to prrsv in utero in this study virus replication and prrsv-specific antibody were followed for several hundred days in a group of pigs derived from three sows infected at 90 days of gestation with prrsv isolate vr-2332 eighty-four percent of pigs were born viremic with a mortality of 54% within 21 days after birth at approximately 60 days sera from pigs were negative for virus by virus isolation analysis of virus replication in the tissues of pigs randomly sacrificed between 63 and 132 days showed no evidence of virus in lung and other non-lymphoid organs however virus was easily recovered from tonsil and lymph nodes and in situ hybridization identified these tissues as sites of virus replication even though replication was at a low level virus was easily transmitted to sentinel pigs by 260 days pigs became seronegative and did not transmit virus to sentinel pigs sacrifice of remaining pigs after 300 days showed no evidence of virus in blood and tissues this study shows that congenital prrsv-infected pigs can support virus replication for an
infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a highly contagious respiratory coronavirus of domestic chickens although mortality is low infection with ibv results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries despite the economic importance of ibv and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection significant gaps in our knowledge exist the aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain the air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions however the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus ibv spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac these preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for ibv tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of ibv infection

flavonoids are natural biomolecules that are known to be effective antivirals these biomolecules can act at different stages of viral infection particularly at the molecular level to inhibit viral growth enterovirus a71 ev-a71 a non-enveloped rna virus is one of the causative agents of hand foot and mouth disease hfmd which is prevalent in asia despite much effort no clinically approved antiviral treatment is available for children suffering from hfmd flavonoids from plants serve as a vast reservoir of therapeutically active constituents that have been explored as potential antiviral candidates against rna and dna viruses here we reviewed flavonoids as evidence-based natural sources of antivirals against non-picornaviruses and picornaviruses the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of ev-a71 infections are discussed
type 1 diabetes t1d is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mounts an attack on the host's insulinproducing cells because most cases of t1d cannot be attributed only to individual genetics it is strongly inferred that there is a significant environmental contribution such as infection impacting disease development the human enteroviruses hev are common picornaviruses often implicated as triggers of human t1d although precisely which of the numerous hev may be involved in human t1d development is unknown experiments using non-obese diabetic nod mice commonly used to model t1d show that induction of t1d by hev infection in nod mice is a multifactorial process involving both the virus and the host interestingly results demonstrate that hev infection of nod mice can also induce long-term protection from t1d under certain conditions suggesting that a similar mechanism may occur in humans based upon both experimental animal and observational human studies we postulate that hev have a dual role in t1d development and can either cause or prevent autoimmune disease whichever outcome occurs depends upon multiple variables in the host-virus equation many of which can be deduced from results obtained from nod mouse studies we propose that the background to the sharply rising t1d incidences observed in the 20th century correlates with increased levels of hygiene in human societies viewing t1d in this perspective suggests that potential preventative options could be developed
metabarcoding diet analysis has become a valuable tool in animal ecology however co-amplified predator sequences are not generally used for anything other than to validate predator identity exemplified by the common vampire bat we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments growing populations of common vampire bats impact human livestock and wildlife health in latin america through transmission of pathogens such as lethal rabies viruses techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality-and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks however previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications using bloodmeal and faecal chiroptera phyllostomidae desmodontinae greenhall et al 1983 .---
| zoonotic viruses that emerge from wildlife and domesticated animals pose a serious threat to human and animal health in many instances mouse models have improved our understanding of the human immune response to infection however when dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases they may be of limited use this is particularly the case when the model fails to reproduce the disease status that is seen in the natural reservoir transmission species or human host in this review we discuss how researchers are placing more emphasis on the study of the immune response to zoonotic infections in the natural reservoir hosts and spillover species such studies will not only lead to a greater understanding of how these infections induce variable disease and immune responses in distinct species but also offer important insights into the evolution of mammalian immune systems
one-sentence summary of the conclusion 33 we show that the ruminant-associated influenza d virus has direct transmission capability to 34 humans 35 36 37 influenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often 38 severe consequences for both animal and human health in 2011 a novel member of the 39 orthomyxoviridae family influenza d virus idv was identified in the respiratory tract of 40 diseased swine epidemiological surveys revealed that idv is distributed worldwide among 41 livestock and that idv-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure 42 to livestock to identify the transmission capability of idv to humans we determined the 43 viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of 44 humans the inoculation of idv revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny 45 virus release at different body temperatures intriguingly the replication characteristics of 46 idv revealed many similarities to the human-associated influenza c virus including the cell 47 tropism preference for ciliated cells collectively these results might indicate why idv-48 directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.49 50

occurrence of influenza pandemics is a worldwide phenomenon and a significant cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the globe it is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains therefore the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains moreover the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain therefore a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics in this review we have addressed this problem and reviewed the published studies on ascorbic acid in the common cold and influenza and laboratory studies on the effect of ascorbic acid on influenza virus we have also correlated the clinical and laboratory studies and developed a hypothesis to prevent influenza pandemics ó
seoul virus seov is a zoonotic orthohantavirus carried by black and brown rats and can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans human cases of seov virus infection have most recently been reported in the usa united kingdom france and the netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection little is known about the cell tropism of seov in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature here we report the histopathological analysis of seov cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles all adult rats in this study were positive for seov specific antibodies and viral rna in their tissues one juvenile rat was seropositive but negative in the rrt-pcr of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested seov rna was detected in all lungs followed by kidney 79% and liver 74%. histopathologic changes associated with seov infection were primarily found in the liver consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis in conclusion natural seov infection results in mild inflammation of the liver in the absence of clinical disease
in order to investigate the ability of an oil adjuvanted vaccine containing bovine coronavirus antigen to enhance lactogenic immunity in the calf pregnant cows and heifers were vaccinated and speci®c virus neutralising antibody levels determined in serum colostrum and milk pre-existing antibody titres as a result of natural infection in the serum of these animals were found to be signi®cantly increased as a result of a single shot vaccination carried out between 2 and 12 weeks before calving this was re¯ected in a similar increase in the titre and duration of speci®c antibody in milk and colostrum that was passed on to the calves the overall response observed was highly dependent on an adequate antigen payload being incorporated within the single dose vaccine no abnormal local or systemic reactions were observed as a result of vaccination it is hoped that this approach will lead to the production of a superior commercial vaccine for the protection of neonatal calves against enteric coronavirus infection 7
viruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality around the world determining the minimum dose of virus particles that can initiate infection termed the minimum infective dose mid is important for the development of risk assessment models in the fields of food and water treatment and the implementation of appropriate infection control strategies in healthcare settings both respiratory and enteric viruses can be shed at high titers from infected individuals even when the infection is asymptomatic presence of pre-existing antibodies has been shown to affect the infectious dose and to be protective against reinfection for many but not all viruses most respiratory viruses appear to be as infective in humans as in tissue culture doses of \1 tcid 50 of influenza virus rhinovirus and adenovirus were reported to infect 50% of the tested population similarly low doses of the enteric viruses norovirus rotavirus echovirus poliovirus and hepatitis a virus caused infection in at least some of the volunteers tested a number of factors may influence viruses' infectivity in experimentally infected human volunteers these include host and pathogen factors as well as the experimental methodology as a result the reported infective doses of human viruses have to be interpreted with caution

current hemagglutinin ha-based seasonal influenza vaccines induce vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that usually fail to provide protection against mismatched circulating viruses inclusion in the vaccine of highly conserved internal proteins such as the nucleoprotein np and the matrix protein 1 m1 was shown previously to increase vaccine efficacy by eliciting cross-reactive t-cells however appropriate delivery systems are required for efficient priming of t-cell responses in this study we demonstrated that administration of novel self-amplifying mrna sam 1 vectors expressing influenza np sam np m1 samm1 and np and m1 samm1-np delivered with lipid nanoparticles lnp induced robust polyfunctional cd4 t helper 1 cells while np-containing sam also induced cytotoxic cd8 t cells robust expansions of central memory t cm and effector memory t em cd4 and cd8 t cells were also measured an enhanced recruitment of npspecific cytotoxic cd8 t cells was observed in the lungs of samnp-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge finally we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of rna samm1-np and protein monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine miiv was feasible induced simultaneously np- m1-and ha-specific t cells and ha-specific neutralizing antibodies and enhanced miiv efficacy against a heterologous challenge in conclusion systemic administration of sam vectors expressing conserved internal influenza antigens induced protective immune responses in mice supporting the sam 1 platform as another promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines
a putative protective protein from plasmodium falciparum merozoites msa2 was expressed in two different ways on the cell surface of the gram-positive food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis the first display format exploits an lpxtg-type anchoring motif of the lactococcal proteinase prtp to covalently anchor msa2 to the genetically modified producer cells in a second display format msa2 was fused to the peptidoglycan-binding domain protein anchor of the lactococcal cell wall hydrolase acma and was non-covalently rebound to the surface of non-genetically modified non-living high-binder l lactis cells termed gram-positive enhancer matrix gem particles the l lactis recombinants carrying covalently bound msa2 were used to immunise rabbits through nasal and oral routes the highest levels of igg antibodies reacting with near-native msa2 on merozoites was elicited by oral administration intestinal antibodies to msa2 were produced only after oral immunisation msa2-specific t h -cell activation could be demonstrated based on these results the immunogenicity in oral immunisations of msa2 bound non-covalently to non-genetically modified l lactis gem particles was compared with msa2 that was bound covalently to genetically modified l lactis these two forms elicited similar titres of serum antibodies the results illustrate the potential of using non-genetically modified l lactis as a safe vaccine delivery vehicle to elicit systemic antibodies thereby avoiding the dissemination of recombinant dna into the environment

mammalian orthoreoviruses 3 mrv3 have been described in diarrheic pigs from usa and asia we firstly detected mrv3 in europe italy in piglets showing severe diarrhea associated with porcine epidemic diarrhea the virus was phylogenetically related to european reoviruses of human and bat origin and to us and chinese pig mrv3
an outbreak of giardiasis was observed in a sheep farm in central italy infected lambs 30-90 days of age showed a malabsorption syndrome decreased weight gain and impairment in feed efficiency the most relevant clinical sign was the excretion of malodorous and poorly formed faeces whereas diarrhoea was rarely observed in the flock laboratory investigations revealed the presence of giardia in affected animals while no other significant viral bacterial or parasitic pathogens were identified in faeces or tissue samples a mild to severe infiltrative enteritis with eosinophils lymphocytes and plasma cells was detected in histological sections of the gut giardia parasites collected from duodenal aspirates were typed as giardia duodenalis assemblage b by pcr amplification and sequencing of the tpi gene treatment with fenbendazole at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days successfully cleared the infection these results show that g duodenalis can cause significant economic losses in sheep farming #
background previous data suggest that fecal s100a12 has clinical utility as a biomarker of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease in both people and dogs but the effect of gastrointestinal pathogens on fecal s100a12 concentrations is largely unknown the role of s100a12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of s100a12 expression in rodents thus the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal s100a12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites cystoisospora spp toxocara canis giardia sp and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs coronavirus parvovirus as a comparative model methods spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies in french breeding kennels and fecal scores semiquantitative system scores 1−13 were assigned fecal samples were tested for cystoisospora spp c canis and c ohioensis toxocara canis giardia sp as well as canine coronavirus ccv and parvovirus cpv s100a12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an inhouse radioimmunoassay statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons non-parametric correlation analysis association testing between nominal variables and construction of a multivariate mixed model results fecal s100a12 concentrations ranged from < 24−14363 ng/g univariate analysis only showed increased fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs shedding cystoisospora spp p = 0.0384 and in dogs infected with parvovirus p = 0.0277 whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal s100a12 concentrations p = 0.0345 however shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal s100a12 concentrations in multivariate analysis all p > 0.05 in this study only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal s100a12 concentrations in multivariate analysis p < 0.0001 conclusions an infection with any single enteropathogen tested in this study is unlikely to alter fecal s100a12 concentrations and these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal s100a12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal s100a12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation
first discovered in the early 1950s reoviruses respiratory enteric orphan viruses were not associated with any known disease and hence named orphan viruses recently our group reported the isolation of the melaka virus from a patient with acute respiratory disease and provided data suggesting that this new orthoreovirus is capable of human-to-human transmission and is probably of bat origin here we report yet another melaka-like reovirus named kampar virus isolated from the throat swab of a 54 year old male patient in kampar perak malaysia who was suffering from high fever acute respiratory disease and vomiting at the time of virus isolation serological studies indicated that kampar virus was transmitted from the index case to at least one other individual and caused respiratory disease in the contact case sequence analysis of the four small class genome segments indicated that kampar and melaka viruses are closely related this was confirmed by virus neutralization assay showing an effective two-way cross neutralization i e the serum against one virus was able to neutralize the other although the exact origin of kampar virus is unknown epidemiological tracing revealed that the house of the index case is surrounded by fruit trees frequently visited by fruit bats there is a high probability that kampar virus originated from bats and was transmitted to humans via bat droppings or contaminated fruits the discovery of kampar virus highlights the increasing trend of emergence of bat zoonotic viruses and the need to expand our understanding of bats as a source of many unknown viruses

understanding the environmental drivers of zoonotic reservoir and human interactions is crucial to understanding disease risk but these drivers are poorly predicted we propose a mechanistic understanding of human-reservoir interactions using hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as a case study crucial processes underpinning the disease's incidence remain poorly studied including the connectivity among natural and peridomestic deer mouse host activity virus transmission and human exposure we found that disease cases were greatest in arid states and declined exponentially with increasing precipitation within arid environments relatively rare climatic conditions e g el niño are associated with increased rainfall and reservoir abundance producing more frequent virus transmission and host dispersal we suggest that deer mice increase their occupancy of peridomestic structures during spring-summer amplifying intraspecific transmission and human infection risk disease incidence in arid states may increase with predicted climatic changes mechanistic approaches incorporating reservoir behavior reservoir-human interactions and pathogen spillover could enhance our understanding of global hantavirus ecology with applications to other directly transmitted zoonoses
in this perspective we offer views on how microbial activities may change in response to the impact of human activities and an increasing human population new knowledge is forthcoming in microbiology and immunology on the biology of emerging pathogens with the exposure of human populations to changing environments through climate change and human encroachment into previously unpopulated areas there is likely to be increased incidences of diseases caused by existing emerging and previously unrecognised pathogens
the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic was characterized by increased pathogenicity in the elderly due to an early exacerbated innate host response sars-cov is a zoonotic pathogen that entered the human population through an intermediate host like the palm civet to prevent future introductions of zoonotic sars-cov strains and subsequent transmission into the human population heterologous disease models are needed to test the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics against both late human and zoonotic isolates here we show that both human and zoonotic sars-cov strains can infect cynomolgus macaques and resulted in radiological as well as histopathological changes similar to those seen in mild human cases viral replication was higher in animals infected with a late human phase isolate compared to a zoonotic isolate while there were significant differences in the number of host genes differentially regulated during the host responses between the three sars-cov strains the top pathways and functions were similar and only apparent early during infection with the majority of genes associated with interferon signaling pathways this study characterizes critical disease models in the evaluation and licensure of therapeutic strategies against sars-cov for human use
escherichia coli o157h7 an important food-borne pathogen has become a major public health concern worldwide the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiologic feature of e coli o157h7 strains in china 105 e coli o157h7 isolates were collected from various hosts and places over 9 years a multilocus sequence typing scheme mlst was applied for bacteria genotyping and polymerase chain reaction pcr was used for virulence factor identification seven new mlst sequence types sts namely st836 st837 st838 st839 st840 st841 and st842 were identified which grouped into two lineages phylogenetic analysis suggested that the most two frequent sts in china st837 and st836 may be the derivatives of e coli o157h7 sakai or e coli o157h7 edl933 geographical diversity and host variety of e coli o157h7 were observed in china in addition the different distribution of tccp was detected the data presented herein provide new insights into the molecular epidemiologic feature of e coli o157h7 and aid in the investigation of the transmission regularity and evolutionary mechanism of e coli o157h7

this report describes the production of several mabs against n195 protein a major immunodomain of sars cov nucleocapsid protein . one representative igg1 monoclonal antibody mab s-a5d5 was selected and characterized s-a5d5 reacted specifically react with both recombinant and native nucleocapsid protein of sars cov the reactivity of s-a5d5 with purified n195 protein and utilization of the mab as a detector antibody to develop an antigen capture elisa was assessed as little as 37.5 pg of purified n protein and 50 tcid 50 of sars cov could be detected by the antigen capture elisa specific binding of the mab s-a5d5 to both purified n195 and sars cov nucleocapsid antigen was effectively inhibited by human sars positive serum and guinea pig anti-n195 serum the n protein in n195-spike recombinant baculovirus-infected sf-9 cells could also be identified n protein was detected in 18 ifa igm-positive serum samples collected from sars confirmed patients but not in nine samples collected from sars recovery patient no false positive results were given when 60 samples from healthy individuals were tested and no cross-reaction occurred when infectious bronchitis virus ibv chicken coronavirus was tested this monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture elisa is thus a powerful tool for early diagnosis of sars cov infection
p34 is an antimicrobial peptide produced by a bacillus sp strain isolated from the intestinal contents of a fish in the brazilian amazon basin with reported antibacterial activity the aim of this work was to evaluate the peptide p34 for its in vitro antiviral properties against canine adenovirus type 2 cav-2 canine coronavirus ccov canine distemper virus cdv canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 equine arteritis virus eav equine influenza virus eiv feline calicivirus fcv and feline herpesvirus type 1 fhv-1 the results showed that the peptide p34 exhibited antiviral activity against eav and fhv-1 the peptide p34 inhibited the replication of eav by 99.9% and fhv-1 by 94.4%. virucidal activity was detected only against eav when p34 and eav were incubated for 6 h at 37°c the viral titer reduced from 10 4.5 tcid 50 to 10 2.75 tcid 50 showing a percent of inhibition of 98.6%. in conclusion our results demonstrated that p34 inhibited eav and fhv-1 replication in infected cell cultures and it showed virucidal activity against eav since there is documented resistance to the current drugs used against herpesviruses and there is no treatment for equine viral arteritis it is advisable to search for new antiviral compounds to overcome these infections
the present study was designed for the detection of the most prevalent respiratory infections in chicken flocks and clarifying their interaction and impact on flock health a total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of newcastle disease virus ndv infectious bronchitis virus ibv influenza type a mycoplasma gallisepticum mg and mycoplasma synoviae ms molecular prevalence of ndv ibv low pathogenic avian influenza virus lpaiv h9n2 mg and ms was carried out on swab and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction pcr and reverse transcription-pcr results seroprevalence of ndv ibv influenza type a virus mg and ms in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4% 50.9% 12.7% 14.5% and 3.6% respectively specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks indicating concurrent viral infections the molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses ndv ibv and lpaiv h9n2 while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected the molecular prevalence rate of ndv ibv and lpaiv h9n2 was 46.97% 56.1% and 19.7% in backyard flocks respectively combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks respectively mixed infection of ibv lpaiv h9n2 and/or escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks inducing severe clinical outcomes avian pathogenic e coli was respectively isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality mixed infection of e coli and mg reported in 9.1% of broiler flock mg was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while ms was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with e coli and other viruses our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate the high prevalence of ibv either as a single or combined infection with lpaiv h9n2 and/or e coli in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens
influenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often severe consequences for both animal and human health in 2011 a novel member of the orthomyxoviridae family influenza d virus idv was identified in the respiratory tract of swine epidemiological surveys revealed that idv is distributed worldwide among livestock and that idv-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock to identify the transmission capability of idv to humans we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans the inoculation of idv revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures intriguingly the replication characteristics of idv revealed higher replication kinetics compared to influenza c virus despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells collectively these results might indicate why idv-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock

bovine coronavirus bcov is a recognized cause of severe neonatal calf diarrhea with a negative impact on animal welfare leading to economic losses to the livestock industry cattle production is one of the most important economic sectors in uruguay the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of bcov infections and their genetic diversity in uruguayan calves and to describe the evolutionary history of the virus in south america the overall detection rate of bcov in uruguay was 7.8% 64/824 7.7% 60/782 in dairy cattle and 9.5% 4/42 in beef cattle the detection rate of bcov in samples from deceased and live calves was 10.0% 6/60 and 7.6% 58/763 respectively interestingly there was a lower frequency of bcov detection in calves born to vaccinated dams 3.3% 8/240 than in calves born to unvaccinated dams 12.2% 32/263 or 4.02 95%ci 1.81-8.90 p = 0.00026 the frequency of bcov detection was higher in colder months 11.8% 44/373 than in warmer months 1.5% 3/206 or 9.05 95%ci 2.77-29.53 p = 0.000013 uruguayan strains grouped together in two different lineages one with argentinean strains and the other with brazilian strains both bcov lineages were estimated to have entered uruguay in 2013 one of them from brazil 95%hpd interval 2011 and the other from argentina 95%hpd interval 2010-2014 the lineages differed by four amino acid changes and both were divergent from the mebus reference strain surveillance should be maintained to detect possible emerging strains that can clearly diverge at the antigenic level from vaccine strains
coronaviruses infect animals and humans causing a wide range of diseases the diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication this dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host resulting in substantial change in virulence feline enteric coronavirus fecv causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats but a highly fatal disease called feline infectious peritonitis fip can arise through mutation of fecv to fip virus fipv the pathogenesis of fip is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of t cells features shared by some other coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus the increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs but no such measures are yet available previously we have reported the inhibitors that target 3c-like protease 3clpro with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses here we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3clpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with fip experimental fip is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent we found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever ascites lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats these results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of fip these findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans
background mers-cov is a newly emerged human coronavirus reported closely related with hku4 and hku5 bat coronaviruses bat and mers corona-viruses are structurally related therefore it is of interest to estimate the degree of conserved antigenic sites among them it is of importance to elucidate the shared antigenic-sites and extent of conservation between them to understand the evolutionary dynamics of mers-cov results multiple sequence alignment of the spike s membrane m enveloped e and nucleocapsid n proteins was employed to identify the sequence conservation among mers and bat hku4 hku5 coronaviruses we used various in silico tools to predict the conserved antigenic sites we found that mers-cov shared 30 % of its s protein antigenic sites with hku4 and 70 % with hku5 bat-cov whereas 100 % of its e m and n protein's antigenic sites are found to be conserved with those in hku4 and hku5 conclusion this sharing suggests that in case of pathogenicity mers-cov is more closely related to hku5 bat-cov than hku4 bat-cov the conserved epitopes indicates their evolutionary relationship and ancestry of pathogenicity
hepatitis e virus hev and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and are both globally prevalent in the pig population while hev does not cause clinical disease in pigs its zoonotic potential has raised concerns in the food safety sector prrs has become endemic in the united kingdom uk since its introduction in 1991 and continues to cause considerable economic losses to the swine industry a better understanding of the current prevalence and diversity of prrsv and hev in the uk and their potential association is needed to assess risks and target control measures appropriately this study used plasma tonsil and cecal content samples previously collected from pigs in 14 abattoirs in england and northern ireland to study the prevalence of several pathogens including prrsv and hev the diversity of prrsv strains detected in these samples was analyzed by sequencing open reading frame 5 orf5 revealing no substantial difference in prrsv strains from these clinically unaffected pigs relative to those from clinical cases of disease in the uk despite the potential immuno-modulatory effect of prrsv infection previously demonstrated to affect salmonella and hev shedding profiles no significant association was found between positive prrsv status and positive hev status
we have recently reported the isolation of a novel virus provisionally designated c/swine/oklahoma/1334/2011 c/ ok with 50% overall homology to human influenza c viruses icv from a pig in oklahoma deep rna sequencing of c/ok virus found a matrix 1 m1 protein expression strategy that differed from that of icv the novelty of c/ok virus prompted us to investigate whether c/ok virus could exist in a nonswine species significantly we found that c/ok virus was widespread in u s bovine herds as demonstrated by reverse transcription rt-pcr and serological assays genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings to determine whether swine/bovine c/ok viruses can undergo reassortment with human icv and to clarify the taxonomic status of c/ok in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion agid were conducted in vitro reassortment using two human icv and two swine and bovine c/ok viruses demonstrated that human icv and c/ok viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny antigenically no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in agid between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens taken together these results demonstrate thatc/ok virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from icv the classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the orthomyxoviridae family is proposed the finding of c/ok virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals including humans here we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines deep rna sequencing phylogenetic analysis and in vitro reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal icv-like viruses are genetically distinct from human icv antigenically we show that icv-like viruses are not recognized by icv antibodies en masse these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus the finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health . 2014 characterization of a novel influenza virus in cattle and swine proposal for a new genus in the orthomyxoviridae family mbio 52e00031-14
influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases endangering the health of humans especially young children and the elderly although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza frequent mutations in viral surface antigens low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines however no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the united states in this study we found that a novel adjuvant rov-asp-1 co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model rov-asp-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine allowing antigensparring by 10-fold the rov-asp-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum importantly rov-asp-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain these results demonstrate that rov-asp-1 is an effective adjuvant that 1 accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine 2 allows for antigen sparing and 3 augments a th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain
respiratory syncytial virus rsv was first described 160 years ago but was not officially recognized as a cause of serious illness in children until the late 1950s it has been estimated that virtually all children have had at least one rsv infection by their second birthday rsv is responsible for annual disease outbreaks usually during a defined winter seasonal period that can vary by community and year rsv is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization among young children worldwide infants of young chronologic age and children with predisposing factors such as premature birth pulmonary disease or congenital heart disease are most susceptible to serious illness unlike other viruses immunity to rsv infection is incomplete and short lived and reinfection is common throughout life initial attempts to develop a vaccine in the 1960s met with unexpected and tragic results many children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated wild-type virus developed serious pulmonary disease upon subsequent natural infection numerous other vaccine technologies have since been studied including vectored approaches virus-like particles dna vaccines and live attenuated virus vaccine as of early 2010 only two companies or institutions had rsv vaccine candidates in early clinical trials and no vaccine is likely to be licensed for marketing in the immediate future
rabies virus rabv is the only lyssavirus known to be present within the caribbean the island of trinidad is richly diverse in chiropteran fauna and endemic for bat-transmitted rabies with low rabv isolation rates observed in this population we aimed to determine the seroprevalence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies rvna in light of spatio-temporal and bat demographic factors to infer the extent of natural exposure to rabv in the trinidadian bat population rvna titers were determined by the rabv micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity from 31 locations across the island over 5 years rvna was positively detected in 33 samples 8.6% representing 6 bat species mainly frugivorous with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 iu/ml mean 1.66 iu/ml the analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity thus juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults estimate 1.13 p = 0.04 which may suggest early exposure to the rabv with possible implications for viral amplification in this population temporal variation in rabies seropositivity 2012-2014 versus 2015-2017 estimate 1.07 p = 0.03 may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation regarding other factors investigated rvna was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species the most common seropositive species artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure the findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in trinidad
background among all known picornaviruses only two species equine rhinitis a virus and equine rhinitis b virus erbv are known to infect horses causing respiratory infections no reports have described the detection of erbv in fecal samples of horses and no complete genome sequences of erbv3 are available methods we performed a molecular epidemiology study to detect erbvs in horses from dubai and hong kong complete genome sequencing of the erbvs as well as viral loads and genome phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis were performed on the positive samples results erbv was detected in four 13.8 % of the 29 fecal samples in horses from dubai with viral loads 8.28 × 10 3 to 5.83 × 10 4 copies per ml but none of the 47 fecal samples in horses from hong kong by rt-pcr complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the four strains were erbv3 and one was erbv2 the major difference between the genomes of erbv3 and those of erbv1 and erbv2 lied in the amino acid sequences of their vp1 proteins the ka/ks ratios of all the coding regions in the erbv3 genomes were all <0.1 suggesting that erbv3 were stably evolving in horses using the uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock model on vp1 gene the date of the most recent common ancestor mrca of erbv3 was estimated to be 1785 hpds 1176hpds to 1937 and the mrca dates of erbv1 and erbv2 were estimated to be 1848 hpds 1466 to 1949 respectively conclusions both acid stable erbv3 and acid labile erbv2 erbvs could be found in fecal samples of horses detection of erbvs in fecal samples would have implications for their transmission and potential role in gastrointestinal diseases as well as fecal sampling as an alternative method of identifying infected horses picornaviruses are widely distributed in human and various animals in which they can cause respiratory cardiac hepatic neurological mucocutaneous and systemic diseases of varying severity . based on genotypic and serological characterization the family picornaviridae is currently divided into 26 genera among all the known picornaviruses only two species namely equine rhinitis a virus erav and equine rhinitis b virus erbv are known to infect horses erav formerly called equine rhinovirus 1 belongs to the genus aphthovirus whereas erbv further subclassified into three serotypes including erbv1 and erbv2 which are acid labile and were previously known as equine rhinovirus 2 and 3 respectively and erbv3 which was previously called acid-stable equine picornavirus is the only species of a recently created species of the genus erbovirus .both erav and erbv are associated with respiratory diseases in horses and are therefore primarily found in nasal nasopharyngeal and oral secretions . infected horses develop fever anorexia nasal discharge cough and lymphadenitis these respiratory diseases in horses are of particular importance because of their effect on
despite the success of the who-led smallpox eradication programme a quarter of a century ago there remains considerable fear that variola virus or other related pathogenic poxviruses such as monkeypox could re-emerge and spread disease in the human population even today we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses this review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers despite remarkable advances in the control and treatment of infectious diseases the problem of emerging and re-emerging pathogens is likely to be one of the main issues of medical and public health in the twenty-first century 1 . viral diseases are of particular concern because advances in the field of antiviral drugs have lagged behind those of bacteriocidal drugs and antibiotics instead the use of vaccines and good medical practices remain the traditional strategies to control viral infections also particularly in the case of emerging viral pathogens the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines can lag behind the time of viral emergence by years or even decades as the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars taught us new members from neglected virus families can cross into humans from unsuspected reservoirs necessitating rapid advances in our understanding of novel virus-host dynamics before the development of effective vaccines and drugs can even be contemplated 2 . indeed if there is one certainty in this new century it is that viral pathogens will continue to emerge in the human population it is therefore worthwhile to consider lessons that have been learned from the one viral pathogen -variola virus -that has killed more members of the human population over the span of recorded history than all other infectious diseases combined
the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus sars-cov bats of several species in southern people's republic of china harbor sars-like covs and may be reservoir hosts for them to determine whether bats in north america also harbor coronaviruses we used reverse transcription-pcr to detect coronavirus rna in bats we found coronavirus rna in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested the prevalence of viral rna shedding was high 17% in eptesicus fuscus and 50% in myotis occultus sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these rocky mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of asian bats because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in north america are needed
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a member of the alphacoronaviridae genus within the coronaviridae family it is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets pedv causes severe economic loss and has been in existence for decades a panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward pedv this report details several design changes made to a hepatitis b virus core antigen hbcag-based recombinant vaccine strategy and their effect in vivo initially several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four b-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins however a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines the focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the ysnigvck amino acid motif from pedv genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody ab response to the ysnigvck epitope which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the co strain of pedv additionally the location of the inserted pedv epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native hbcag during vaccination
the nairoviruses are a rapidly emerging group of tick-borne bunyaviruses that includes pathogens of humans crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus and livestock nairobi sheep disease virus also known as ganjam virus as well as a large number of viruses for which the normal vertebrate host has not been established studies on this group of viruses have been fairly limited not least because cchfv is a bsl4 human pathogen restricting the number of labs able to study the live virus while nsdv although highly pathogenic in naive animals is not seen as a threat in developed countries making it a low priority nevertheless recent years have seen significant progress in our understanding of the biology of these viruses particularly that of cchfv and this article seeks to draw together our existing knowledge to generate an overall picture of their molecular biology underlining areas of particular ignorance for future studies
bovine respiratory disease brd is a major source of economic loss within the agricultural industry vaccination against brd-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals diva is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines but during virus outbreaks diva responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination the current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and nonvaccinated animals following infection-challenge male holstein friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated pfizer rispoval ® pi3+rsv and subsequently challenged with bovine parainfluenza virus type-3 bpi3v via nasal inoculation metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p i with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased 3-indolepropionic acid in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p i may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre during latter stages of infection increased levels of n-glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p i these findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals
susceptibility to bovine respiratory disease brd is multi-factorial and is influenced by stress in conjunction with infection by both bacterial and viral pathogens while vaccination is broadly used in an effort to prevent brd it is far from being fully protective and cases diagnosed from a combination of observed clinical signs without any attempt at identifying the causal pathogens are usually treated with antibiotics dairy and beef cattle losses from brd are profound worldwide and genetic studies have now been initiated to elucidate host loci which underlie susceptibility with the objective of enabling molecular breeding to reduce disease prevalence in this study we employed rna sequencing to examine the bronchial lymph node transcriptomes of controls and beef cattle which had individually been experimentally challenged with bovine respiratory syncytial virus infectious bovine rhinotracheitis bovine viral diarrhea virus pasteurella multocida mannheimia haemolytica or mycoplasma bovis to identify the genes that are involved in the bovine immune response to infection we found that 142 differentially expressed genes were located in previously described quantitative trait locus regions associated with risk of brd mutations affecting the expression or amino acid composition of these genes may affect disease susceptibility and could be incorporated into molecular breeding programs
the application of the immunoperoxidase ip plaque staining procedure ip test to the diagnosis of canine coronavirus ccv infection was investigated the ip test did not react with sera from either 15 speci¢c pathogen-free spf dogs or 7 spf dogs immunized with a multivalent vaccine including canine parvovirus type 2 canine distemper virus canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parain£uenza virus to compare the ip test with the neutralizing test nt sera from 240 healthy dogs and from 3 experimentally ccv-infected dogs were examined all 60 sera positive for nt antibody were positive for ip antibody and all 180 sera negative for nt antibody were negative for ip antibody in the healthy dogs the ip titres showed similar changes with time after ccv inoculation to those of the nt titres in the experimentally infected dogs these ¢ndings indicate that the ip test speci¢cally detected anti-ccv antibodies when the ip test and nt were compared in dogs with diarrhoeic signs 2.1% of 48 sera and 20.3% of 74 sera which were all negative for nt antibody were positive for ip antibody in the dogs of under one year of age and at least one year of age respectively the di¡erence between the ip and nt titres log 10 ^log 10 for the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age 2.350+0.931 was signi¢cantly larger than that for the healthy dogs 0.982+0.447 p50.0001 the nt titre being negative or very low despite a high ip titre in many diarrhoeic dogs hence the ip test is more able to detect anti-ccv antibodies especially in dogs showing clinical signs the ip-positivity rate was signi¢cantly higher in the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age 48.7% than in the healthy dogs 25.0% w 2 = 19.844 p50.0001 suggesting that ccv may contribute to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs

although single stranded ss dna viruses that infect humans and their domesticated animals do not generally cause major diseases the arthropod borne ssdna viruses of plants do and as a result seriously constrain food production in most temperate regions of the world besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssdna viruses it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssdna molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssdna viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments the host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global open access geminivirus satellites genus begomovirus east african cassava mosaic virus ef011664 canine parvovirus ns1 parvovirus ns2 cp vp2 cp vp1

in addition to classical virus isolation in cell culture the molecular detection of new virus variants by pcr techniques allows broader epidemiological insights into the world of viral pathogens for the detection of hantaviruses -zoonotic viruses leading to fever and organ failure in humans -we developed a genus-wide nested rt-pcr format which enables the discovery of new members within this virus genus the methodological approach allowed the demonstration of first hantaviruses from africa and revealed new hantavirus reservoir hosts as shrews moles and bats
1 bats host many viruses that are significant for human and domestic animal health but the dynamics of these infections in their natural reservoir hosts remain poorly elucidated 2 in these and other systems there is evidence that seasonal life-cycle events drive infection dynamics directly impacting the risk of exposure to spillover hosts understanding these dynamics improves our ability to predict zoonotic spillover from the reservoir hosts 3 to this end we followed henipavirus antibody levels of >100 individual e helvum in a closed captive breeding population over a 30-month period using a powerful novel antibody quantitation method 4 we demonstrate the presence of maternal antibodies in this system and accurately determine their longevity we also present evidence of population-level persistence of viral infection and demonstrate periods of increased horizontal virus transmission associated with the pregnancy/lactation period 5 the novel findings of infection persistence and the effect of pregnancy on viral transmission as well as an accurate quantitation of chiropteran maternal antiviral antibody half-life provide fundamental baseline data for the continued study of viral infections in these important reservoir hosts
antibodies through passive or active immunization play a central role in prophylaxis against many infectious agents while neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses the relative contribution of fcdependent and complement-dependent anti-viral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies the multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses in addition to virus size influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization these new findings will improve our strategies in therapeutic antibody engineering and rational vaccine design
doughnut-shaped particles 55-65 nm in diameter were revealed by electron microscopy in the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells from an active lesion in autopsied brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient the morphology of the particles closely resembled that of coronaviruses
probiotic bacillales are effective in controlling pathogens live probiotic bacteria improve the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota leading to a reduction in pathogen colonization however it remains largely unknown how probiotics regulate the host's immunologic responses and protect the host from parasitic infection in this study we addressed whether bacillales were effective against haemonchus contortus a parasitic nematode that infects small ruminants worldwide using 16s rrna sequencing we found that bacillales were largely depleted in the abomasal microbiota of sheep infected with h contortus we constructed a recombinant bacillus subtilis named rbs cotb-hcg that express the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of h contortus hcgapdh on its spore surface using the bacillus subtilis spore coat protein b cotb as a carrier mice receiving rbs cotb-hcg orally showed strong th1-dominated immune responses more importantly sheep administered bs cotb-hcg per os showed increasing proliferation of the peripheral blood mononucleates elevated anti-hcgapdh igg in sera and higher anti-hcgapdh siga in the intestinal mucus than the control sheep the average weight gain of h contortusinfected sheep treated with rbs cotb-hcg hcϩrbs cotb-hcg was 48.73% greater than that of unvaccinated sheep furthermore these hcϩrbs cotb-hcg sheep had fewer eggs per gram of feces by 84.1% and adult worms by 71.5%. they also demonstrated greatly lessened abomasal damage by h contortus with an abundance of probiotic species in the abomasal microbiota collectively our data unequivocally demonstrate the protective roles of cotb-hcgapdh-expressing b subtilis spores in against h contortus infection and showed great potential of using probiotic-based strategy in controlling parasitic nematodes of socioeconomic importance in general importance initial analyses of the abomasal microbiota of sheep using 16s rrna sequencing suggested that probiotic bacteria played a protective role in against h contortus infection a recombinant bacillus subtilis expressing a fusion protein cotb-hcgapdh on its spore's surface induced strong th1 immune response in a murine model the same probiotic recombinant upon only one oral application protected sheep against h contortus infection by reducing egg shedding and decreasing adult worm loads of the parasite and increasing body weight gain of infected sheep both th1 and th2 immune responses were evident in these immunized sheep
avian infectious bronchitis ib is a widely distributed poultry disease that has huge economic impact on poultry industry the continuous emergence of new ibv genotypes and lack of cross protection among different ibv genotypes have been an important challenge although live attenuated ib vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response the potential risk of reversion to virulence neutralization by the maternal antibodies and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage on the other hand inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens consequently alternative ib vaccines are widely sought recent advances in recombinant dna technology have resulted in experimental ib vaccines that show promise in antibody and t-cells responses comparable to live attenuated vaccines recombinant dna vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors nanoadjuvants and in ovo vaccination approaches although most recombinant ib dna vaccines are yet to be licensed it is expected that these types of vaccines may hold sway as future vaccines for inducing a cross protection against multiple ibv serotypes
interferons ifns are a first line of defense against viral infection herein we describe the use of an adenovirus vectored mouse ifn alpha gene mdef201 as a prophylactic and treatment countermeasure in a sars-cov-infected balb/c mouse model complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of mdef201 administered intranasally 1 3 5 7 or 14 days prior to lethal sars-cov challenge p<0.001 and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge in addition low doses of mdef201 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology intranasal treatment with mdef201 ranging from 10 6 to 10 8 pfu significantly protected mice against a lethal sars-cov infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12 h post infection p<0.001 the data suggest that mdef201 is a new class of antiviral agent further development as treatment for sars-cov infections
the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of tea saponins on oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide in chickens one hundred twenty chickens were randomly divided into 5 groups groups 3 to 4 received intramuscular injection of cyclophosphamide to induce oxidative stress and immunosuppression after that groups 2 and 4 were orally administered tea saponins in drinking water for 7 d then groups 1 to 4 were immunized with a live bivalent vaccine of newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus blood samples were collected for analysis of oxidative parameters and specific antibody titers and splenocytes were prepared for lymphocyte proliferative assay the results showed that adminis-tration of tea saponins significantly increased total antioxidant capacity total superoxide dismutase catalase glutathione peroxidase glutathione ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol and decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl enhanced immune responses such as lymphocyte proliferation induced by concanavalin a and lipopolysaccharides and serum newcastle disease virus-and infectious bronchitis virus-specific antibodies were also observed in chickens injected with or without cyclophosphamide in addition no side effects were found in chickens throughout the study therefore tea saponins may be a potential agent to improve imunosuppression induced by oxidative stress in chickens
to date six human coronaviruses have been known all of which are associated with respiratory infections in humans with the exception of the highly pathogenic sars and mers coronaviruses human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e and hcov-hku1 circulate worldwide and typically cause the common cold in most cases infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease although acute infections in infants the elderly and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization importantly no drugs against human coronaviruses exist and only supportive therapy is available previously we proposed the cationically modified chitosan n-2hydroxypropyl-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride htcc and its hydrophobicallymodified derivative hm-htcc as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus hcov-nl63 here we show that htcc inhibits interaction of a virus with its receptor and thus blocks the entry further we demonstrate that htcc polymers with different degrees of substitution act as effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses cell culture llc-mk2 cells atcc ccl-7 macaca mulatta kidney epithelial were maintained in minimal essential medium mem two parts hanks' mem and one part earle's mem life technologies poland supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum life technologies anticoronavirals htcc plos one |

the natural response of pigs to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv infections and vaccinations needs to be altered so that better protection is afforded against both homologous and heterologous challenges by this pathogen to address this problem real-time gene expression assays were coupled with cytokine elispot and protein analyses to assess the nature of the anti-prrsv response of pigs immunized with modified live virus mlv vaccine although t helper 1 th1 immunity was elicited in all vaccinated animals as evidenced by the genesis of prrsv-specific interferon-gamma secreting cells ifng sc the overall extent of the memory response was variable and generally weak peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc isolated from these pigs responded to prrsv exposure with a limited increase in their expression of the th1 immune markers ifng tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-15 il15 and a reduction in the quantity of mrnas encoding the innate and inflammatory proteins il1b il8 and ifna efforts to enhance th1 immunity by utilizing an expression plasmid encoding porcine ifna pina as an adjuvant resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of prrsvspecific ifng sc but only minor changes overall in the expression of th1 associated cytokine or innate immune marker mrna by virus-stimulated pbmc administration of pina however did correlate with decreased il1b secretion by cultured unstimulated pbmc but had no effect on their ability to release ifng thus while exogenous addition of ifna during prrsv
ticks are medically-important arthropods that maintain and transmit numerous emerging viruses china suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited here we report the virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from sfts-epidemic areas and serological investigation of sfts virus sftsv and nairobi sheep disease virus nsdv results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera including sftsv and nsdv sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the sftsv identified here was most closely related to human sftsv in sampling and surrounding areas and the nsdv to the previously identified nsdv from northeast china serological investigation of sftsv infection in goats revealed intensive activity in those areas surprisingly two different methods of nsdv serological investigation showed no sera positive for this virus
dengue viruses denv are the causative agents of dengue fever df and dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps a large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance denv infection investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs to study interactions between denv and antibodies these studies indicate that antibody neutralization of denvs is a "multi-hit" phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion the most potently neutralizing mouse mabs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain iii of the dengue envelope e protein one challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse mabs to better understand the human antibody response the human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different denv serotypes here we review studies conducted with immune sera and mabs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple denv serotypes the human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize denv represent a small fraction of the total denv-specific antibody response moreover these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion these studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion the leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement ade which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of fcγr bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes andviruses 2011 3 2375 macrophages here we review results from human animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ade hypothesis by understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance denv it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines
recently an outbreak of fatal infection caused by a pantropic variant strain cb/05 of canine coronavirus ccov has been reported in this study evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric ccov is not fully protective against strain cb/05 twenty-two 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric ccov were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight groups a and b and one control group of six group c dogs dogs in groups a and b were inoculated oronasally with different doses 4 × 10 5 or 4 × 10 3 tcid 50 of the pantropic strain cb/05 whereas dogs in group c were used as negative controls clinical post-mortem and virological investigations showed that despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric ccov dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain cb/05 this was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs mainly vomiting and diarrhoea involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia below 70% of the initial counts gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of cb/05 rna in thymus spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs the presence of viral rna in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered the present study demonstrates that strain cb/05 is able to induce infection and disease in dogs seropositive to enteric ccov thus highlighting the need for extensive epidemiological investigation and for the possible development of novel antigenically relevant vaccines
the prevalence of antibodies to bovine coronavirus bcv and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv infections was studied in 20 conventional and 20 organic dairy herds the organic farms had produced 'certified' milk for at least 2 years on two occasions with a 1-year interval 699 serum samples from 624 peri-parturient cows were tested by elisa for antibodies to bcv and brsv accompanying data relating to the sampled animals were collected in order to identify potential factors associated with increased antibody prevalence the antibody prevalence was high at both sampling times with approximately 85% and 80% of animals positive for antibodies to bcv and to brsv respectively conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to bcv and brsv than the organically managed herds p < 0.01 animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence p < 0.001 the findings of this study suggest that organic farm management may be effective in reducing the seroprevalence of these viruses relative to conventional farming methods
twenty-seven nanopeptides derived from the matrix m protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv were screened for their ability to elicit a recall interferon-γ ifn-γ response from the splenocytes of balb/c mice following dna vaccination and a booster vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus rwr-prrsv-m we identified two peptides amino acid residues k 93 fitsrcrl and f 57 gymtfvhf as cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitopes these peptides elicited significant numbers of ifn-γ secreting cells compared with other m nonapeptides and one irrelevant nonapeptide bioinformatics analysis showed that the former is an h-2k d -restricted ctl epitope and the latter is an h-2d d -restricted ctl epitope multiple amino acid sequence alignment among different prrsv m sequences submitted to genbank indicated that these two ctl epitopes are strongly conserved and they should therefore be considered for further research on the mechanisms of cellular immune responses to prrsv
it is likely that gene-based vaccines will enter the human vaccine area soon a few veterinary vaccines employing this concept have already been licensed and a multitude of clinical trials against infectious diseases or different forms of cancer are ongoing highly important when developing novel vaccines are the safety aspects and also new adjuvants and delivery techniques needs to be carefully investigated so that they meet all short-and long-term safety requirements one novel in vivo delivery method for plasmid vaccines is electroporation which is the application of short pulses of electric current immediately after and at the site of an injection of a genetic vaccine this method has been shown to significantly augment the transfection efficacy and the subsequent vaccine-specific immune responses however the dramatic increase in delivery efficacy offered by electroporation has raised concerns of potential increase in the risk of integration of plasmid dna into the host genome here we demonstrate the safety and lack of integration after immunization with a high dose of a multigene hiv-1 vaccine delivered intradermally using the needle free device biojector 2000 together with electroporation using derma vax tm dna vaccine skin delivery system we demonstrate that plasmids persist in the skin at the site of injection for at least four months after immunization however no association between plasmid dna and genomic dna could be detected as analyzed by qpcr following field inversion gel electrophoresis separating heavy and light dna fractions we will shortly initiate a phase i clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be immunized with this multiplasmid hiv-1 vaccine using a combination of the delivery methods jet-injection and intradermal electroporation
salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis is the aetiological agent of swine paratyphoid being a highly invasive zoonotic pathogen wild boar natural populations are experiencing a demographical expansion as well as some farms are breeding this species to release for hunting with management sometimes identical to that of domestic pigs including supplementation grouping and antibiotic treatments this situation increases the chance of contact between wild boars and livestock and potentially induces stress with different sanitary consequences the present work aims to describe the clinical features of recent outbreaks caused by s choleraesuis in wild boar from central-western spain as well as the antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic relationships of isolates involved 28 strains of s choleraesuis were isolated from 28 different wild boars belonging to 10 different game states located in central western spain and submitted to the clinical veterinary hospital cvh of the university of extremadura samples were taken from different organs and cultured according to the iso 65792002 procedure suspicious colonies were identified by pcr and antimicrobial resistance was evaluated by disc diffusion susceptibility test and the presence of the main resistance genes as well as 18 plasmid replicons frequently found among the enterobacteriaceae was verified by pcr pulsed field gel electrophoresis was applied to determine the genetic relationship between isolates the outbreaks under study were characterized by high mortality 35%-84% and a septicaemic presentation s choleraesuis was isolated from all the wild boars analysed and 26 of the 28 isolates presented resistance to at least one antibiotic the predominant resistances found were against sulphonamide streptomycin tetracycline and doxicicline and sul1 stra-strb and teta were the most prevalent resistance genes among isolates 10 strains carried fiia fib+h/1 or fiia+h/1 plasmids pfge classified the isolates into four different profiles grouped into two clusters this results show that prevention against s choleraesuis must be considered in the sanitary programs of the wild boar breeders antibiotic resistance epidemiology salmonella choleraesuis wild boar
interest in bat-borne diseases and parasites has grown in the past decade over concerns for human health however the drivers of parasite diversity among bat host species are understudied as are the links between parasite richness and emerging risks thus we aimed at exploring factors that explain macro and microparasite species richness in bats from southeast asia a hotspot of emerging infectious diseases first we identified bat species that need increased sampling effort for pathogen discovery our approach highlights pathogen investigation disparities among species within the same genus such as rhinolophus and pteropus secondly comparative analysis using independent contrasts method allowed the identification of likely factors explaining parasite and viral diversity of bats our results showed a key role of bat distribution shape an index of the fragmentation of bat distribution on parasite diversity linked to a decrease for both viral and endoparasite species richness we discuss how our study may contribute to a better understanding of the link between parasite species richness and emergence
lactococcus lactis nz9000 was selected as an antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infection an approximately 70 kda fragment of the n-terminal globular domain of the spike s protein s n protein from the coronavirus tgev was used as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen model recombinant l lactis expressing the s n protein was constructed with the pnz8112 plasmid expression and localization of the transcribed s n protein from the recombinant l nz 9000-rtgev-s n were detected via sds-page western blot and immunofluorescence balb/c mice orally immunized with l nz 9000-rtgev-s n produced local mucosal immune responses against tgev the induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on tgev infection these data indicated that the recombinant l lactis could be a valuable tool in the development of future vaccines against tgev
we tested 55 deceased vespertilionid bats of 12 species from southern germany for virus infections a new adenovirus was isolated from tissue samples of 2 pipistrellus pipistrellus bats which represents the only chiropteran virus isolate found in europe besides lyssavirus rabies virus evidence was found for adenovirus transmission between bats
infectious bronchitis virus ibv and newcastle disease virus ndv are two poultry pathogens seriously affecting the poultry industry here ibv s1 and the ectodomain of ndv f proteins were separately linked with the trans-membrane and carboxy-terminal domain of ibv s protein s tmct composing rs and rf thus a novel chimeric infectious bronchitis-newcastle disease ib-nd virus-like particles vlps vaccine containing the rs rf and ibv m protein was constructed under the transmission electron microscope tem vlps possessing similar morphology to natural ibv were observed to evaluate the immunogenicity of chimeric ib-nd vlps specific pathogen-free spf chickens were immunized with three increasing doses 50 75 and 100 µg protein of vlps results of elisas detecting ibv and ndv specific antibodies and il-4 and ifn-γ t cell cytokines indicated that vaccination with chimeric ib-nd vlps could efficiently induce humoral and cellular immune responses in the challenge study chimeric ib-nd vlps 100 µg protein provided 100% protection against ibv or ndv virulent challenge from death and viral rna levels in tissues and swabs were greatly reduced collectively chimeric ib-nd vlps are highly immunogenic and could provide complete protection from an ibv or ndv virulent challenge chimeric ib-nd vlps are an appealing vaccine candidate and a promising vaccine platform bearing multivalent antigens
we have previously observed that all known hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs are highly divergent from germline antibodies in contrast to bnabs against hendra virus nipah virus and sars coronavirus sars cov we have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature hiv-1-specific bnabs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies to further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived igm libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations they were panned against different hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins envs sars cov protein receptor-binding domain rbd and soluble hendra virus g protein sg despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived igm antibody repertoire no enrichment for binders of envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against rbd and sg one of the selected monoclonal antibodies against the rbd was of high nm affinity with only few somatic mutations these results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnabs against hiv-1 compared to sars cov and hendra virus hiv-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its env in contrast sars cov and hendra virus and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sg and rbd as vaccine immunogens
the epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases eids due to their influence on public health although asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many eids and upcoming infections several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world furthermore the emergence of new viral diseases/infections such as rift valley fever west nile fever sars coronavirus hendra virus avian influenza a h5n1 nipah virus zika virus and swine influenza a h1n1 virus from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents which is manifested within a host pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals wildlife and human populations the complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases the factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease eid interfaces include global travel urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human eids agricultural intensification for domestic animal eids translocation for wildlife eids human encroachment ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife-human eids encroachment new introductions and 'spill-over' and 'spill-back' and technology and industry for domestic animal-human eids the concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities including livestock health and production management this chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important 2 tads and eids along with the successes constraints limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches
sars-cov-2 commonly termed covid-19 for the illness it causes has infected >3.2 million people including >220000 deaths human milk igg originates mainly from blood therefore a sars-cov-2-reactive antibody ab response in milk would be expected 1 however igg comprises only ~2% of milk ab with most milk abs originating from mucosa-associated

bovine rhinitis viruses brvs cause mild respiratory disease of cattle in this study a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named rs3x formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1 isolated from infected cattle from the uk in the 1960s was obtained and analyzed compared to other closely related aphthoviruses major differences were detected in the leader protease l pro p1 2b and 3a proteins phylogenetic analysis revealed that rs3x was a member of the species bovine rhinitis a virus brav using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for aphthoviruses including brav rs3x and foot-and-mouth disease virus we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection however within each of the brv species multiple sites under positive selection were detected the results also suggest that the probability determined by recombination detection program for recombination events between brvs and other aphthoviruses including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant in contrast within brvs the probability of recombination increases the data reported here provide genetic information to assist in the identification of diagnostic signatures and research tools for brav
liposomes phospholipid bilayer vesicles represent an almost ideal carrier system for the preparation of synthetic vaccines due to their biodegradability and capacity to protect and transport molecules of different physicochemical properties including size hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and charge liposomal carriers can be applied by invasive e g i m . s c . i d . as well as non-invasive transdermal and mucosal routes in the last 15 years liposome vaccine technology has matured and several vaccines containing liposome-based adjuvants have been approved for human and veterinary use or have reached late stages of clinical evaluation given the intensifying interest in liposomebased vaccines it is important to understand precisely how liposomes interact with the immune system and how they stimulate immunity it has become clear that the physicochemical properties of liposomal vaccines -method of antigen attachment lipid composition bilayer fl uidity particle charge and other properties -exert strong effects on the resulting immune response in this chapter
background feline infectious peritonitis fip is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus fcov fcovs are divided into two serotypes with markedly different infection rates among cat populations around the world a baculovirus-expressed type-specific domain of the spike proteins of fcov was used to survey the infection of the two viruses over the past eight years in taiwan results an immunofluorescence assay based on cells infected with the recombinant viruses that was capable of distinguishing between the two types of viral infection was established a total of 833 cases from a teaching hospital was surveyed for prevalence of different fcov infections infection of the type i fcov was dominant with a seropositive rate of 70.4% whereas 3.5% of cats were infected with the type ii fcov in most cases results derived from serotyping and genotyping were highly agreeable however 16.7% 4/24 fip cats and 9.8% 6/61 clinically healthy cats were found to possess antibodies against both viruses moreover most of the cats 84.6% 22/26 infected with a genotypic untypable virus bearing a type i fcov antibody conclusion a relatively simple serotyping method to distinguish between two types of fcov infection was developed based on this method two types of fcov infection in taiwan was first carried out type i fcov was found to be predominant compared with type ii virus results derived from serotyping and genotyping support our current understanding of evolution of disease-related fcov and transmission of fip
it is well established that trans-placental transmission of classical swine fever virus csfv during mid-gestation can lead to persistently infected offspring the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of csfv to induce viral persistence upon early postnatal infection two litters of 10 piglets each were infected intranasally on the day of birth with low and moderate virulence csfv isolates respectively during six weeks after postnatal infection most of the piglets remained clinically healthy despite persistent high virus titres in the serum importantly these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral and cellular immune response at necropsy the most prominent gross pathological lesion was a severe thymus atrophy four weeks after infection pbmcs from the persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both specific csfv and non-specific pha stimulation in terms of ifn-γ-producing cells these results suggested the development of a state of immunosuppression in these postnatally persistently infected pigs however il-10 was undetectable in the sera of the persistently infected animals interestingly csfv-stimulated pbmcs from the persistently infected piglets produced il-10 nevertheless despite the addition of the anti-il-10 antibody in the pbmc culture from persistently infected piglets the response of the ifn-γ producing cells was not restored therefore other factors than il-10 may be involved in the general suppression of the t-cell responses upon csfv and mitogen activation interestingly bone marrow immature granulocytes were increased and targeted by the virus in persistently infected piglets taken together we provided the first data demonstrating the feasibility of csfv in generating a postnatal persistent disease which has not been shown for other members of the pestivirus genus yet since serological methods are routinely used in csfv surveillance persistently infected pigs might go unnoticed
background development of vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is limited by the lack of well-characterized animal models previous vaccine reports have noted robust neutralizing antibody and inflammatory responses in ferrets resulting in enhanced hepatitis methods we evaluated the humoral immune response and pathological end points in ferrets challenged with the urbani strain of sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov after having received formalin-inactivated wholevirus vaccine or mock vaccine results humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets sars-cov infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue as seen previously in infected mice no evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the ferrets all of the ferrets cleared the virus by day 14 1 week earlier if vaccinated conclusions the vaccine provided mild immune protection to the ferrets after challenge however there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole-virus vaccine the ferret may provide another useful model for evaluating sars vaccine safety and efficacy
a b s t r a c t influenza viruses exhibit a fascinating level of antigenic heterogeneity that facilitates re-infection in the human population the human antibody repertoire also manifests endless capability for variation in the genes that specify the portion of antibody molecules interacting with epitopes a recent explosion of techniques for isolating human monoclonal antibodies to viruses has led to isolation of new antibodies that allow glimpses into the molecular basis for recognition and escape that underlies the constant antigenic drift in influenza surface proteins these studies also reveal evidence for lifelong persistence of immunity to some influenza viruses
nipah virus niv a zoonotic paramyxovirus belonging to the genus henipavirus is classified as a biosafety level-4 pathogen based on its high pathogenicity in humans and the lack of available vaccines or therapeutics since its initial emergence in 1998 in malaysia this virus has become a great threat to domestic animals and humans sporadic outbreaks and person-to-person transmission over the past two decades have resulted in hundreds of human fatalities epidemiological surveys have shown that niv is distributed in asia africa and the south pacific ocean and is transmitted by its natural reservoir pteropid bats numerous efforts have been made to analyze viral protein function and structure to develop feasible strategies for drug design increasing surveillance and preventative measures for the viral infectious disease are urgently needed
trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellated protozoan belonging to the trypanosomatidae family the etiologic agent of chagas disease currently there is neither a licensed vaccine nor effective treatment characterizing an unmet clinical need the igy refers to the egg yolk immunoglobulin y = yolk and its production and use are subjects of many studies due to the diversity of its diagnostic and therapeutic applications several researchers have shown that the use of specific igy may prevent and/or control infectious and parasitic diseases based on these evidences the aim of this study was to immunize chickens with trypomastigotes of t cruzi in order to produce highly effective and pure antibodies igy as well as extract characterize quantify and verify cytotoxic effects of igy anti-t cruzi after the induction of igy production by chickens the eggs were collected and the igy was extracted by method of precipitation of polyethylene glycol 6000 the igy anti-t cruzi characterization was performed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page western-blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa moreover the cytotoxic or proliferative effects of igy anti-t cruzi was verified by mtt assay the concentration of igy in yolk was 8.41 ± 1.47 mg/ml the characterization of igy reveled bands of stained peptides with molecular weight between 75 and 50 kda and 37 and 25 kda in the elisa test was observed that there was antigen-antibody reaction throughout the sample period the concentrations of 1 5 and 10 mg/ml of igy anti-t cruzi presented no cytotoxic of proliferative effects in mononuclear and vero cells in vitro the results indicated that t cruzi is able to generate a high production of specific immunoglobulins in chickens it did not cause damage to the cell membrane and no proliferative effect
the pathogenicity of cryptosporidium species was studied by inoculation of two gnotobiotic calves with cryptosporidial oocysts that had been decontaminated by treatment with peracetic acid two control calves were inoculated with similar material from which the oocysts had been removed by filtration oocyst-inoculated animals shed cryptosporidium in their feces and developed depression weakness anorexia and diarrhea at necropsy five days after inoculation endogeneous stages of cryptosporidium were found in association with epithelial cells throughout the small and large intestines of these animals the parasites were most numerous in the lower small intestine atrophic villi disordered and degenerate villous epithelium and hyperplastic crypt epithelium were associated with infection in the small intestine control animals remained normal extraneous agents were not detected in any of the calves the results indicate that cryptosporidium can destroy intestinal epithelial cells and cause diarrhea in monoinfected gnotobiotic calves
a reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr targeting a 407 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid gene of bovine coronavirus bcv was developed for detection of bcv rna in feces of experimentally inoculated cattle the sensitivity and specificity of the rt-pcr were confirmed using tissue culture-adapted bcv strains and feces of 2 calves inoculated with bcv ten nonpregant bcv seropositive adult dairy cows were inoculated with winter dysentery wd n = 8 or calf diarrhea cd n = 2 strains of bcv intranasally and orally n = 2 or through a surgically-placed duodenal catheter n = 8 with and without dexamethasone treatment or feeding ice water the 6 cows inoculated with bcv intranasally and through a duodenal catheter 2 of 2 cows given cd bcv and 4 of 6 cows given wd bcv developed mild diarrhea and bcv was detected in diarrheal feces by rt-pcr elisa or immune electron microscopy these results suggest that cd and wd strains of bcv can cause diarrhea in adult cows in conjunction with host or environmental factors and that rt-pcr might be useful to diagnose bcv infections in calves and adult cows * bovine coronavirus bcv is an important pathogen of neonatal calf diarrhea cd . the virus also has been isolated from adult cattle experiencing acute diarrhea during outbreaks of winter dysentery wd . in a recent study individ- * present address
transmissible gastroenteritis virus grown in primary swine kidney cell cultures agglutinated erythroeytes from chicken guinea pig and cattle but not erythrocytes from mouse and goose the opthnal incubation temperature was at 4 ° c the hemagglutination ha reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum some factors involved in the ha and ha-inhibition hi were investigated and standard ha and hi tests were established hi antibody titers of individual pig sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers some viruses of the familiy coronaviridae such as human coronavirus 8 9 bovine eoronavirus 12 13 hemagglutinating eneephmomyelitis virus 6 7 11 and avian infectious bronchitis virus 1 3 are already known to have hemagglutinating ha activity these observations encouraged us to investigate the possibility of ha by transmissible gastroenteritis tge vires a member of the family coronaviridae as this has not been previously reported this paper describes our observations on the ha with the virus and ita-inhibition hi by specific antiserum
genetic recombination has frequently been observed in coronaviruses here we sequenced multiple complete genomes of dromedary camel coronavirus hku23 dccov-hku23 from nigeria morocco and ethiopia and identified several genomic positions indicative of cross-species virus recombination events among other betacoronaviruses of the subgenus embecovirus clade a beta-covs recombinant fragments of a rabbit coronavirus rbcov-hku14 were identified at the hemagglutinin esterase gene position homolog fragments of a rodent cov were also observed at 8.9-kda open reading frame 4a at the 3= end of the spike gene the patterns of recombination differed geographically across the african region highlighting a mosaic structure of dccov-hku23 genomes circulating in dromedaries our results highlighted active recombination of coronaviruses circulating in dromedaries and are also relevant to the emergence and evolution of other betacoronaviruses including middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov importance genetic recombination is often demonstrated in coronaviruses and can result in host range expansion or alteration in tissue tropism here we showed interspecies events of recombination of an endemic dromedary camel coronavirus hku23 with other clade a betacoronaviruses our results supported the possibility that the zoonotic pathogen mers-cov which also cocirculates in the same camel species may have undergone similar recombination events facilitating its emergence or may do so in its future evolution
chikungunya virus chikv a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus alphaviruses has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%. genetic variation in the virus has resulted in its adaptability towards the new vector aedes albopictus other than aedes aegypti which has widen the horizon of distribution towards nontropical and non-endemic areas as of now no licensed vaccines or therapies are available against chikv the treatment regimens for chikv are mostly symptomatic based on the clinical manifestations development of small molecule drugs and neutralizing antibodies are potential alternatives of worth investigating until an efficient or safe vaccine is approved neutralizing antibodies play an important role in antiviral immunity and their presence is a hallmark of viral infection in this review we describe prospects for effective vaccines and highlight importance of neutralizing antibody-based therapeutic and prophylactic applications to combat chikv infections we further discuss about the progress made towards chikv therapeutic interventions as well as challenges and limitation associated with the vaccine development furthermore this review describes the lesson learned from chikungunya natural infection which could help in better understanding for future development of antibody-based therapeutic measures
since 1918 infl uenza virus has been one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality especially among young children though the commonly circulating strain of the virus is not virulent enough to cause mortality the ability of the virus genome to mutate at a very high rate may lead to the emergence of a highly virulent strain that may become the cause of the next pandemic apart from the infl uenza virus strain circulating in humans h1n1 and h3n2 the avian infl uenza h5n1 h7 and h9 virus strains have also been reported to have caused human infections h5n1 h7 and h9 have shown their ability to cross the species barrier from birds to humans and further replicate in humans this review addresses the biological and epidemiological aspects of infl uenza virus and efforts to have a control on the virus globally
background since 2008 a progressive pneumonia has become prevalent in broilers and laying hens this disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers the objective of this study was to isolate and identify the pathogens that are responsible for the progressive pneumonia and establish an animal model for drug screening results 193 serum samples were collected from 8 intensive farms from 5 provinces in china and analysed in the current research our clinical survey showed that 65.2% to 100% of breeding broilers breeding layers broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ort antibodies from 8 intensive farms six ort isolates were identified by pcr and biochemical assays and two h9n2 viruses were isolated newcastle disease virus ndv and infectious bronchitisvirus ibv were excluded typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ort isolate alone and in those co-infected with ort and h9n2 virus isolates specifically the survival rate was 30% 20% 70% 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ort+h9n2 virus ort followed by h9n2 virus h9n2 virus followed by ort and ort or h9n2 virus alone respectively conclusions the results of this study suggest that ort infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in china ort infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if h9n2 aiv is also present although the isolation of ort and h9n2 virus has been reported previously there have been no reported co-infections of poultry with these two pathogens this is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ort and h9n2 virus and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in china which has caused extensive economic losses
mammalian orthoreoviruses mrvs have a wide geographic distribution and can infect virtually all mammals infections in humans may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic this study describes the isolation and identification of a natural reassortant mrv from least horseshoe bats rhinolophus pusillu in china referred to as rpmrv-yn2012 the rpmrv-yn2012 was obtained from urine samples of rhinolophus pusillus by cell culture negative-staining electron microscopy revealed that rpmrv-yn2012 was a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with *75 nm in diameter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page migration patterns of the genome segments showed that rpmrv-yn2012 contained 10 segments in a 334 arrangement the whole genome sequence of rpmrv2012 was determined the consensus terminal sequences of all segments of 5'-gcuah . .yucauc-3' h = a u or c y = c or u were similar to the mrv species within the genus orthoreovirus its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis the results showed that rpmrv-yn2012 is a novel serotype 2 mrv that may have originated from reassortment among bat human and/or pig mrv strains which associated with diarrhea acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in animals and humans rpmrv-yn2012 is a novel bat reassortant mrv which may have resulted from a reassortment involving mrvs known to infect humans and animals it is necessary to identify whether rpmrv-yn2012 is associated with diarrhea acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing plos one | clean plastic sheets measuring 2.0 by 2.0m were placed under bat roosting sites at approximately 1700 the fresh urine and fecal samples were collected at the following morning approximately 730 to 800 pharyngeal swab and anal swab samples from captured bats were immersed into maintenance media in a virus sampling tube yocon china after collecting the swab samples all bats were released at their capture site the samples were transported to the laboratory under chilled conditions and stored at −80°c until being processed
two serological tests were used to examine the antigenic relationships between murine hepatitis viruses that cause different diseases in mice antisera prepared by immunization of mice with the individual viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize both the homologous immunogen and the other viruses by a plaque reduction neutralization test each antiserum was found to be specific for the immunizing virus however there was substantial cross-reactivity indicating the viruses were closely related by kinetic neutralization two of the viruses tested mhv-jtim and mhv-2 were found to be antigenically distinct mhv-3 and mhv-a59 were found to be antigenieally very similar but distinct these data show that kinetic neutralization is a more precise method for determining the antigenic relationships between murine coronaviruses
morbidity mortality and loss of productivity from enteric diseases in neonatal piglets cost swine producers millions of dollars annually in 2013-2014 the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv outbreak led to $900 million to $1.8 billion in annual losses to us swine producers passive lactogenic immunity remains the most promising and effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from enteric diseases like pedv protecting suckling piglets through lactogenic immunity is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific iga plasmablasts to the mammary gland and accumulation of secretory iga siga antibodies in milk defined as the gut-mammary-siga axis due to an impermeable placenta piglets are born agammaglobulinic and are highly susceptible to a plethora of infectious agents they rely solely on colostrum and milk antibodies for maternal lactogenic immunity previous advances in the development of live and attenuated vaccines for another devastating diarrheal virus of pigs transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev provide insights into the mechanisms of maternal immunity and piglet protection in this chapter we will review previous research on tgev-induced lactogenic immunity to provide a historical perspective on current efforts for pedv control and vaccines in the swine industry identifying factors that influence lactogenic immunity and the gut-mammary-siga axis may lead to improved vaccine regimens for pedv and other enteric pathogens in gestating swine and improved overall herd immunity swine health and industry productivity
background recent studies have clearly demonstrated the enormous virus diversity that exists among wild animals this exemplifies the required expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans methods in the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples n = 42 collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of spain using random pcr in combination with next-generation sequencing samples were collected from american mink neovison vison european mink mustela lutreola european polecat mustela putorius european pine marten martes martes stone marten martes foina eurasian otter lutra lutra and eurasian badger meles meles of the family of mustelidae common genet genetta genetta of the family of viverridae red fox vulpes vulpes of the family of canidae and european wild cat felis silvestris of the family of felidae results a number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected including a theilovirus phleboviruses an amdovirus a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses conclusions using random pcr in combination with next generation sequencing sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal samples collected from spanish carnivores detected novel viruses highlight the viral diversity that is present in fecal material of wild carnivores
toxigenic types of clostridium perfringens are important causes of enteric disease in domestic animals although type e is putatively rare appearing as an uncommon cause of enterotoxemia of lambs calves and rabbits we report here two geographically distinct cases of type e enterotoxemia in calves and diagnostic findings which suggest that type e may play a significant role in enteritis of neonatal calves the cases had many similarities including a history of diarrhea and sudden death abomasitis and hemorrhagic enteritis in both cases anaerobic cultures of abomasum yielded heavy growth of c perfringens genotype e four percent of > 1000 strains of c perfringens from cases of enteritis in domestic animals were type e and all n ¼ 45 were from neonatal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis furthermore type e isolates represented nearly 50% of all isolates submitted from similar clinical cases in calves commercial toxoids available in north america have no label claims for efficacy against type e infections consideration should be given to type e-associated enteritis when planning for the health care of calves r
introduction toxoplasma gondii infections have been reported for many warm-blooded animals around the world including chiropterans however in colombia the country that holds the highest taxonomic richness of this order of mammals in the neotropics up to date there are no reports of t gondii in bats carollia brevicauda purpose the objective of the present study was to detect t gondii dna from internal bat organs from quindío colombia results we report the first detection of t gondii dna from internal bat organs in the department of quindio central andes of colombia out of three silky short tail bat carollia brevicauda specimens collected at the natural reserve "la montaña del ocaso" organs were recovered lungs liver heart kidneys small and large intestine and tested for t gondii through pcr for b1 sequence with 1/3 33.3% positive result for the presence of t gondii dna in bat kidney tissues conclusion taking into consideration the high diversity of bat species in colombia and the complexity of the ecological and functional relationships that these organisms establish in the ecosystems they inhabit we discuss on the urgent need for more detailed research and surveys for toxoplansma in bats and other mammalian wild species
bats are natural reservoirs of several important emerging viruses cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential therefore understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species here we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents another important host group we show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species we identify host traits associated with important reservoir species gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network we identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence
summary：the immune effect of two recombinant protein fragments of spike protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov was investigated in balb/c mice two partial spike gene fragments s1 322-1464 bp and s2 2170-2814 bp of sars coronavirus were amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into pet-23a prokaryotic expression vector then transformed into competent escherichia e coli bl21 de3plyss respectively recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by ni 2+ immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography the purified proteins mixed with complete freund adjuvant were injected into balb/c mice three times at a two-week interval high titer antibody was detected in the serum of immunized balb/c mice and mice immunized with s1 protein produced high titer igg1 igg2a igg2b and igg3 while those immunized with s2 protein produced high titer igg1 igg2a but lower titer igg2b and igg3 serum ifn-γ concentration was increased significantly but the concentrations of il-2 il-4 and il-10 had no significant change and a marked increase was observed in the number of spleen cd8+ t cells the results showed that recombinant proteins of sars coronavirus spike protein induced hormonal and cellular immune response in balb/c mice
porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv are the causative agents of highly fatal acute diarrhea in pigs resulting in enormous losses in the pig industry worldwide to develop an effective bivalent oral vaccine against tgev and pedv infection the d antigenic site of the tgev spike s protein and the major antigen site core neutralizing epitope-coe of the pedv s protein were used as immunogens and the enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp gene was used as a reporter to construct genetically engineered lactobacillus casei rlppg f -t7g10-egfp-6d-coe the expression of proteins of interest by the recombinant l casei was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and a western blot assay and the immunogenicity of rlppg f -t7g10-egfp-6d-coe in orally immunized mice was evaluated the results showed that levels of anti-pedv and anti-tgev serum immunoglobulin g igg and mucosal secreted immunoglobulin a siga antibodies obtained from the mice immunized with rlppg f -t7g10-egfp-6d-coe as well as the proliferation levels of lymphocytes were significantly higher than those in mice orally administered phosphate-buffered saline pbs or rlppg-t7g10 moreover the serum igg antibodies showed neutralizing effects against pedv and tgev our data suggest that the antibiotic resistance-free genetically engineered l casei bivalent oral vaccine provides a safe and promising strategy for vaccine development against pedv and tgev
there is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production here one such alternative namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea pwd which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production a very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption eba chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin g from slaughterhouse pig plasma more than 100 litres resulting in >85% pure pig igg ppigg the ppigg thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains three different types of escherichia coli and one type of salmonella enterica but not towards a fish pathogen yersinia ruckeri and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line ipec-j2 finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an e coli f4+ challenge strain that ppigg given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain reduced the proportion of the bacterial family enterobacteriaceae increased the proportion of families enterococcoceae and streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity conclusively our data support the idea that natural igg directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of pwd and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known
h1n1 swine influenza viruses siv are prevalent in pigs globally and occasionally emerge in humans which raises concern about their pandemic threats to stimulate hemagglutination ha of a/swine/guangdong/lm/2004 h1n1 sw/gd/04 antibody response eukaryotic expression plasmid pci-neo-ha was constructed and used as an immunogen to prepare monoclonal antibodies mabs five mabs designed 8c4 8c6 9d6 8a4 and 8b1 against ha protein were obtained and characterized western blot showed that the 70 kda ha protein could be detected by all mabs in mdck cells infected with sw/gd/04 three mabs-8c4 8c6 and 9d6-have hemagglutination inhibition hi and neutralization test nt activities and 8c6 induces the highest hi and nt titers the protection efficacy of 8c6 was investigated in balb/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of the h1 subtype siv the results indicate that mab 8c6 protected the mice from viral infections especially the homologous strain which was clearly demonstrated by the body weight changes and reduction of viral load thus our findings document for the first time that mab 8c6 might be of potential therapeutic value for h1 subtype siv infection
host shifts where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases they frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species to 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an rna 20 virus drosophila c virus in 19 different species of drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes we found a strong pattern of parallel evolution where viral lineages from the same host 22were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species when we 23 compared viruses that had evolved in different host species we found that parallel genetic changes 24 were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related this suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species this 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease.29
this study was carried out to evaluate the anti-parasitic effect of ursolic acid against toxoplasma gondii t gondii that induces toxoplasmosis particularly in humans the anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against t gondii-infected cells and t gondii were evaluated through different specific assays including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of t gondii when compared with sulfadiazine and consistently induced anti-t gondii activity/effect in particular the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane pvm in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid which was effectively suppressed moreover the survival rate of t gondii was strongly inhibited in t gondii group treated with ursolic acid and then 50% inhibitory concentration ic 50 against t gondii was measured as 94.62 µg/ml the t gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group these results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-t gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of t gondii through the direct and the selective t gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of t gondii-infected mice this study shows that ursolic acid has the potential to be used as a promising anti-t gondii candidate substance for developing effective anti-parasitic drugs
hemorrhagic syndrome in humans but not in its animal host the virus is widely distributed throughout southeastern europe the middle east africa and asia disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses rvsv expressing foreign glycoproteins gp have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers here we developed and assessed a replication competent rvsv vector expressing the cchfv glycoprotein precursor gpc which encodes cchfv structural glycoproteins this construct drives strong expression of cchfv-gp in vitro using these vectors we vaccinated stat-1 knock-out mice an animal model for cchfv the vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of cchfv anti-cchfv-gp igg and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals this study demonstrates that a rvsv expressing only the cchfv-gp has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against cchf infections currently there are several experimental vaccine candidates that have relied on the gpc as an antigenic component which have been evaluated in immunocompromised signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 knock-out stat-1 −/− interferon α/β receptor knock-out ifnar or interferon receptor antibody transiently suppressed is mouse models for cchfv as they recapitulate clinical illness and are uniformly lethal models for cchf . vaccine candidate approaches have focused on either dna expression of cchfv antigens in host tissues replication deficient viral-like particles inactivated whole virus preparations subunit antigen preparations or vectored vaccinia virus vaccines 16 . two of these preparations a prime and boost strategy using modified recombinant vaccinia virus strain ankara encoding the gpc and a prime boost and boost strategy with a dna based vaccine encoding separate np g n and g c antigens have provided promising results with up to 100% protection in the ifnar mouse model for cchfv 23 25 . although cchfv-np by itself as an antigen in the mva vaccine platform has failed to provide protection 26 .recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses rvsv have been developed and evaluated as promising experimental vaccines for several pathogens often requiring only a single-dose to induce protection 27-31 . the rvsv platform has been experimentally evaluated for both durability and safety 32-34 and two rvsv vaccines one for human immunodeficiency virus hiv 35 and a second for zaire ebolavirus ebov have been tested in human clinical trials . for these reasons we hypothesized that rvsv vectors expressing cchfv-gpc could elicit a protective response in a lethal animal model for cchf the aim of our study was to design generate characterize and evaluate a rvsv vector encoding the cchfv-gpc as an experimental vaccine for cchfv
bats are reservoir hosts of several high-impact viruses that cause significant human diseases including nipah virus marburg virus and rabies virus they also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts including sars and mers coronaviruses as is usual with reservoir hosts these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections a lack of reagents methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work these challenges can be addressed in part with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock
since 2010 the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus pedv has caused significant damage to the global pork industry however classical pedv vaccine strains only provide limited protection against emerging strains in this study we successfully isolated and attenuated the pedv epidemic strain zhejiang08 which was characterized by good cell adaptation and high-titer production 48 h post infection in vero e6 cells the attenuated virus induced a high level of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies until 120 days after immunization in piglets and provided complete protection when challenged with an emerging virus strain on day 14 post immunization moreover the capability to activate dendritic cells dcs of this isolate was identified higher expression levels of il-12 and ifn-c were recorded in dcs after treatment with zhejiang08 for 24 h furthermore genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high homology between the main antigen epitopes of zhejiang08 and pedv pandemic isolates following 2011 combining the glycosylation site prediction results and their distribution within the spatial structure of the s protein led to the conclusion that the observed more effective host immune response of zhejiang08 compared to cv777 was possibly associated with a lack of the potential glycosylation site in the 296 amino acids of the s protein in summary we illustrated that the attenuated virus represents a promising vaccine candidate
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by sfts virus sftsv infection despite a gradual increase of sfts cases and high mortality in endemic regions no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available here we developed a single recombinant plasmid dna encoding sftsv genes gn and gc together with np-ns fusion antigen as a vaccine candidate the viral antigens were fused with fmslike tyrosine kinase-3 ligand flt3l and il-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to enhance cell-mediated immunity vaccination with the dna provides complete protection of ifnar ko mice upon lethal sftsv challenge whereas immunization with a plasmid without il-12 gene resulted in partial protection since we failed to detect antibodies against surface glycoproteins gn and gc in the immunized mice antigen-specific cellular immunity as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific t cell responses might play major role in protection finally we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein immunization of the individual glycoprotein gn or gc although both protein antigens induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against sftsv gn vaccination resulted in relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than gc vaccination however both antigens failed to provide complete protection given that dna vaccines have failed to induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines optimal combinations of dna and protein elements proper selection of target antigens and incorporation of efficient adjuvant need to be further investigated for sftsv vaccine development

the successful use of any adenoviral vectors is predicated upon the use of a serotype that is not neutralized by circulating antibodies however efforts to develop a diverse repertoire of serologically distinct adenovirus vectors may be hindered by the necessity to generate cell lines to allow for the successful propagation of vectors deleted of essential genes a strategy to construct chimeric adenoviruses whereby the rescue and propagation of an e1-deleted hadv-b-derived adenoviral vector can be achieved using existing cell lines such as hek 293 is reported it is further shown that this strategy may be more widely applicable

emerging infectious diseases are major threats to human health most severe viral disease outbreaks occur in developing regions where health conditions are poor with increased international travel and business the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing the most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination however vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases viruslike particles vlps are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades vlps are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles vlps have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material vlp vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines studies have shown that vlp vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses which may offer effective antiviral protection here we review recent developments with vlp-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases the infectious agents discussed include rna viruses from different virus families such as the arenaviridae bunyaviridae caliciviridae coronaviridae filoviridae flaviviridae orthomyxoviridae paramyxoviridae and togaviridae families
central nervous system cns viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide but the systematic survey of patients admitted to hospitals with cns infections in many countries including indonesia is limited to obtain more information regarding the causes of cns infections in indonesia this study was performed to detect and identify viral agents associated with cns infections amongst in-patients at a referral hospital in manado north sulawesi indonesia adult patients admitted to r d kandou general hospital with presumed cns infection were enrolled cerebrospinal fluid serum and throat swab samples were collected and tested using molecular serological and virus isolation assays a confirmed viral etiology was established in three and a probable/possible in 11 out of 74 patients the most common was herpes simplex virus 1 7/74 9.5% followed by epstein-barr virus 2/74 2.7% cytomegalovirus 1/74 1.4% enterovirus d68 1/74 1.4% rhinovirus a 1/74 1.4% dengue virus 1/64 1.6% and japanese encephalitis virus 1/64 1.6%. there were 20 fatal cases 27.0% during hospitalization in which eight were associated with viral causes we identified herpes simplex virus 1 as the most common cause of cns infection among adults in north sulawesi with most of the cases remaining undiagnosed our study highlights the challenges in establishing the etiology of viral cns infections and the importance of using a wide range of molecular and serological detection methods to identify cns viruses
vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infection and controlling the spread of ibv but currently available inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines have some disadvantages we developed a chimeric virus-like particle vlp-based candidate vaccine for ibv protection the chimeric vlp was composed of matrix 1 protein from avian influenza h5n1 virus and a fusion protein neuraminidase na/spike 1 s1 that was generated by fusing ibv s1 protein to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of na protein of avian influenza h5n1 virus the chimeric vlps elicited significantly higher s1-specific antibody responses in intramuscularly immunized mice and chickens than inactivated ibv viruses furthermore the chimeric vlps induced significantly higher neutralization antibody levels than inactivated h120 virus in spf chickens finally the chimeric vlps induced significantly higher il-4 production in mice these results demonstrate that chimeric vlps have the potential for use in vaccines against ibv infection
vaccine development has had a huge impact on human health however there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential this review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1 the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines and 2 the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation nanoparticle-based vaccines including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development these include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells enable cross-protection against divergent strains act as adjuvants or immunomodulators allow for sustained release of antigen enable single dose delivery and potentially obviate the cold chain while mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic an overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections with advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed taken together advances in nanotechnology combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections
containing 36 ppm germanium the present study was conducted to better understand the effects of gb on immune responses in a mouse model and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases in the mouse model dietary supplementation with gb enhanced concanavalin a cona-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of cd3+cd8+ t lymphocytes in pigs experimentally infected with prrsv viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the gb-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that gb-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with prrsv infection compared to the control group indicating that gb promotes prrsv clearance these antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of gb to increase cd3+cd8+ t lymphocyte production observed in the mice hence this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease keywords germanium biotite immune enhancement porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 136 bock-gie jung et al
infection of balb/c mice with mouse hepatitis virus strain jhm mhv-jhm at any of several intervals relative to ovalbumin ova administration resulted in elevated ova-specific igg 2 a titers since gamma interferon ifn has been implicated as an up-regulator of igg 2 a production attempts were made to determine whether levels of this cytokine were modified in sera of infected mice serum ifn-y was not detected but treatment of mhv-jhminfected mice with monoclonal anti-ifn- antibody resulted in high mortality with decreased survival times enhanced virus titers in liver and spleen and more severe virus-associated pathology compared to mock-treated infected mice immunotherapy with recombinant ifn-7 ameliorated disease as reflected by mortality rates and virus titers in target organs
dromedary or one-humped camels camelus dromedarius are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk currently there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels with highest numbers in africa and the middle east the hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them especially as a stable protein source camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals the ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species we conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications 65% focused on middle east respiratory syndrome mers brucellosis echinococcus granulosus and rift valley fever the high fatality from mers outbreaks during 2012-2016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of mers-related publications however we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as yersinia pestis coxiella burnetii and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts camel populations particularly in sub-saharan africa are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts and thus the risk of zoonoses increases as well in this review we provide an overview of the major zoonotic diseases present in dromedary camels their risk to humans and recommendations to minimize spillover events
ducks play an important role in transmitting and maintaining mammalian viruses in nature and are a reservoir host of many animal viruses we analyzed the fecal virome of four strains a b c and d of ducks living in isolation by using metagenomic analysis the feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal virus families the percentage values of rna virus reads compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% a 97.30% b 98.01 c and 67.49% d and were mainly from orthomyxoviridae mimiviridae bunyaviridae picobirnaviridae and reoviridae meanwhile the minority of dna virus reads were related to herpesviridae adenoviridae iridoviridae and other low abundance viral families the percentage values of orthomyxoviridae mimiviridae bunyaviridae picobirnaviridae and herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains a b and c however there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain d in summary this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present these results can be used as a reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential
pseudorabies virus prv a member of the herpesviridae is the causative agent of an acute infectious disease in a variety of animals the emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains therefore the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies in this study we found that germacrone one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from rhizoma curcuma was able to effectively inhibit prv replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro germacrone showed antiviral activity against prv in the early phase of the viral replication cycle moreover we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus nor does it affect the expression of the prv receptor protein nectin-1 nectin-2 and cd155 our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant prv
more recently emerging strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv cause severe diarrhea and especially high mortality rates in infected piglets leading to substantial economic loss to worldwide swine industry these outbreaks urgently call for updated and effective pedv vaccines better understanding in pedv biology and improvement in technological platforms for virus production can immensely assist and accelerate pedv vaccine development in this study we explored the ability of pedv nucleocapsid n protein in improving viral yields in cell culture systems we demonstrated that pedv n expression positively affected both recovery of pedv from infectious clones and pedv propagation in cell culture compared to vero e6 cells vero e6 cells expressing pedv n could accelerate growth of a slow-growing pedv strain to higher peak titers by 12 hours or enhance the yield of a vaccine candidate strain by two orders of magnitude interestingly pedv n also slightly enhances replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus a pedv relative in the nidovirales order these results solidify the importance of n in pedv recovery and propagation and suggest a potentially useful consideration in designing vaccine production platforms for pedv or closely related pathogens
interest in the potential of monoclonal antibodies mabs to serve as therapeutic agents has surged in the past decade with a major emphasis on human viral diseases there has been much attention in this area directed towards the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 hiv-1 and promising research developments have emerged on the inhibition of hiv-1 infection by mabs and the identification of several highly conserved neutralizing epitopes more recently potent fully-human neutralizing mabs have been developed against a variety of important human viral disease agents including the paramyxoviruses hendra virus and nipah virus and human or humanized mabs have been developed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and west nile virus among others most of these more recently developed antiviral mabs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies and the implementation of simplified inexpensive yet efficient methods for expressing and purifying the initially selected fragment antibodies is of prime importance in further facilitating this area of research
foot-and-mouth disease fmd is an economically significant animal disease because of the speed of its transmission the current fmd vaccine provides no protection until 7 days after the vaccination which reduces its effectiveness in the case of an outbreak therefore to find an alternative method of applying antiviral agents for rapid and enhanced inhibition of the fmd virus fmdv we compared the antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents and attempted to apply them in combination first we measured and compared the 50% effective concentration ec 50 to the mean inhibition effects of fmdv and the 50% cytotoxic concentration cc 50 to the mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents such as ribavirin guanidine-hydrochloride guanidine-hcl 6-azauridine and recombinant adenovirus expressing three small interference rnas ad-sirna or porcine interferon-a ad-porcine ifn-a in swine kidney cells ibrs-2 the selectivity indices of ribavirin 35.2 and 6-azauridine 34.6 were higher than that of guanidine-hcl 26.9 the selectivity indices of ad-sirna or ad-porcine ifn-a were 7 â 10 3 or 7 â 10 4 based on the adenoviral titer next we tested the combined effects of the fmdv inhibition agents enhanced inhibition effects were observed in the ibrs-2 cells and in suckling mice from the combination of ad-porcine ifn-a and ad-sirna or ribavirin the combined application of these recombinant adenoviruses and ribavirin may enhance their inhibitory effect on fmdv and overcome fmdv resistance against antiviral agents abbreviations cpe cytopathic effect cc50 cytotoxic concentration required to reduce cell viability by 50% ec50 effective concentration required to reduce virusinduced cytopathogenicity by 50% fmd foot-and-mouth disease fmdv foot-andmouth disease virus guanidine-hcl guanidine hydrochloride ifn interferon ip intraperitoneal sd standard deviation sirna small interference rna shrna short hairpin rna rnai rna interference rt-pcr reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tcid 50 50% tissue culture infective dose dpc days post challenge p i post infection ld 50 50% lethal dose
astroviruses are recognized as a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and animals they are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases such as hepatitis in ducklings nephritis in chickens and encephalitis in cattle in february 2017 a fatal infection of goslings characterized by visceral urate deposition was reported in the shandong province china our systematic investigation led to the isolation of an astrovirus designated aastv/goose/chn/2017/sd01 and similar disease was reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings fulfilling koch's postulates the isolated astrovirus replicated well and resulted in 100% mortality of goose embryos complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and closely related to members of the avastrovirus genogroup ii experimental infection showed that the isolate was highly pathogenic in goslings causing clinical signs growth repression and in many cases mortality histopathological examination indicated that lesions occurred mainly in the kidneys of infected birds however virus-specific genomic rna was detected in all representative tissues and virus shedding was detected up to 12 days after inoculation suggesting that the isolate was able to spread systemically and replicate efficiently in vivo collectively our study demonstrates for the first time the etiological role of a genetically distinct astrovirus in the fatal infection of goslings
mucosal vaccination offers great advantage for inducing protective immune response to prevent viral transmission and dissemination here we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia ankara mva and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia tian tan mvtt for inducing neutralizing antibodies nabs via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice mvtt is an attenuated variant of the wild-type vtt which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of chinese people the spike glycoprotein s of sars-cov was used as the test antigen after the s gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates mvtt-s and mva-s using identical doses mvtt-s induced lower levels 2-3-fold of anti-sars-cov neutralizing antibodies nabs than mva-s through intramuscular inoculation mvtt-s however was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of nabs than mva-s when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes these levels of mvtt-s-induced nab responses were substantially 10-fold higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments moreover pre-exposure to the wild-type vtt via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the nab response via the same routes of mvtt-s vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-vtt nab response the efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination however was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type vtt our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-vtt nabs after historical smallpox vaccination mvtt is therefore an attractive live viral vector for mucosal vaccination
the infectious dose of a virus pool of original us pedv strain pc22a was determined in 4-day-old cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived cdcd piglets the median pig diarrhea dose pdd 50 of the virus pool was determined as 7.35 log 10 pdd 50 /ml similar to the cell culture infectious titer 7.75 log 10 plaque-forming units pfu/ml 100 pdd 50 caused watery diarrhea in all conventional suckling piglets n = 12 derived from a pedv-naive sow whereas 1000 and 10 000 pdd 50 did not cause diarrhea in piglets derived from two pedv-field exposed-recovered sows this information is important for future pedv challenge studies and validation of pedv vaccines
most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin while zoonotic diseases originate from a reservoir most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes either exclusively humans or exclusively animals without considering the importance of animal to human transmission i e spillover transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks we propose a simple continuous time stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir e g humans by a zoonotic species considering two modes of transmission 1 animal-to-human and 2 human-to-human the model assumes that i epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that ii an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left the results show that during an epidemic even when the pathogens are barely contagious multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission overall the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host
cryptosporidium spp in diarrheic calves less than 30 days old from farms across northern ireland were examined over a year period by microscopic genotyping and subtyping techniques to characterize the transmission dynamics cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 291 of 779 37.4% animals the prevalence rates of rotavirus coronavirus and escherichia coli k99+ were lower as seen in 242 of 806 30.0% 46/806 5.7% and 16/421 3.8% of animals respectively of the 224 cryptosporidiumpositive specimens available for molecular analysis cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 213 95.1% specimens cryptosporidium bovis in eight 3.6% and cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in three 1.3%. sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene identified 16 iia subtypes and a new subtype family with 120 of the 216 55.6% positive specimens having the subtype iiaa18g3r1 eight of the iia subtypes were previously seen in humans in northern ireland several subtypes were temporally or geographically unique the genetic diversity in calves in northern ireland was much greater than that reported from other areas this work demonstrates the utility of genotyping and subtyping tools in characterizing the transmission of cryptosporidium spp in calves and humans

pleomorphic virus-like particles have been observed by electron microscopy in the faeces of children and adults with diarrhoea some of these particles were approximately 100 nm in diameter and had a "fringe" of closely applied peplomers approximately 10 nm long they closely resembled berne virus of horses and breda virus of calves the two representatives of a newly proposed family called the toroviridae in one sample a toroidal nucleoprotein-like structure was observed within the particles for two samples a buoyant density of 1.14 g/ml was determined by centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient one sample possessed a haemagglutinin for rat erythrocytes the serological relationship between these different viruses was observed by immune electron microscopy haemagglutination inhibition and serum neutralisation the role of these viruslike particles as candidate pathogens of humans is discussed
rabies virus rabv and other lyssaviruses can cause rabies and rabies-like diseases which are a persistent public health threat to humans and other mammals lyssaviruses exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of geographical distribution and host specificity indicative of a long-standing diversification to adapt to the environment however the evolutionary diversity of lyssaviruses in terms of codon usage is still unclear we found that rabv has the lowest codon usage bias among lyssaviruses strains evidenced by its high mean effective number of codons enc 53.84 ± 0.35 moreover natural selection is the driving force in shaping the codon usage pattern of these strains in summary our study sheds light on the codon usage patterns of lyssaviruses which can aid in the development of control strategies and experimental research
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide high genetic diversity among prrsv strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination mosaic dna and vaccinia vacv vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous prrsv strains methods piglets were primed and boosted with gp5-mosaic dna vaccine and recombinant gp5-mosaic vacv rgp5-mosaic vacv respectively pigs vaccinated with rgp5-wt vr2332 dna and rgp5-wt vacv or empty vector dna and empty vacv respectively served as controls virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with vr2332 or mn184c necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge results vaccination with the gp5-mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both vr2332 and mn184c prrsv strains in contrast vaccination of animals with the gp5-wt vaccines induced responses only to vr2332 furthermore vaccination with the gp5-mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum tissues porcine alveolar macrophages pams and bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluids and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either mn184c or vr2332 which have only 85% identity in contrast significant protection by the gp5-wt based vaccines was only achieved against the vr2332 strain conclusions gp5-mosaic vaccines using a dna-prime/vacv boost regimen conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses
an important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses subunit vaccines virus-like particles vlps dna vaccines heterologous expression systems and vaccines derived from sars-cov genome by reverse genetics this review describes several aspects essential to develop sars-cov vaccines such as the correlates of protection virus serotypes vaccination side effects and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars-cov genome the production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent sars has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses that in general has been less successful after preclinical trials in animal models efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans
veterinary vaccines have had and continue to have a major role in protecting animal health and public health reducing animal suffering enabling efficient production of food animals to feed the burgeoning human population and greatly reducing the need for antibiotics to treat food and companion animals prominent examples include rabies vaccines and rinderpest vaccines rabies vaccines for domestic animals and wildlife have nearly eliminated human rabies in developed countries thanks to the global rinderpest eradication program which involves vaccination trade restrictions and surveillance rinderpest may soon become only the second disease after smallpox to be globally eradicated successful examples of new technology animal vaccines that are licensed for use include gene-deleted marker vaccines virus-like-particle vaccines recombinant modified live virus vaccines chimeric vaccines and dna vaccines animal vaccines also use a wide variety of novel adjuvants that are not yet approved for use in human vaccines animal vaccines can be developed and licensed much more quickly than human vaccines the west nile virus was discovered in the united states in august 1999 by august 2001 an equine vaccine for west nile virus was conditionally licensed for animal vaccines to effectively protect animal and public health they must be widely used which means they must be affordable the regulatory process must meet the need for assuring safety and efficacy without increasing the cost of licensing and production to the point where they are not affordable to the end user
bartonella infections were investigated in seven species of bats from four regions of the republic of georgia of the 236 bats that were captured 212 90% specimens were tested for bartonella infection colonies identified as bartonella were isolated from 105 49.5% of 212 bats phylogenetic analysis based on sequence variation of the glta gene differentiated 22 unique bartonella genogroups genetic distances between these diverse genogroups were at the level of those observed between different bartonella species described previously twenty-one reference strains from 19 representative genogroups were characterized using four additional genetic markers host specificity to bat genera or families was reported for several bartonella genogroups some bartonella genotypes found in bats clustered with those identified in dogs from thailand and humans from poland bacteria of the genus bartonella parasitize erythrocytes and endothelial cells of a wide range of mammals and recently were reported in bats from africa asia america and northern europe a human disease case in the usa was associated with a novel bartonella species which later was identified in bats in finland this human case has demonstrated the zoonotic potential of bat-borne bartonella and underscores the need for extended surveillance and studies of these pathogens the present work assesses prevalence and diversity of bartonella in bats in the country of georgia southern caucasus characterizes reference strains representing diverse genogroups by variation of genetic loci and evaluates the links between identified bartonella genogroups and bat hosts importantly some bartonella genotypes found in bats were close or identical to those identified in dogs and humans the data indicate that the public health impact of bartonella carried by bats should be investigated plos neglected tropical diseases | https//doi
respiratory viral infections are strongly associated with asthma exacerbations rhinovirus is most frequently-detected pathogen followed by respiratory syncytial virus metapneumovirus parainfluenza virus enterovirus and coronavirus in addition viral infection in combination with genetics allergen exposure microbiome and other pathogens may play a role in asthma development in particular asthma development has been linked to wheezing-associated respiratory viral infections in early life to understand underlying mechanisms of viral-induced airways disease investigators have studied respiratory viral infections in small animals this report reviews animal models of human respiratory viral infection employing mice rats guinea pigs hamsters and ferrets investigators have modeled asthma exacerbations by infecting mice with allergic airways disease asthma development has been modeled by administration of virus to immature animals small animal models of respiratory viral infection will identify cell and molecular targets for the treatment of asthma
most of the modern techniques used for identification of viral-induced disease are based on identification of viral antigens and/or nucleic acids in patient's blood diagnosis in the field or in remote locations can be challenging and alternatively samples are shipped to diagnostic labs for testing shipments must occur under controlled temperature conditions to prevent loss of sample integrity we have tested the ability of magnetic nanotrap ® nt particles to improve stability and detection of venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev viral capsid protein and viral genomic rna in whole human blood at elevated temperature and prolonged storage conditions nt particles have previously been shown to capture and enrich multiple pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus influenza virus coronavirus and rift valley fever virus our study indicates that samples incubated with nt particles had detectable levels of infectious veev in blood equal to or greater than samples without nt treatment across all temperatures viral rna detection was increased in the presence of nt particles at later time points 72 h and higher temperature 40 • c conditions likewise detection of veev capsid protein was enhanced in the presence of nt particles up to 72 h at 40 • c finally we intranasally infected c3h mice with tc-83 the live attenuated vaccine strain of veev and demonstrated that nt particles could substantially increase the detection of veev capsid in infected blood incubated up to 72 h at 40 • c samples without nt particles had undetectable capsid protein levels taken together our data demonstrate the ability of nt particles to preserve and enable detection of veev in human and mouse blood samples over time and at elevated temperatures
allergic reactions after vaccination are considered as an important practical problem in dogs however their immunological mechanism has not been well understood the present study was designed to investigate the relationship between ige reactivity to the vaccines and immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs sera from 10 dogs that developed immediatetype allergic reactions such as circulatory collapse cyanosis dyspnea facial edema and vomiting within 1 h after vaccination with non-rabies monovalent or combined vaccines and sera from 50 dogs that did not develop allergic reactions after vaccination were collected serum ige reactivity to the injected vaccines was measured by fluorometric elisa using a mouse monoclonal anti-dog ige antibody then ige reactivity to fetal calf serum fcs and stabilizer proteins gelatin casein and peptone included in the vaccines was measured in sera that had high levels of ige to the vaccines levels of serum specific ige to the vaccines in dogs with immediate-type allergic reactions 59-4173 fluorescence units mean ae s d 992.5 ae 1181.9 fu were significantly higher than those in control dogs 92.4 ae 43.3 fu p < 0.001 of the eight dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions and had high levels of serum specific ige to the vaccines seven had specific ige directed to fcs the ige reactivity to the vaccines in sera from these dogs was almost completely inhibited by fcs the other one dog had serum ige directed to gelatin and casein included in the vaccine as stabilizers the results obtained in this study suggest that immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs were induced by type i hypersensitivity mediated by ige directed to vaccine components in addition fcs gelatin and casein included in vaccines could be the causative allergens that induced immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs #
the pandemic outbreak and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 20 coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is not only a threat for humans but potentially also for many 21 animals research has revealed that sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses have been transmitted 22 from animals to humans and vice versa and across animal species and hence attracted public 23 attention concerning host-virus interactions and transmission ways non-human primates nhps 24 as our evolutionary closest relatives are susceptible to human viruses and a number of 25 pathogens are known to circulate between humans and nhps here we generated global statistics 26 of virus infection in nhps vi-nhps in total 121 nhp species from 14 families have been 27 reported to be infected by 139 dna and rna viruses from 23 virus families 74.8 percent of 28 viruses in nhps have also been found in humans indicative of the high potential for cross 29 species transmission of these viruses the top ten nhp species with high centrality in the 30 nhp-virus network are two apes pan troglodytes pongo pygmaeus seven old world monkeys 31 macaca mulatta m fascicularis papio cynocephalus lophocebus albigena chlorocebus 32 aethiops cercopithecus ascanius c nictitans and a lemur propithecus diadema besides apes 33 there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and old world monkeys given the wide 34 distribution of many old world monkey species and their frequent contact with humans we 35 suggest epidemiological investigations in nhps specifically in old world monkeys with close 36 contact to humans and other effective measures to prevent this potential circular transmission 37 38 39
h7n9 avian influenza virus aiv caused human infections in 2013 in china phylogenetic analyses indicate that h7n9 aiv is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential we conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis vaccine development and diagnosis of h7n9 aiv infection in humans we followed prisma guidelines and searched pubmed web of science and google scholar to identify relevant articles published between january 2013 and december 2018 pathogenesis data indicated that h7n9 aiv belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species however h7n9 induces high mortality in humans sporadic human infections have recently been reported caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry h7n9 aivs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia multiorgan dysfunction and cytokine dysregulation however mechanisms via which the virus induces severe
the induction of antigen specific memory cd8 + t cells in vivo is very important to new vaccines against infectious diseases in the present study we aimed to evaluate the immune responses of peptide-specific cd8 + t cells induced by hla-a*0201 restricted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov s epitopes plus cpg oligodeoxynucleotide cpg odn polyic and r848 as adjuvants furthermore the generation distribution and phenotype of long-lasting peptide-specific memory cd8 + t cells were assessed by elisa elispot and flow cytometry our results showed that antigen specific cd8 + t cells were elicited by hla-a*0201 restricted sars-cov s epitopes furthermore the frequency of peptide-specific cd8 + t cells was dramatically increased after both prime and boost immunization with peptides plus cpg odn whereas slight enhancements were induced following boost vaccination with peptides plus polyic or r848 sars-cov s peptide-specific ifn-␥ + cd8 + t cells were distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues results also demonstrated that the hla-a*0201 restricted peptide-specific cd8 + t cells induced by peptides plus cpg odn carried a memory cell phenotype with cd45rb + and cd62l − and possessed long-term survival ability in vivo taken together our results implied that hla-a*0201 restricted sars-cov s epitopes plus cpg odn might be the superior candidates for sars vaccine
the mosquito-borne japanese encephalitis virus jev causes serious illness worldwide that is associated with high morbidity and mortality currently there are no effective drugs approved for the treatment of jev infection drug-repurposing screening is an alternative approach to discover potential antiviral agents in this study high-content screening hcs of a natural extracts library was performed and two hit fda-approved na ϩ /k ϩ -atpase inhibitors ouabain and digoxin were identified as having robust efficiency against jev infection with the selectivity indexes over 1000 the results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the jev infection at the replication stage by targeting the na ϩ /k ϩ -atpase furthermore it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by jev in a balb/c mouse model this work demonstrated that na ϩ /k ϩ -atpase could serve as the target of treatment of jev infection and ouabain has the potential to be developed as an effective anti-jev drug
most coronaviruses infecting humans cause mild diseases whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus is an extremely dangerous pathogen here we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses hcovs based on recombinant nucleocapsid n proteins of all known pathogenic strains 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 sars the novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different hcovs in a single experiment for assay evaluation serum samples from persons infected with 229e or oc43 acute/convalescent recovered sars patients and healthy donors were analyzed screening for nucleocapsid n-specific immunoglobulin g igg in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity with this new technique we found that recently identified nl63 and hku1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections possibly cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229e and oc43 serum pairs however the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing sars-positive serum samples where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other hcovs was not observed this coronavirus strain-specific line immunoassay represents a powerful tool for serologic diagnostics
highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai viruses of the h5n1 subtype often cause severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure in humans with reported case fatality rates of more than 60%. to develop a clinical antibody therapy we generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody mab ch61 that showed strong neutralizing activity against h5n1 hpai viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of h5n1 hpai virus infections passive immunization with mab ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge in a cynomolgus macaque model reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with mab ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge protective effects were also noted in macaques under immunosuppression though mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by mab ch61 were recovered from macaques treated with this mab alone combined treatment with mab ch61 and peramivir reduced the emergence of escape mutants our results indicate that antibody therapy might be beneficial in reducing viral loads and delaying disease progression during h5n1 hpai virus infection in clinical cases and combined treatment with other antiviral compounds should improve the protective effects of antibody therapy against h5n1 hpai virus infection
in as short as 3 months covid-19 has spread and ravaged the world in an unprecedented speed in modern history rivaling the 1918 flu pandemic sars-cov-2 the culprit virus is highly contagious and stable in the environment and predominantly transmits among humans via the respiratory route accumulating evidence suggest that this virus like many of its related viruses may also be an enteric virus that can spread via the fecal-oral route such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapidity and proliferation of this pandemic here we briefly summarize what is known about this family of viruses and literature basis of the hypothesis that sars-cov-2 is capable of infecting the gastrointestinal tract and shedding in the environment for potential human-to-human transmission
understanding the determinants of adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 is critical for fighting the ongoing covid-19 pandemic here we assayed both antibody and t-cell reactivity to sars-cov-2 antigens in covid-19 convalescent patients and healthy donors sampled before and during the pandemic our results show that while anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies can distinguish convalescent patients from healthy donors the magnitude of t-cell response was more pronounced in healthy donors sampled during covid-19 pandemic than in donors sampled before the outbreak this hints at the possibility that some individuals have encountered the virus but were protected by t-cell cross-reactivity observed a public and diverse t-cell response was observed for two a*02-restricted sars-cov-2 epitopes revealing a set of t-cell receptor motifs displaying germline-encoded features bulk cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell response to sars-cov-2 glycoprotein s is characterized by multiple groups of homologous t-cell receptor sequences some of which are shared across multiple donors indicating the existence of immunodominant epitopes overall our findings indicate that t cells form an efficient response to sars-cov-2 and alongside the antibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying sars-cov-2 exposure and immunity we hope that data including the set of specific tcell receptors identified in this study can serve as a basis for future developments of sars-cov-2 vaccinations and monitoring
hantaviruses are among the most important zoonotic pathogens of humans and the subject of heightened global attention despite the importance of hantaviruses for public health there is no consensus on their evolutionary history and especially the frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species virus transmission documenting the extent of hantavirus biodiversity and particularly their range of mammalian hosts is critical to resolving this issue here we describe four novel hantaviruses huangpi virus lianghe virus longquan virus and yakeshi virus sampled from bats and shrews in china and which are distinct from other known hantaviruses huangpi virus was found in pipistrellus abramus lianghe virus in anourosorex squamipes longquan virus in rhinolophus affinis rhinolophus sinicus and rhinolophus monoceros and yakeshi virus in sorex isodon respectively a phylogenetic analysis of the available diversity of hantaviruses reveals the existence of four phylogroups that infect a range of mammalian hosts as well as the occurrence of ancient reassortment events between the phylogroups notably the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts suggesting that cross-species transmission has played a major role during hantavirus evolution and at all taxonomic levels although we also noted some evidence for virus-host co-divergence our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that hantaviruses might have first appeared in chiroptera bats or soricomorpha moles and shrews before emerging in rodent species overall these data indicate that bats are likely to be important natural reservoir hosts of hantaviruses
most traditional vaccines are composed either of a whole pathogen or its parts these vaccines however are not always effective and can even be harmful as such additional agents known as adjuvants are necessary to increase vaccine safety and efficacy this review summarizes the potential of biodegradable materials including synthetic and natural polymers for vaccine delivery these materials are highly biocompatible and have minimal toxicity and most biomaterial-based vaccines delivering antigens or adjuvants have been shown to improve immune response compared to formulations consisting of the antigen alone therefore these materials can be applied in modern vaccine development
negative staining electron microscopy was used to identify viruses in 157 normal and 29 diarrhoeal faecal samples collected from 156 dogs admitted to an animal shelter during an 8 month period march to october in 1982 seven distinct viral types were detected 21-26 nm parvovirus-like particles 28-31 nm astrovirus-like particles a previously undescribed 34-35 nm "round" virus particle coronavirus coronavirus-like particles cvlp rotavirus and papova-like virus parvovirus-like particles alone were detected in 14 diarrhoeal and 50 normal faeces astrovirus-like particles in 3 normal faeces "round" viruses in 4 normal faeces coronavirus in 2 diarhoeal and 5 normal faeces cvlp in one diarrhoeal and one normal faeces rotavirus in 2 normal faeces papova-like virus in one normal faeces both parvovirus-like particles and coronavirus in 2 diarrhoeal and 2 normal faeces parvovirus-like particles and rotavirus in one normal faeces and parvovirus-like and papova-like virus in one normal faeces the significance of these findings in canine and human disease is discussed
the family astroviridae consists of two genera avastrovirus and mamastrovirus whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts respectively in this study we report the first detection of astrovirus from fecal specimens of wild boars sus scrofa using viral metagenomics and complete genome sequencing the wild boar astrovirus wbastv-1/2011/ hun jq340310 genome is 6707 nucleotide long and had 76% 95% and 56% amino acid aa identity in the orf1a 852aa orf1b 522aa and orf2 845aa regions respectively to porcine astrovirus 4 pastv-4 jf713713 the closest match this study indicates that wild boar could be a reservoir for astroviruses
chikungunya virus chikv has caused extensive outbreaks in several countries within the americas asia oceanic/pacific islands and europe in humans chikv infections cause a debilitating disease with acute febrile illness and long-term polyarthralgia acute and chronic symptoms impose a major economic burden to health systems and contribute to poverty in affected countries an efficacious vaccine would be an important step towards decreasing the disease burden caused by chikv infection despite no licensed vaccine is yet available for chikv there is strong evidence of effective asymptomatic viral clearance due to neutralising antibodies against the viral structural proteins we have designed viral-vectored vaccines to express the structural proteins of chikv using the replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral platform chadox1 expression of the chikv antigens results in the formation of chikungunya virus-like particles our vaccines induce high frequencies of anti-chikungunya specific t-cell responses as well as high titres of anti-chikv e2 antibodies with high capacity for in vitro neutralisation our results indicate the potential for further clinical development of the chadox1 vaccine platform in chikv vaccinology
two fragments s66 and s55 of the s glycoprotein of the newly identified canine coronavirus type i ccov type i were expressed in a procariotic system the purified recombinant proteins of 350 and 366 amino acids in length respectively were employed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for the detection of ccov type i antibodies in dog sera four canine sera-positive for ccov type ii four sera-positive for ccov type i and 10 negative control sera were examined only the sera-positive for ccov type i strongly reacted with both the proteins whereas the sera-positive for ccov type ii showed low reactivity in the elisa test as ccov type i seems to be not cultivable in cell cultures the recombinant fragments of the s protein represent a unique method to study preliminarily the immunological and the pathogenetic characteristics of this new virus
south-east asia is a hot spot for emerging zoonotic diseases and bats have been recognized as hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars responsible for acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks thus it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans coronaviruses covs have been reported in bat species from thailand china indonesia taiwan and the philippines however no such work was conducted in cambodia or lao pdr between 2010 and 2013 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries they were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-pcr assay a total of 93 samples 4.7% from 17 genera of bats tested positive sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus αcov and beta-cov βcov respectively the βcovs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human such as sars-cov and mers-cov all coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats family pteropodidae n = 55 clustered with other bat βcovs of lineage d whereas one coronavirus from pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage c of βcovs which also includes the mers-cov αcovs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat αcov sequences previously published a closely related strain of pedv responsible for severe diarrhea in pigs pedv-cov was detected in 2 myotis bats we highlighted the presence and the high diversity of coronaviruses circulating in bats from cambodia and lao pdr three new bat genera and species were newly identified as host of coronaviruses namely macroglossus sp megaerops niphanae and myotis horsfieldii
fowl typhoid ft a septicemic disease caused by salmonella gallinarum sg and infectious bronchitis ib are two economically important avian diseases that affect poultry industry worldwide herein we exploited a live attenuated sg mutant jol967 to deliver spike s protein 1 of ib virus v to elicit protective immunity against both ft and ib in chickens the codon optimized s1 nucleotide sequence was cloned in-frame into a prokaryotic constitutive expression vector pjhl65 subsequently empty pjhl65 or recombinant pjhl65-s1 plasmid was electroporated into jol967 and the resultant clones were designated as jol2068 and jol2077 respectively our results demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated once orally with jol2077 elicited significantly p < 0.05 higher ibv-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity compared to jol2068 and pbs control groups consequently on challenge with the virulent ibv strain at 28 th day post-vaccination jol2077 vaccinated birds displayed significantly p < 0.05 lower inflammatory lesions in virus-targeted tissues compared to control groups furthermore 33.3% 2 of 6 of birds vaccinated with jol2077 vaccine had shown virus recovery from tracheal tissues compared to 100% 6 of 6 recovery obtained in both the control groups against wild-type sg lethal challenge both jol2077 and jol2068 vaccinated groups exhibited only 10% mortality compared to 80% mortality observed in pbs control group in conclusion we show that jol2077 can induce efficient ibv-and carrier-specific protective immunity and can act as a bivalent vaccine against ft and ib further studies are warranted to investigate the potential of jol2077 vaccine in broiler and young layer birds.© the authors 2018 this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http//creat iveco mmons .org/licen ses/by/4.0/ which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made the creative commons public domain dedication waiver
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv causes chronic economically devastating disease in pigs of all ages frequent mutations in the viral genome result in viruses with immune escape mutants irrespective of regular vaccination control of prrsv remains a challenge to swine farmers in prrsv-infected pigs innate cytokine ifn-α is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed to elucidate both cellular and innate cytokine responses at very early stages of prrsv infection seven weeks old pigs maintained on a commercial pig farm were infected and analyzed results one pig in a pen containing 25 pigs was prrsv infected and responses from this pig and one penmate were assessed two days later all the infected and a few of the contact neighbor pigs were viremic at day 2 postinfection approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity and nearly a 1-fold increase in ifn-α production was detected in blood of a few pigs enhanced secretion of il-4 iñ 90% il-12 in~40% and il-10 in~20% but not ifn-γ in prrsv infected pigs was observed in addition reduced frequency of myeloid cells cd4 -cd8 + t cells and cd4 + cd8 + t cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural t regulatory cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs interestingly all viremic contact pigs also had comparable immune cell modulations conclusion replicating prrsv in both infected and contact pigs was found to be responsible for rapid modulation in nk cell-meditated cytotoxicity and alteration in the production of important immune cytokines prrsv-induced immunological changes observed simultaneously at both cellular and cytokine levels early postinfection appear to be responsible for the delay in generation of adaptive immunity as the study was performed in pigs maintained under commercial environmental conditions this study has practical implications in design of protective vaccines
the domestic ferret mustela putorius furo has proven to be a useful species for modeling human genetic and infectious diseases of the lung and brain however biomedical research in ferrets has been hindered by the lack of rapid and cost-effective methods for genome engineering here we utilized crispr/cas9-mediated homology-independent insertion at the rosa26 "safe harbor" locus in ferret zygotes and created transgenic animals expressing a dual-fluorescent cre-reporter system flanked by phic31 and bxb1 integrase attp sites out of 151 zygotes injected with circular transgene-containing plasmid and cas9 protein loaded with the rosa26 intron-1 sgrna there were 23 births of which 5 had targeted integration events 22% efficiency the encoded tdtomato transgene was highly expressed in all tissues evaluated targeted integration was verified by pcr analyses southern blot and germline transmission function of the rosa26-cag-loxp tdtomato stoploxp egfp rosa-tg cre-reporter was confirmed in primary cells following cre expression the phi31 and bxb1 integrase attp sites flanking the transgene will also enable rapid directional insertion of any transgene without a size limitation at the rosa26 locus these methods and the model generated will greatly enhance biomedical research involving lineage tracing the evaluation of stem cell therapy and transgenesis in ferret models of human disease animal models of human diseases are indispensable for dissecting disease pathophysiology and developing therapies while mice have been extremely helpful in modeling human diseases in some cases they are inadequate due to species-specific differences in the cell biology of the affected organ and/or the evolutionary divergence of their genome the domestic ferret mustela putorius furo has proven an excellent species for modeling certain human diseases when mice have failed and technologies for genetic engineering in ferrets have expanded the potential use of this species for human disease research however until now techniques for generating transgenic and knockout ferrets have predominantly relied upon genetic manipulation of fibroblasts followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer 12 . such an approach is labor intensive and expensive more recently both clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr/cas9-and transcription activator-like effector nuclease talen-mediated approaches have been used to generate knockout ferrets 34 . here we present a rapid method for generating transgenic ferrets using crispr/cas9-mediated targeted insertion at the rosa26 locus in ferret zygotes the domestic ferret is traditionally known for its ability to model pandemic and seasonal influenza virus infection and transmission to the lung 5 . additionally ferrets develop multi-organ lethal disease following ebolavirus infection 6 and can replicate and transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 7 . the similar cellular distribution of viral receptors in the lung between humans and ferrets likely accounts for the ability of the ferret to serve as a good model of influenza infection 8 9 . further the conserved stem cell biology in the lung between these two species also likely contributes to the ability of ferrets to model bronchiolitis obliterans in an allograft lung published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/
recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new emerging viruses these processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host generating abundant genotypic variants some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits in some plants successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes using a resequencing microarray we examined a persistent infection by a citrus tristeza virus ctv complex in citrus a vegetatively propagated globally important fruit crop and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major ctv genotypes and in addition revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence further increasing the genotypic complexity these data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses
human infections by the newly reassorted avian influenza a h7n9 virus were reported for the first time in early 2013 and the virus was confirmed to be a low pathogenic avian influenza virus in poultry because continuously reported cases have been increasing since the summer of 2013 this novel virus poses a potential threat to public health in china and is attracting broad attention worldwide in this review we summarize and discuss the characteristics of the h7n9 virus revealed by the recent timely studies from the perspectives of epidemiology host preference clinical manifestations immunopathogenesis drug resistance vaccine development and burden of disease this knowledge about the novel avianorigin h7n9 virus will provide a useful reference for clinical interventions of human infections and help to rapidly pave the way to develop an efficient and safe vaccine
toxoplasma gondii is a widespread zoonotic parasite that is relevant for veterinary and public health the domestic cat the definitive host species with the largest worldwide population has become evolutionarily and epidemiologically the most important host of t gondii the outcome of t gondii infection is influenced by congenital and acquired host characteristics we detected differences in t gondii seroprevalence by cat breed in our previous studies the aims of this study were to estimate t gondii seroprevalence in selected domestic cat breeds and to evaluate whether being of a certain breed is associated with t gondii seropositivity when the age and lifestyle of the cat are taken into account the studied breeds were the birman british shorthair burmese korat norwegian forest cat ocicat persian and siamese plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin g antibodies against t gondii with a commercial direct agglutination test at dilution 140 the samples were accompanied by owner-completed questionnaires that provided background data on the cats overall 41.12% of the 1121 cats tested seropositive and the seroprevalence increased with age the burmese had the lowest seroprevalence 18.82% and the persian had the highest 60.00%. according to the final multivariable logistic regression model the odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in birmans ocicats norwegian forest cats and persians when compared with the burmese while older age and receiving raw meat were also risk factors for t gondii seropositivity this study showed that t gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed and identified being of certain breeds older age and receiving raw meat as risk factors for seropositivity
cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis are quickly becoming a useful model for infectious disease and transplantation research even though cynomolgus macaques from different geographic regions are used for these studies there has been limited characterization of full-length major histocompatibility complex mhc class i immunogenetics of distinct geographic populations here we identified 48 mhc class i cdna nucleotide sequences in eleven indonesian cynomolgus macaques including 41 novel mafa-a and mafa-b sequences we found seven mhc class i sequences in indonesian macaques that were identical to mhc class i sequences identified in malaysian or mauritian macaques sharing of nucleotide sequences between these geographically distinct populations is also consistent with the hypothesis that indonesia was a source of the mauritian macaque population in addition we found that the indonesian cdna sequence mafa-b*7601 is identical throughout its peptide binding domain to mamu-b*03 an allele that has been associated with control of simian immunodeficiency virus siv viremia in indian rhesus macaques overall a better understanding of the mhc class i alleles present in indonesian cynomolgus macaques improves their value as a model for disease research and it better defines the biogeography of cynomolgus macaques throughout southeast asia
in this study we compare the development of infection and/or disease in beagle dogs intradermally infected with leishmania chagasi in the presence or absence of lutzomyia longipalpis saliva with those of intravenously infected animals spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for leishmania dna positive spleen cultures for leishmania were detected earlier p ≤ 0.018 and were more frequent five out of the five animals in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals in presence two out of the six animals or absence three out of the five animals of salivary gland lysate of l longipalpis significant increase in serum antibodies against leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group p = 0.004 in addition dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite dna were nevertheless negative for anti-leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit pearson r = −0.8076 p = 0.0026 and hemoglobin pearson r = −0.8403 p = 0.0012 during the infection period no significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals m paranhos-silva et al / veterinary parasitology 114 2003 97-111 inoculation of dogs with leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection it also fails to show an advantage in using l longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis
leishmune ® is the industrialized version of the fml-saponin vaccine which has been shown to develop 92-95% protection in vaccinated dogs and 76-80% vaccine efficacy against field canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl in brazil leishmune ® has been proven to be safe and tolerable and a transmission-blocking vaccine which renders vaccinated dogs non-infectious to sand fly vectors in the present investigation 550 healthy seronegative dogs of endemic and epidemic areas of brazil were monitored for leishmune ®induced immunogenicity during a 2-year trial another group of 588 untreated exposed dogs was also studied in parallel both groups were seronegative on day 0 the strong immunogenicity induced by leishmune ® vaccine was demonstrated by the 98% of fml-seroconversion increase in absorbencies the 82.7% dth positive reactions and increase in skin test size diameters the average increase in cd8+ total lymphocytes population in blood 27.1% expected for qs21 saponin-containing vaccine the sustained proportions of cd4+ t cells and the average increased proportions of cd21+ b lymphocytes 42.3%. the leishmune ® -induced protection against cvl is demonstrated by the results 98.8% asymptomatic dogs at the end of first year and 99% healthy survivors at the end of the second year among vaccinated dogs compared to the 79.4% asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs p < 0.001 monitored in the untreated exposed cohort in spite of the low vaccine coverage it was possible to detect a 66.1% p < 0.005 reduction in belo horizonte and an 80.2% p < 0.005 reduction in araç atuba of the incidence of cvl among vaccinated dogs when compared to the global incidence of cvl of each town respectively our preliminary results support the potential use of leishmune ® to prevent cvl epidemics
this study tested whether gd-bopta/dimeg or gd-dtpa exerts greater relaxation enhancement for blood and reperfused infarcted myocardium relaxivity of gd-bopta is increased by weak binding to serum albumin thirty-six rats were subjected to reperfused infarction before contrast doses = 0.05 0.1 and 0.2 mmollkg ar1 was repeatedly measured over 30 min gd-bopta caused greater ar1 for blood and myocardium than did gd-dtpa clearance of both agents from normal and infarcted myocardium was similar to blood clearance plots of arlmyocardium/arl blood showed equilibrium phase contrast distribution fractional contrast agent distribution volumes were approximately 0.24 for both agents in normal myocardium 0.98 and 1.6 for gd-dtpa and gd-bopta respectively in reperfused infarction the high value for gd-boptpa was ascribed to greater relaxivity in infarction versus blood it was concluded that gd-boptndimeg causes a greater ar1 than gd-dtpa in regions which contain serum albumin
there is an ongoing need for new adjuvants to facilitate development of vaccines against hiv tuberculosis malaria and cancer amongst many others unfortunately the most potent adjuvants are often associated with toxicity and safety issues inulin a plant-derived polysaccharide has no immunological activity in its native soluble form but when crystallised into stable microparticles delta inulin acquires potent adjuvant activity delta inulin has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses against a broad range of co-administered viral bacterial parasitic and toxin antigens inulin normally crystallises as large heterogeneous particles with a broad size distribution and variable solubility temperatures to ensure reproducible delta inulin particles with a consistent size distribution and temperature of solubility a current good manufacturing practice cgmp process was designed to produce advax™ adjuvant in its cgmp form advax™ adjuvant has proved successful in human trials of vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza hepatitis b and insect sting anaphylaxis enhancing antibody and t-cell responses while at the same time being safe and well tolerated advax™ adjuvant thereby represents a novel human adjuvant with positive effects on both humoral and cellular immunity this review describes the discovery and development of advax™ adjuvant and research into its unique mechanism of action
kobuviruses have been identified in the enteric tract of several mammalian species but their role as enteric pathogens is still not defined in this study feline kobuviruses were found in 13.5% of cats with diarrhoea but not in asymptomatic animals in the full-length genome one such strains te/52/13/ita displayed the highest nucleotide identity 96.0% to the prototype strain fk-13 these results provide firm evidence that kobuviruses are common constituents of feline enteric viroma and that they are not geographically restricted to the asian continent where they were first signalled

noroviruses novs are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide nov gii-4 vp1 protein was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system using sf9 insect cells several methods for purification and concentration of virus-like particles vlps were evaluated electron microscopy em and histo-blood group antigen hbga binding assays showed that repeated sucrose gradient purification followed by ultrafiltration resulted in intact vlps with excellent binding to h type 3 antigens vlps were stable for at least 12 months at 4°c and up to 7 days at ambient temperature these findings indicate that this method yielded stable and high-quality vlps
a new human-pathogenic parvovirus human bocavirus hbov has recently been discovered and associated with respiratory disease in small children however many patients have presented with low viral dna loads suggesting hbov persistence and rendering polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis problematic moreover nothing is known of hbov immunity we examined hbov-specific systemic b cell responses and assessed their diagnostic use in young children with respiratory disease patients and methods paired serum samples from 117 children with acute wheezing previously studied for 16 respiratory viruses were tested by immunoblot assays using 2 recombinant hbov capsid antigens the unique part of virus protein 1 and virus protein 2 results virus protein 2 was superior to the unique part of virus protein 1 with respect to immunoreactivity according to the virus protein 2 assay 24 49% of 49 children who were positive for hbov according to polymerase chain reaction had immunoglobulin ig m antibodies 36 73% had igg antibodies and 29 59% exhibited igm antibodies and/or an increase in igg antibody level of 22 patients with an increase in antibody levels 20 91% had a high load of hbov dna in the nasopharynx supporting the hypothesis that a high hbov dna load indicates acute primary infection whereas a low load seems to be of less clinical significance in a subgroup of patients who were previously determined to have acute hbov infection defined as a high virus load in the nasopharynx viremia and absence of other viral infections 9 100% of 9 patients had serological evidence of primary infection in the control group of 68 children with wheezing who had polymerase chain reaction results negative for hbov in the nasopharynx 9 13% had igm antibodies including 5 who displayed an increase in igg antibody levels and were viremic no cross-reactivity with human parvovirus b19 was detected conclusions respiratory infections due to hbov are systemic elicit b cell immune responses and can be diagnosed serologically serological diagnoses correlate with high virus loads in the nasopharynx and with viremia serological testing is an accurate tool for disclosing the association of hbov infection with disease viral infections of the lower airways are a major cause of morbidity and even mortality in infants and small children the classical perpetrators are rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus influenza virus parainfluenza virus and adenovirus but interesting newcomers such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus human metapneumovirus and more recently human bocavirus hbov also cause severe disease hbov was
waterfowl are primary hosts for influenza a viruses iavs however there is sporadic infection of swine and other species that pose a risk of zoonotic spread yellow-shouldered bats were shown to be hosts of an iav thereby constituting a potential novel reservoir we show that pteropus alecto kidney cells paki are susceptible to infection and sustain replication of a/wsn/33 h1n1 and a/vietnam/1203/04 h5n1 importantly we show that co-infection of paki cells results in novel reassortants please cite this paper as dlugolenski et al 2013 bat cells from pteropus alecto are susceptible to influenza a virus infection and reassortment influenza and other respiratory viruses 76 900-903
infectious bronchitis ib and newcastle disease nd are common viral diseases of chickens which are caused by infectious bronchitis virus ibv and newcastle disease virus ndv respectively vaccination with live attenuated strains of ibv-h120 and ndv-lasota are important for the control of ib and nd however conventional live attenuated vaccines are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated chickens therefore there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious vaccines in this study using a previously established reverse genetics system we generated a recombinant ibv virus based on the ibv h120 vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn protein of ndv the recombinant virus r-h120-hn/5a exhibited growth dynamics pathogenicity and viral titers that were similar to those of the parental ibv h120 but it had acquired hemagglutination activity from ndv vaccination of spf chickens with the r-h120-hn/5a virus induced a humoral response at a level comparable to that of the lasota/h120 commercial bivalent vaccine and provided significant protection against challenge with virulent ibv and ndv in summary the results of this study indicate that the ibv h120 strain could serve as an effective tool for designing vaccines against ib and other infectious diseases and the generation of ibv r-h120-hn/5a provides a solid foundation for the development of an effective bivalent vaccine against ibv and ndv
significance and impact of the study as a widespread swine pathogen pedv affects the swine industry enormously it causes enteritis in swine of all ages and is often fatal in neonatal piglets our data show that pregnant sows were immunized with 'coated pedv-loaded microspheres + killed pedv vaccines' heterologous prime-boost immunization could protect more than 90% suckling piglets delivered by the sows against the virus these findings provide a new model of developing safe and effective immunizations for newborn animals against established and emerging enteric infections porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv causes severe diarrhoea in neonatal suckling piglets with a high mortality maternal vaccines that can induce lactogenic immunity to protect suckling piglets via colostrums and milk are pivotal for the prevention and control of pedv infection in neonatal suckling piglets in this study a group of pregnant sows were first orally immunized with coated pedv-loaded microspheres and boosted with killed pedv vaccines heterologous prime-boost it has been detected that the levels of pedv-specific antibodies igg and iga in their sera and milks were higher than other negative groups p < 0á001 or p < 0á05 furthermore it has been proved by the neutralization assay that the induced antibodies could significantly inhibit virus infection as compared to other negative groups p < 0á01 or p < 0á05 importantly after pedv challenge more than 90% of the suckling piglets delivered by the sows in the heterologous prime-boost group were completely protected overall the results show that 'heterologous prime-boost' form is an efficient and effective way to provide protection for suckling piglets against pedv through lactogenic immunity
enteric bacteria with a demonstrable or potential ability to form attaching-effacing lesions so-called attaching-effacing ae bacteria have been found in the intestinal tracts of a wide variety of warm-blooded animal species including man in some host species for example cattle pigs rabbits and human beings attaching-effacing escherichia coli aeec have an established role as enteropathogens in other host species ae bacteria are of less certain significance with continuing advances in the detection and typing of ae strains the importance of these bacteria for many hosts is likely to become clearer the pathogenic effects of ae bacteria result from adhesion to the intestinal mucosa by a variety of mechanisms culminating in the formation of the characteristic intimate adhesion of the ae lesion the ability to induce ae lesions is mediated by the co-ordinated expression of some 40 bacterial genes organized within a so-called pathogenicity island known as the "locus for enterocyte effacement". it is also believed that the production of bacterial toxins principally vero toxins is a significant virulence factor for some aeec strains recent areas of research into ae bacteria include the use of citrobacter rodentium to model human aeec disease quorum-sensing mechanisms used by aeec to modulate virulence gene expression and the potential role of adhesion in the persistent colonization of the intestine by ae bacteria this review of ae bacteria covers their molecular biology their occurrence in various animal species and the diagnosis pathology and clinical aspects of animal diseases with which they are associated reference is made to human pathogens where appropriate the focus is mainly on natural colonization and disease but complementary experimental data are also included q

the hamadryas baboon papio hamadryas hamadryas is the only indigenous species of nonhuman primates nhp found in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa there are no peerreviewed publications on viral infections of the baboons of ksa apart from camels other animals are likely sources of the novel middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov for humans we investigated evidence of highly pathogenic coronavirus infections including merscov in a large group of commensal baboons accompanied by feral dogs on the outskirts of ta'if city ksa in february 2013 fifty baboons 16 juveniles and 34 adults were screened for serum antibodies to human coronaviruses hcov-043/-nl63/-229 and canine coronaviruses ccov-1-3 using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa technique and for merscov antibodies using serum neutralization test snt of the 50 sampled baboons 22% n = 11 were seropositive to hcovs 10% n = 5 were seropositive to ccovs while none had detectable merscov antibodies these findings bear potentially significant implications for public health canine health and baboon conservation efforts necessitating follow-up investigations and preventive measures at locations where baboons frequent human habitations or are regarded as tourist attractions in ksa
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly emergent human disease which requires rapid diagnosis and effective therapy among antibody sources immunoglobulin y igy is the major antibody found in chicken eggs and can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies normally used in research and immunotherapy in this study phage-expressing chicken monoclonal scfv antibody was chosen and characterized with phage display antibody technology truncated fragments of sars-cov spike protein were cloned in pet-21 vector and expressed in bl-21 escherichia coli e coli cells after purification the purity of these recombinant spike proteins was examined on sds-page and their identity verified with western blot analysis using anti-his antibodies and sera from convalescent stage sars-cov-infected patients using these bacteria-derived proteins to immunize chickens it was found that polyclonal igy antibodies in the egg yolk and sera were highly reactive to the immunogens as shown by western blot and immunocytochemical staining analysis a phage displaying scfv library was also established from spleen b cells of immunized chicken with 5 â 10 7 clones after four panning cycles the eluted phage titer showed a 10-fold increase in sequence analysis with chicken germline gene five phage clones reacted with large dissimilarities of between 31 and 62% in the complementarity-determining regions one dominant phage 4s1 had strong binding to fragment se-e located between amino acid residues 456-650 of the spike protein and this particular phage had significantly strong binding to sars-cov-infected vero e6 cells based on the results we conclude that generating specific scfv-expressing phage binders with the phage display system can be successfully achieved and that this knowledge can be applied in clinical or academic research #
a case-control study was designed to investigate the role of different cryptosporidium spp in swedish dairy herds with and without calf diarrhoeal problems faecal samples were collected from preweaned calves young stock and cows cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by sodium chloride flotation and epifluorescence microscopy molecular diagnostics were used to identify cryptosporidium species samples containing c parvum were further analysed to determine subtypes calf faecal samples were also analysed for rotavirus coronavirus and escherichia coli f5+. total protein was assessed in 1-to 8-day-old calves a questionnaire was used to identify differences in management routines cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in all herds with equal prevalence in case and control herds in all three age groups cryptosporidium parvum cryptosporidium bovis cryptosporidium ryanae and cryptosporidium andersoni were all identified as were rotavirus coronavirus and e coli f5+. c ryanae and c andersoni were only detected in non-diarrhoeal samples whereas the other pathogens were detected in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal samples diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves disinfection of single pens was more common in case herds and several other management routines seemed to differ although results were not significant
we tested the efficacy of coronavirus-like particles vlps for protecting mice against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus scov infection coexpression of scov s protein and e m and n proteins of mouse hepatitis virus in 293t or cho cells resulted in the efficient production of chimeric vlps carrying scov s protein balb/c mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric vlps and alum twice at an interval of four weeks were protected from scov challenge as indicated by the absence of infectious virus in the lungs the same groups of mice had high levels of scovspecific neutralizing antibodies while mice in the negative control groups which were not immunized with chimeric vlps failed to manifest neutralizing antibodies suggesting that scovspecific neutralizing antibodies are important for the suppression of viral replication within the lungs despite some differences in the cellular composition of inflammatory infiltrates we did not observe any overt lung pathology in the chimeric-vlp-treated mice when compared to the negative control mice our results show that chimeric vlp can be an effective vaccine strategy against scov infection
background the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov causes severe respiratory infection with a high ~35% mortality rate neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike of mers-cov have been shown to be a therapeutic option for treatment of lethal disease methods we describe the germline diversity and neutralizing activity of 13 potent human monoclonal antibodies mabs that target the mers-cov spike s protein biological functions were assessed by live mers-cov pseudotype particle and its variants and structural basis was also determined by crystallographic analysis results of the 13 mabs displaying strong neutralizing activity against mers-cov two with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region ighv1-69-derived heavy chain named mers-gd27 and mers-gd33 showed the most potent neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and live mers-cov in vitro mutagenesis analysis suggested that mers-gd27 and mers-gd33 recognized distinct regions in s glycoproteins and the combination of 2 mabs demonstrated a synergistic effect in neutralization against pseudotyped mers-cov the structural basis of mers-gd27 neutralization and recognition revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site conclusions our data provide new insights into the specific antibody repertoires and the molecular determinants of neutralization during natural mers-cov infection in humans this finding supports additional efforts to design and develop novel therapies to combat mers-cov infections in humans

vaccination with a live bivalent vaccine of newcastle disease virus ndv and infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a routine practice in poultry industry in china this study was designed to evaluate ginseng stem-leaf saponins gsls in combination with selenium se for their adjuvant effect on the immune response to vaccination against ndv and ibv in chickens a live bivalent vaccine of ndv and ibv was diluted in saline solution containing gsls or se or both and used to immunize chickens via a intraocular-andintranasal route results showed that gsls promoted significantly higher ndv-and ibv-specific antibody responses with the highest antibody response detected in gsls-se group the increased antibody was capable of neutralizing ndv and ibv in addition gsls-se enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and production of ifn-γ and il-4 more importantly gsls-se was found to promote early production and prolong the duration of the antibody responses in order to improve the efficacy of vaccination in chicken flocks the diluent containing gsls-se deserves further studies to evaluate its effect on other chicken vaccines
disease risk mapping is important for predicting and mitigating impacts of bat-borne viruses including hendra virus paramyxoviridaehenipavirus that can spillover to domestic animals and thence to humans we produced two models to estimate areas at potential risk of hev spillover explained by the climatic suitability for its flying fox reservoir hosts pteropus alecto and p conspicillatus we included additional climatic variables that might affect spillover risk through other biological processes such as bat or horse behaviour plant phenology and bat foraging habitat models were fit with a poisson point process model and a log-gaussian cox process in response to climate change risk expanded southwards due to an expansion of p alecto suitable habitat which increased the number of horses at risk by 175-260% 110000-165000 in the northern limits of the current distribution spillover risk was highly uncertain because of model extrapolation to novel climatic conditions the extent of areas at risk of spillover from p conspicillatus was predicted shrink due to a likely expansion of p alecto into these areas it could replace p conspicillatus as the main hev reservoir we recommend 1 hev monitoring in bats 2 enhancing hev prevention in horses in areas predicted to be at risk 3 investigate and develop mitigation strategies for areas that could experience reservoir host replacements
the clinical course of tick-borne encephalitis tbe a disease caused by tbe virus ranges from asymptomatic or mild influenza-like infection to severe debilitating encephalitis or encephalomyelitis despite the medical importance of this disease some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood in particular the basis of the disease severity is largely unknown methods tbe virus growth neutralizing antibody response key cytokine and chemokine mrna production and changes in mrna levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells in brain were measured in mice with different susceptibilities to tbe virus infection showing different severities of the infection in relation to the host genetic background was developed after subcutaneous inoculation of tbe virus balb/c mice showed medium susceptibility to the infection sts mice were resistant and ccs-11 mice were highly susceptible the resistant sts mice showed lower and delayed viremia lower virus production in the brain and low cytokine/chemokine mrna production but had a strong neutralizing antibody response the most sensitive strain ccs-11 failed in production of neutralizing antibodies but exhibited strong cytokine/chemokine mrna production in the brain after intracerebral inoculation all mouse strains were sensitive to the infection and had similar virus production in the brain but sts mice survived significantly longer than ccs-11 mice these two strains also differed in the expression of key cytokines/chemokines particularly interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10/cxcl10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1/ccl2 in the brain our data indicate that the genetic control is an important factor influencing the clinical course of tbe high neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality but high expression of various cytokines/chemokines during tbe can mediate immunopathology and be associated with more severe course of the infection and increased fatality
background the world health organisation who recommended the development of simple safe sensitive and specific neutralization assays for avian influenza antibodies we have used retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza h5 hemagglutinin ha as safe surrogate viruses for influenza neutralization assays which can be carried out at biosafety level 2 results using our assay sera from patients who had recovered from infection with influenza h5n1 and sera from animals experimentally immunized or infected with h5 tested positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to h5n1 pseudotype neutralizing antibody titers were compared with titers obtained by hemagglutinin inhibition hi assays and microneutralization mn assays using live virus and showed a high degree of correlation sensitivity and specificity the pseudotype neutralization assay is as sensitive as horse erythrocyte hi and mn for the detection of antibodies to h5n1 it is safer and can be applied in a high-throughput format for human and animal surveillance and for the evaluation of vaccines
the dog is considered the main domestic reservoir for trypanosoma cruzi infection and a suitable experimental animal model to study the pathological changes during the course of chagas disease cd vaccine development is one of cd prevention methods to protect people at risk two plasmids containing genes encoding a trans-sialidase protein tcsp and an amastigote-specific glycoprotein tcssp4 were used as dna vaccines in a canine model splenomegaly was not found in either of the recombinant plasmid-immunized groups however cardiomegaly was absent in animals immunized only with the plasmid containing the tcssp4 gene the inflammation of subendocardial and myocardial tissues was prevented only with the immunization with tcssp4 gene in conclusion the vaccination with these genes has a partial protective effect on the enlargement of splenic and cardiac tissues during the chronic cd and on microscopic hearth damage since both plasmids prevented splenomegaly but only one avoided cardiomegaly and the lesions in heart tissue of dog immunized with plasmid containing the tcssp4 gene covered only subepicardial tissue
hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine hev was adapted to growth in suckling mouse brain electron micrographs of hev-infected suckling mouse brain prepared by negative staining and thin-section techniques exhibited typical morphological characteristics shared with other members of the coronaviridae the adaptation of hev to suckling mouse brain facilitated serologic testing by the use of common host reagents and compatible animal systems with hemagglutination inhibition complement-fixation and neutralization tests an antigenic relationship was demonstrated between human coronavirus oc 43 and hev in specific immune and hyperimmune animal sera children and adults with seroconversion to oc 43 antigen had diagnostic rises in titer of antibody to hev antigens individuals with seroconversion to human coronaviruses 229e and b814 demonstrated antibody to hev but not diagnostic rises in titer swine with titers of antibody to hev had lower or no detectable titers of antibody to coronavirus oc 43 although the prevalence and geometric mean titer of antibody to dc 43 were higher than the titer of antibody to hev in every group of normal humans tested significant differences in antibody response to coronavirus dc 43 and hev were seen between populations that did or did not have possible contact with swine the evidence suggested that antibody to hev in humans probably represented a heterologous response to infection with coronavirus dc 43 however a heterotypic response to unknown or uncharacterized strains of coronavirus cannot be excluded in 1967 mcl ntosh et £11 reported the isolation of six strains of virus similar to infectious bronchitis virus in organ culture oc from adults with upper respiratory illness two strains of this virus designated oc 38 and oc 43 were subsequently adapted to growth in the suckling mouse brain smb reagents prepared from these strains were serologically identical by cf and neutralization tests . these strains were classified as coronaviruses on the basis of their distinctive morphology and according to other fundamental characteristics that they shared with avian infectious bronchitis virus mouse hepatitis virus .mhv and human coronavirus strains
age-related macular degeneration amd is a major cause of blindness in the developed world oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in amd but precise mechanisms remain poorly defined carboxyethylpyrrole cep is an amd-associated lipid peroxidation product we previously demonstrated that mice immunized with cep-modified albumin developed amd-like degenerative changes in the outer retina here we examined the kinetics of lesion development in immunized mice and the presence of macrophages within the interphotoreceptor matrix ipm between the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor outer segments we observed a significant and time-dependent increase in the number of macrophages in immunized mice relative to young age-matched controls prior to overt pathology these changes were more pronounced in balb/c mice than in c57bl/6 mice importantly ipm-infiltrating macrophages were polarized toward the m1 phenotype but only in immunized mice moreover when ccr2-deficient mice were immunized macrophages were not present in the ipm and no retinal lesions were observed suggesting a deleterious role for these cells in our model this work provides mechanistic evidence linking immune responses against oxidative damage with the presence of proinflammatory macrophages at sites of future amd and experimentally demonstrates that manipulating immunity may be a target for modulating the development of amd
diverse coronaviruses have been identifi ed in bats from several continents but not from africa we identifi ed group 1 and 2 coronaviruses in bats in kenya including sars-related coronaviruses the sequence diversity suggests that bats are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of coronaviruses for many species including humans

background emerging bacterial zoonoses in bats and rodents remain relatively understudied we conduct the first comparative host-pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts using bartonella spp and leptospira spp as a model methodology/principal findings we used published genetic data for 51 bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species 129 bartonella from 38 rodents and 26 leptospira from 20 bats we generated maximum likelihood and bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs parafit paco and jane bartonella spp and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit parafitglobal = 1.9703 p#0.001 m 2 global value = 7.3320 p#0.0001 bartonella spp and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation parafitglobal = 102.4409 p#0.001 m 2 global value = 86.532 p#0.0001 in contrast we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in leptospira and bats parafitglobal = 0.0042 p = 0.84 m 2 global value = 4.6310 p = 0.5629 separate analyses of new world and old world data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets we also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite 0.731 while bartonella and rodents had the fewest 0.264 conclusions/significance in both bat and rodent hosts bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching while leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans
serological assays for anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis guide epidemiological intervention and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration we developed and validated new anti-sars-cov-2 igg igm and iga elisa tests enzy-well sars-cov-2 elisa diesse diagnostica senese s p a based on whole-virus antigens we used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from covid-19 suspected and confirmed cases healthy donors and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions overall the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity especially for igg and iga we observed high sensitivity 92.5 and 93.6% respectively specificity was high >96% for all antibody types elisas in addition sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset dso due to the seroconversion window and for enzy-well sars-cov-2 igg and iga . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review medrxiv preprint 2 elisas resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 dso respectively the results showed that enzy-well sars-cov-2 elisas may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes covering all different antibody types developed in sars-cov-2 immune response
conventional influenza vaccines need to be designed and manufactured yearly however they occasionally provide poor protection owing to antigenic mismatch hence there is an urgent need to develop universal vaccines against influenza virus using nucleoprotein np and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 m2e genes from the influenza a virus a/beijing/30/95 h3n2 we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying np fused with one or four copies of m2e genes in different orders the recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize balb/c mice humoral and cellular responses were measured and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza a virus a/puerto rico/8/34 pr8 np-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length np while robust m2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of m2e all recombinant viruses elicited np-and m2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice only immunization with rvj-4m2enp induced remarkably higher levels of il-2 and il-10 cytokines specific to m2e furthermore rvj-4m2enp immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 mld 50 of pr8 therefore the cross-protection potentially correlates with both np and m2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by rvj-4m2enp which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length np preceded by four m2e repeats these results suggest that the rational fusion of np and multiple m2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses and the 4m2enp fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine
the ability of emerging pathogens to infect new species is likely related to the diversity of pathogen variants present in existing reservoirs and their degree of genomic plasticity which determines their ability to adapt to new environments certain simian immunodeficiency viruses sivcpz sivsm have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species including humans resulting in the hiv-1 and hiv-2 epidemics although siv diversification has been studied on a population level the essential substrates for cross-species transmission namely siv sequence diversity and the types and extent of viral diversification present in individual reservoir animals have not been elucidated to characterize this intra-host siv diversity we performed sequence analyses of clonal viral envelope env v1v2 and gag p27 variants present in individual sivsm-infected sooty mangabeys over time results sivsm demonstrated extensive intra-animal v1v2 length variation and amino acid diversity le38% and continual variation in v1v2 n-linked glycosylation consensus sequence frequency and location positive selection was the predominant evolutionary force temporal sequence shifts suggested continual selection likely due to evolving antibody responses in contrast gag p27 was predominantly under purifying selection sivsm v1v2 sequence diversification is at least as great as that in hiv-1 infected humans indicating that extensive viral diversification in and of itself does not inevitably lead to aids positive diversifying selection in this natural reservoir host is the engine that has driven the evolution of the uniquely adaptable siv/hiv envelope protein these studies emphasize the importance of retroviral diversification within individual host reservoir animals as a critical substrate in facilitating cross-species transmission
outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped were reported across europe during the 1980s and 1990s but only sporadic outbreaks occurred in recent years ped virus pedv spread for the first time into the usa in 2013 and has caused severe economic losses retrospectively it was found that two different strains of pedv have been introduced into the united states both are closely related to strains circulating in china where a new wave of the disease occurred from 2010 onwards since autumn 2014 new outbreaks of ped have occurred in europe in this study weaned piglets were inoculated with an early european isolate br1/87 or faecal/intestinal suspensions derived from pigs infected with a recent european strain of pedv from germany or a us strain of pedv no evidence for infection resulted from inoculation of pigs with the german sample that contained high levels of pedv rna there were no clinical signs excretion of viral rna or anti-pedv antibody production in contrast all the pigs in the other two groups showed evidence of infection mild clinical signs of disease mainly diarrhoea occurred in piglets inoculated with the br1/87 and us pedv strains pedv rna was detected throughout the intestine in euthanized animals at 4 days postinoculation in addition within these animals low levels of viral rna were detected in lungs and livers with higher levels in spleens seroconversion against pedv occurred in all surviving infected animals within 10 days pedv rna excretion occurred for at least 2 weeks the us pedv rna was detected at low levels in serum samples on multiple days it is apparent that current diagnostic systems can detect infection by the different virus strains
influenza virus infection is a prevalent disease in humans antibodies against hemagglutinin have been shown to prevent infection and hence hemagglutinin is the major constituent of current vaccines antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of m2 have also been shown to mediate protection against influenza a infection in various animal models active vaccination is generally considered the best approach to combat viral diseases however passive immunization is an attractive alternative particularly in acutely exposed or immune compromized individuals young children and the elderly we recently described a novel method for the rapid isolation of natural human antibodies by mammalian cell display here we used this approach to isolate human monoclonal antibodies directed against the highly conserved extracellular domain of the influenza a m2 protein the identified antibodies bound m2 peptide with high affinities recognized native cell-surface expressed m2 and protected mice from a lethal influenza virus challenge moreover therapeutic treatment up to 2 days after infection was effective suggesting that m2-specific monoclonals have a great potential as immunotherapeutic agents against influenza infection
pandemics caused by influenza a virus iav are responsible for the deaths of millions of humans around the world one of these pandemics occurred in mexico in 2009 despite the impact of iav on human health there is no effective vaccine gene mutations and translocation of genome segments of different iav subtypes infecting a single host cell make the development of a universal vaccine difficult the design of immunogenic peptides using bioinformatics tools could be an interesting strategy to increase the success of vaccines in this work we used the predicted amino acid sequences of the neuraminidase na and hemagglutinin ha proteins of different iav subtypes to perform multiple alignments epitope predictions molecular dynamics simulations and experimental validation peptide selection was based on the following criteria promiscuity protein surface exposure and the degree of conservation among different medically relevant iav strains these peptides were tested using immunological assays to test their ability to induce production of antibodies against iav we immunized rabbits and mice and measured the levels of igg and iga antibodies in serum samples and nasal washes rabbit antibodies against the peptides p11 and p14 both of which are hybrids of na and ha recognized ha from both group 1 h1 h2 and h5 and group 2 h3 and h7 iav and also recognized the purified na protein from the viral stock influenza a puerto rico/916/34 igg antibodies from rabbits immunized with p11 and p14 were capable of recognizing viral particles and inhibited virus hemagglutination additionally intranasal immunization of mice with p11 and p14 induced specific igg and iga antibodies in serum and nasal mucosa respectively interestingly the igg antibodies were found to have neutralizing capability in conclusion the peptides designed through in silico studies were validated in experimental assays

the outcome of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the immunological response to the bacillus calmette-guerin bcg vaccine are highly variable in humans deciphering the relative importance of host genetics environment and vaccine preparation for the efficacy of bcg has proven difficult in natural populations we developed a model system that captures the breadth of immunological responses observed in outbred individual mice which can be used to understand the contribution of host genetics to vaccine efficacy this system employs a panel of highly diverse inbred mouse strains consisting of the founders and recombinant progeny of the "collaborative cross" project unlike natural populations the structure of this panel allows the serial evaluation of genetically identical individuals and the quantification of genotype-specific effects of interventions such as vaccination when analyzed in the aggregate our panel resembled natural populations in several important respects the animals displayed a broad range of susceptibility to m tuberculosis differed in their immunological responses to infection and were not durably protected by bcg vaccination however when analyzed at the genotype level we found that these phenotypic differences were heritable m tuberculosis susceptibility varied between lines from extreme sensitivity to progressive m tuberculosis clearance similarly only a minority of the genotypes was protected by vaccination the efficacy of bcg was genetically separable from susceptibility to m tuberculosis and the lack of efficacy in the aggregate analysis was driven by nonresponsive lines that mounted a qualitatively distinct response to infection these observations support an important role for host genetic diversity in determining bcg efficacy and provide a new resource to rationally develop more broadly efficacious vaccines importance tuberculosis tb remains an urgent global health crisis and the efficacy of the currently used tb vaccine m bovis bcg is highly variable the design of more broadly efficacious vaccines depends on understanding the factors that limit the protection imparted by bcg while these complex factors are difficult to disentangle in natural populations we used a model population of mice to understand the role of host genetic composition in bcg efficacy we found that the ability of bcg to protect mice with different genotypes was remarkably variable the efficacy of bcg did not depend on the intrinsic susceptibility of the animal but instead correlated with qualitative differences in the immune responses to the pathogen these studies suggest that host genetic polymorphism is a critical determinant of vaccine efficacy and provide a model system to develop interventions that will be useful in genetically diverse populations
emerging diseases are a major challenge to public health revealing the evolutionary processes that allow novel pathogens to adapt to new hosts also the potential barriers to host adaptation is central to understanding the drivers of disease emergence in particular it is unclear how the genetics and ecology of pathogens interact to shape the likelihood of successful cross-species transmission to better understand the determinants of host adaptation and emergence we modelled key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics at both intra-and inter-host scales using parameter values similar to those observed in influenza virus we considered the possibility of acquiring the necessary host adaptive mutations both before 'off-the-shelf' emergence and after 'tailor-made' emergence a virus is transmitted from a donor to a new recipient species under both scenarios population bottlenecks at interhost transmission act as a major barrier to host adaptation greatly limiting the number of adaptive mutations that are able to cross the species barrier in addition virus emergence is hindered if the fitness valley between the donor and recipient hosts is either too steep or too shallow overall our results reveal where in evolutionary parameter space a virus could adapt to and become transmissible in a new species
exotic small mammal medicine is a relatively new specialty area within veterinary medicine ferrets rabbits and rodents have long been used as animal models in human medical research investigations resulting in a body of basic anatomic and physiologic information that can be used by veterinarians treating these species unfortunately there is a paucity of veterinary articles that describe clinical presentation diagnosis and treatment options of gastrointestinal gi disease as it affects exotic small mammals although there is little reference material relating to exotic small mammal gi disease patients are commonly presented to veterinary hospitals with digestive tract disorders this article provides the latest information available for gi disease in ferrets helicobacter mustelae gastritis inflammatory bowel disease gi lymphoma systemic coronavirus coccidiosis and liver disease rabbits gi motility disorders liver lobe torsion astrovirus and coccidiosis guinea pigs gastric dilatation volvulus rats taenia taeniaeformis and hamsters clostridium difficile both noninfectious diseases and emerging infectious diseases are reviewed as well as the most up-to-date diagnostics and treatment options
hand foot and mouth disease hfmd a common contagious disease that usually affects children is normally mild but can have life-threatening manifestations it can be caused by enteroviruses particularly coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 hev71 with highly variable clinical manifestations in the spring of 2008 a large unprecedented hfmd outbreak in fuyang city of anhui province in the central part of southeastern china resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases in this study epidemiologic and clinical investigations laboratory testing and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak of the 6049 cases reported between 1 march and 9 may of 2008 3023 50% were hospitalized 353 5.8% were severe and 22 0.36% were fatal hev71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak phylogenetic analyses of entire vp1 capsid protein sequence of 45 fuyang hev71 isolates showed that they belong to c4a cluster of the c4 subgenotype in addition genetic recombinations were found in the 3d region rna-dependent rna polymerase a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome between the fuyang hev71 strain and coxsackievirus a16 cv-a16 resulting in a recombination virus in conclusion an emerging recombinant hev71 was responsible for the hfmd outbreak in fuyang city of china 2008
in this review i use the term "perpetuation" for persistence of a virus in a population since this is a different phenomenon from persistence of a virus in an infected host important variables that influence perpetuation differ in small <1000 individuals and large >10000 populations in small populations two important variables are persistence in individuals and turnover of the population while in large populations important variables are transmissibility generation time and seasonality in small populations viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections cannot readily be perpetuated in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis b virus that cause persistent infections however small animal populations can turnover significantly each year permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses for instance measles required a population of 500000 for perpetuation in the pre-measles vaccine era furthermore if an acute virus such as poliovirus exhibits marked seasonality in large populations then it may disappear during the seasonal trough even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease as in the instance of smallpox therefore the requirements for perpetuation have significant implications for practical public health goals
recognition of the significance of the boundary between ecological systems often referred to as the ecotone has a long history in the ecological sciences and in zoonotic disease research more recent research in landscape ecology has produced an expanded view of ecotones and elaboration of their characteristics and functions in ecosystems parallel research on emerging infectious diseases eids and the causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission spread and adaptation suggests a correspondence between ecotonal processes and the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for zoonotic and vector-borne emerging infections a review of the literature suggests that ecotones play a role in a number of the most important eids yet these are the only diseases for which specific landscape ecological information exists in the literature or disease reports however the similar disease ecologies of these with about half of the approximately 130 zoonotic eids suggests ecotones particularly their anthropogenic origination or modification may be generally associated with ecotones and the global trend of increasing eids
a panel of 28 monoclonal antibodies mab against the structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus-4 strain jhm mhv-4 was used in three antigen binding assays to determine the extent of antigenic homology among six strains of murine coronaviruses the antigenic determinants studied were highly conserved on the el glycoproteins and nucleocapsid n proteins of all strains tested in contrast antigenic polymorphism was observed among the e2 glycoproteins of three previously described antigenic determinants against which neutralizing antibodies are directed only one termed ae2 was conserved on all strains antigenic site be2 was found only on the strongly neurotropic mhv4 and site ce2 was present on the virulent mhv4 and mhv-3 hepatotropic strains but absent on the weakly pathogenic mhv-a59 mhv-1 and mhv-s strains four non-neutralizing antibodies against at least one topographically distinct antigenic determinant which we previously designated de2 gave binding patterns consistent with two distinct sites one of these was present on all mhv strains tested and the other was present on all strains except mhv-s these non-neutralizing antigenic sites were redesignated ee2 and de2 respectively coronavirus antigen glycoprotein monoclonal antibody epitope polymorphism
understanding the dynamics of movement of bacteria within the environment and between species is crucial to unraveling the epidemiology of bacterial diseases and to developing biosecurity measures to prevent dissemination many arthropods some beneþcial and some detrimental inhabit poultry houses the lesser mealworm alphitobius diaperinus panzer coleoptera tenebrionidae is a pest commonly found in poultry litter that can harbor pathogens involved in both human and animal health issues current farm management practices perpetuate persistent infestations contributing to the dispersal of beetles and pathogens to study the dissemination of bacteria by this beetle we require the ability to differentiate internal from external sources of bacteria carried by the beetle in this study we tested previously described methods to externally disinfect beetles and found disinfectant efþcacies between 40 and 98%. the irregular surface of the insect posed a challenge to cleansing procedures because the surface offered many recesses able to sequester bacteria complete bacterial disinfection was achieved with a serial treatment of ethanol and hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide/peracetic acid
influenza virus infection of humans results in a respiratory disease that ranges in severity from sub-clinical infection to primary viral pneumonia that can result in death the clinical effects of infection vary with the exposure history age and immune status of the host and also the virulence of the influenza strain in humans the virus is transmitted through either aerosol or contact-based transfer of infectious respiratory secretions as is evidenced by most zoonotic influenza virus infections not all strains that can infect humans are able to transmit from person-to-person animal models of influenza are essential to research efforts aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to the disease and transmission outcomes of influenza virus infection in humans these models furthermore allow the pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in the population through amelioration of the virulence or transmissibility of influenza viruses mice ferrets guinea pigs cotton rats hamsters and macaques have all been used to study influenza viruses and therapeutics targeting them each model presents unique advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed herein
the presence of domestic/free-ranging dogs in brazilian protected areas and native vegetation fragments is an important problem mainly because these animals pose a threat to wild species that live in such areas in addition dogs constantly circulate between wildlife environments and urban regions acting as "bridges" in spillover events dogs are traditionally recognized as vectors of zoonoses which are correct but their roles as facilitating agents for the "jump" of pathogens from wild animals to humans and vice versa are sparsely debated in this context this work briefly describes the different roles of dogs in the dynamics and ecology of infectious diseases using the brazilian scenario as a study model
pathogens are embedded in a complex network of microparasites that can collectively or individually alter disease dynamics and outcomes endemic pathogens that infect an individual in the first years of life for example can either facilitate or compete with subsequent pathogens thereby exacerbating or ameliorating morbidity and mortality pathogen associations are ubiquitous but poorly understood particularly in wild populations we report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in african lions leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens we combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales we found significant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identified both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens our results provide novel insights on the complex associations underlying pathogen co-occurrence networks
infectious diseases have caused die-offs in both free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees understanding pathogen diversity and disease ecology is therefore critical for conserving these endangered animals to determine viral diversity in free-ranging non-habituated gorillas and chimpanzees in the republic of congo genetic testing was performed on greatape fecal samples collected near odzala-kokoua national park samples were analyzed to determine ape species identify individuals in the population and to test for the presence of herpesviruses adenoviruses poxviruses bocaviruses flaviviruses paramyxoviruses coronaviruses filoviruses and simian immunodeficiency virus siv we identified 19 dna viruses representing two viral families herpesviridae and adenoviridae of which three herpesviruses had not been previously described co-detections of multiple herpesviruses and/or adenoviruses were present in both gorillas and chimpanzees cytomegalovirus cmv and lymphocryptovirus lcv were found primarily in the context of co-association with each other and adenoviruses using viral discovery curves for herpesviruses and adenoviruses the total viral richness in the sample population of gorillas and chimpanzees was estimated to be a minimum of 23 viruses corresponding to a detection rate of 83%. these findings represent the first description of dna viral diversity in feces from free-ranging gorillas and chimpanzees in or near the odzala-kokoua national park and form a basis for understanding the types of viruses circulating among great apes in this region nucleotide sequences were trimmed and aligned against each other and with available sequences in genbank genbank national center for biotechnology information http//www ncbi nlm nih gov using the geneious alignment tool geneious pro 5.1.7 software biomatters ltd auckland nz and bayesian analysis was performed mrbayes 3.1 plugin in geneious pro using gamma distributed rate variation using a general hky85 substitution model .

a major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in latin america where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs by analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies vbr outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in peru we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of vbr viral expansions are geographically widespread but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the andes mountains within andean valleys invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats which together will fuel high transmission and mortality using spatial models we forecast the pathways of ongoing vbr epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes these results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence reveal vbr as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs
a minor groove binder mgb probe assay was developed to discriminate between type 2-based vaccines and field strains of canine parvovirus cpv considering that most of the cpv vaccines contain the old type 2 no longer circulating in canine population two mgb probes specific for cpv-2 and the antigenic variants types 2a 2b and 2c respectively were labeled with different fluorophores the mgb probe assay was able to discriminate correctly between the old type and the variants with a detection limit of 10 1 dna copies and a good reproducibility quantitation of the viral dna loads was accurate as demonstrated by comparing the cpv dna titres to those calculated by means of the taqman assay recognising all cpv types this assay will ensure resolution of most diagnostic problems in dogs showing cpv disease shortly after cpv vaccination although it does not discriminate between field strains and type 2b-based vaccines recently licensed to market in some countries
the recently described novel gyroviruses may infect chickens and/or humans however their pathogenic potential is unknown in our metagenomic investigation we detected many of the novel gyroviruses in the fecal viromes of ferrets with lymph node and organ enlargement the complete genomic sequences of selected gyrovirus strains showed 90.7-99.4 % similarity to homologous reference gyrovirus strains this study did not demonstrate an association between gyrovirus shedding from ferrets and the observed background disease however it provides evidence for genetic diversity among gyroviruses and raises the possibility that pet ferrets may transmit gyroviruses to heterologous hosts e g humans
from 206 1 uriae collected in the seabird colonies at runde norway two identical virus strains demonstrating no antigenic relationships to major arbovirus groups were isolated the new strains demonstrated a corona-virus like morphology haemagglutinated chicken red cells and were sensitive to sodium desoxycholate multiplication with cpe was demonstrated in bhk 21/c13 and bscd cells and without cpe in vero and gmk cell cultures the mouse pathogenicity was relative]y low in gel precipitation three to five specific lines were seen precipitating antibodies have been found in seabird species commonly infested by i uriae the ecological circumstances of the isolates indicate an earlier unrecognized arbovirus circulating between seabirds and i uriae this corona-like virus has been tentatively termed runde virus
rearing early weaned piglets artificially for the purposes of increasing the efficiency of the sow is an attractive management concept however high death losses resulting from diarrhea in artificially reared piglets have dampered enthusiasm for early weaning enterotoxigenic escherichia coli transmissible gastroenteritis virus and rotavirus are the three main enteropathogens responsible for causing the diarrhea the enteropathogens infect the small intestine which produces a secretory or malabsorptive diarrhea in nature the nursing piglet is protected from the enteropathogens by antibody bathing his gut the source of the antibody is the dam's colostrum and milk it should be possible to protect artificially reared early weaned piglets from enteropathogens by feeding them diets that contain antibodies to putative enteropathogens
polyomaviruses pyvs are known to infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates and are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases including cancers particularly in immune-suppressed hosts a novel polyomavirus designated rat polyomavirus 2 ratpyv2 was identified from a breeding colony of rats having x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency using a human panpolyomavirus immunohistochemistry test p-pit ratpyv2 was initially detected in the parotid salivary gland of a colony member rolling circle amplification using dna from harderian and parotid glands identified a novel 5.1-kb polyomavirus genome closely related to human washington university wu and karolinska institute ki and vole polyomaviruses but notably divergent from rattus norvegicus pyv1 rnorpyv1 also designated ratpyv1 further screening showed ratpyv2 inclusion body infection in the lung epithelium and variably in other respiratory reproductive and glandular tissues of 12/12 100% rats importance although p-pit was developed to detect diseases associated with known human polyomaviruses the identification of a new polyomavirus in rats suggests that it may have utility as a broad-based screen for new as well as known polyomaviruses our findings suggest that ratpyv2 may be a commensal infection of laboratory rats that can lead to disseminated disease in t cell immune-deficient rats infection of the x-scid rats with ratpyv2 and pneumocystis carinii is a potential model for coinfection pathogenesis and treatment options during transplant preclinical studies

major histocompatibility complex antigens are critical to an animal's immune response in most animals the extreme polymorphism of mhc molecules complicates studies of the role of this complex in the immune response in mice however mhc haplotype-homozygous inbred strains have been developed which are invaluable in the study of the immune system and the search for immune response genes the human mhc bears many similarities to its murine equivalent with regard to antigen structure and polymorphism furthermore a number of combinations of specific mhc alleles between hla-b and hla-dr/dq extended haplotypes are found in people more commonly than predicted by individual allele frequencies over 30 percent of caucasian haplotypes are extended haplotypes and over 55 percent of individuals have at least one extended haplotype examples of the same extended haplotype even in unrelated individuals should either all have or lack any gene within the mhc region the value of considering extended haplotypes in searching for associations between the mhc and diseases or immune response is shown in three examples congenital adrenal hyperplasia hepatitis b immunization and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease
several recent studies have reported that various bat species harbor bat hepatitis e viruses bathev belonging to the family hepeviridae which also contains human hepatitis e virus hev the distribution and ecology of bathev are not well known here we collected and screened 81 bat fecal samples from nine bat species in japan to detect bathev rna by rt-pcr using hev-specific primers and detected three positive samples sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these three viruses were bathevs belonging to genus orthohepevirus d like other bathev strains reported earlier in various countries these data support the first detection of bathevs in japanese microbats indicating their wide geographical distribution among multiple bat species
background the nasal avian schistosome trichobilharzia regenti spends part of its intravertebrate period of life within the central nervous system migration of the parasites can be accompanied by neuromotor disorders or paralysis in natural definitive hosts ducks and even in laboratory mammals cercariae are also able to penetrate human skin and induce cercarial dermatitis while the cellular and antibody responses against cercariae and migrating schistosomula have been investigated in mice little is known about immune reactions in birds this study first describes the dynamics of antibody response in infected ducks and identifies frequently recognized antigens that may serve as diagnostic markers of infection by t regenti methods groups of 35 domestic ducks and 10 mallards were exposed to different doses of t regenti cercariae sera were collected at predefined time intervals and tested by elisa for the presence of specific anti-cercarial igy and igm antigens recognized by the antibodies were identified on western blots of cercariae and schistosomula the applicability in immunodiagnostics was statistically evaluated by expression of specificity and sensitivity values for individual antigens results in elisa the levels of anti-cercarial igm peaked on day 15 pi increased production of igy associated with the later phases of infection was observed in most individuals around 20 dpi and culminated 30 dpi the time course of antibody response did not differ among experimental groups variations were only observed in the levels of specific igy which depended rather on the age of ducks at the time of infection than on the infectious dose on western blots 40 cercarial and 7 schistosomular antigens were recognized by igy from infected ducks among them 4 cercarial antigens of 50 47 32 and 19 kda provided the most sensitive and specific reactions conclusions antigens of cercariae and schistosomula elicited distinct antibody response in ducks which correlated positively with the age of animals at the time of infection several antigens originating in cercariae and fewer in schistosomula were recognized by igy with diverse sensitivity and specificity only a few seemed to be common to both stages four of them were considered as the most promising candidates for immunodiagnostics
ebola virus ebov infections cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans resulting in up to 90% mortality ebov outbreaks are sporadic and unpredictable in nature therefore a vaccine that is able to provide durable immunity is needed to protect those who are at risk of exposure to the virus this study assesses the long-term efficacy of the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-based vaccine vsv g/ebovgp in two rodent models of ebov infection mice and guinea pigs were first immunized with 2 × 10 4 or 2 × 10 5 plaque forming units pfu of vsv g/ebovgp respectively challenge of mice with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted ebov ma-ebov at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination provided complete protection and 80% 12 of 15 survivors protection at 12 months after vaccination challenge of guinea pigs with a lethal dose of guinea pig-adapted ebov ga-ebov at 7 12 and 18 months after vaccination resulted in 83% 5 of 6 survivors at 7 months after vaccination and 100% survival at 12 and 18 months after vaccination no weight loss or clinical signs were observed in the surviving animals antibody responses were analyzed using sera from individual rodents levels of ebov glycoprotein-specific igg antibody measured immediately before challenge appeared to correlate with protection these studies confirm that vaccination with vsv g/ebovgp is able to confer long-term protection against ebola infection in mice and guinea pigs and support follow-up studies in non-human primates crown
hepatitis c virus hcv is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models the systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology we have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses including sera and organs from 4770 rodents 41 species and sera from 2939 bats 51 species three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 1.8% of 1465 european bank voles myodes glareolus and 10 1.9% of 518 south african four-striped mice rhabdomys pumilio bats showed anti-hcv immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled rna detection using the broadly reactive pcr assays developed for this study 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested yielding further horseassociated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats the rodent viruses were equidistant to hcv exceeding by far the diversity of hcv and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together five full genomes were sequenced representing all viral lineages salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses quantitative rt-pcr rna in-situ hybridisation and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis c recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4% respectively antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with hcv nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus co-occurrence of rna and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 pcr-positive bank vole sera 5.3%. our data enable new hypotheses regarding hcv evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for hcv
immunological impairment by porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 infection is well documented in pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome nonetheless little is known about immune status of pigs that remain pcv2 subclinically infected thus seven pigs successfully infected in an experimental inoculation and without developing disease and nine control non-inoculated pigs were examined serological virological and immunological determinations were done throughout ten weeks post-infection pi at week 3 pi inoculated animals presented the peak of viremia and produced higher levels of il-10 than the controls correlation between viral load and il-10 amounts was observed p < 0.05 also the ratio igm/igg suffered a shift skewing igm production towards an igg response by 10 weeks pi levels of il-10 disappeared and the viremia decreased in summary subclinically pcv2-infected pigs developed a transient pcv2-specific il-10 response during the viremic phase of infection which coincided with the inversion of the igm/igg ratio
the aim of this study was to establish a reliable method of virus detection for the diagnosis of critical enterovirus infections such as acute infective encephalitis encephalomyelitis and myocarditis because histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin-embedded tissues play an important role in recognizing infectious agents in tissue samples six in-house polyclonal antibodies raised against three representative enteroviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry were examined this panel of polyclonal antibodies recognized three serotypes of enterovirus two of the polyclonal antibodies were raised against denatured virus particles from enterovirus a71 one was raised against the recombinant vp1 protein of coxsackievirus b3 and the other for poliovirus type 1 were raised against denatured virus particles the recombinant vp1 protein and peptide 2c western blot analysis revealed that each of these antibodies recognized the corresponding viral antigen and none cross-reacted with non-enteroviruses within the family picornaviridae however all cross-reacted to some extent with the antigens derived from other serotypes of enterovirus indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that the virus capsid and non-structural proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of affected culture cells and skeletal muscles and neurons in neonatal mice experimentallyinfected with human enterovirus the antibodies also recognized antigens derived from recent clinical isolates of enterovirus a71 coxsackievirus b3 and poliovirus in addition immunohistochemistry revealed that representative antibodies tested showed the same recognition pattern according to each serotype thus the panel of in-house anti-enterovirus polyclonal antibodies described herein will be an important tool for the screening and pathological diagnosis for enterovirus infections and may be useful for the classification of different enterovirus serotypes including coxsackieviruses a and b echoviruses enterovirus a71 and poliovirus

the development of synthetic peptide-based vaccines has many advantages in comparison with vaccines based on live attenuated organisms inactivated or killed organism or toxins peptide-based vaccines cannot revert to a virulent form allow a better conservation and are produced more easily and safely however they generate a weaker immune response than other vaccines and the inclusion of adjuvants and/or the use of vaccine delivery systems is almost always needed among vaccine delivery systems micro-and nanoparticulated ones are attractive because their particulate nature can increase cross-presentation of the peptide in addition they can be passively or actively targeted to antigen presenting cells furthermore particulate adjuvants are able to directly activate innate immune system in vivo here we summarize micro-and nanoparticulated vaccine delivery systems used in the field of synthetic peptide-based vaccines as well as strategies to increase their immunogenicity
canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a multi-factorial infection that affects many kennelled dogs despite the wide use of vaccination current vaccines aim to protect against viral agents and a single bacterial agent bordetella bronchiseptica we sought to examine the role of streptococcal species in cird the isolation and identification of streptococci in the lower respiratory tract of clinically healthy dogs and those with cird were used to correlate the presence of specific streptococcal species with respiratory disease in this study we report that the presence of s equi subsp zooepidemicus is associated with increasing severity of disease in a population of kennelled dogs with endemic cird
diseases may play major roles in the conservation of endangered species although the threat of disease received extensive consideration and influenced research and management activities governing the endangered black-footed f m e t mustela nigripes in wyoming a canine distemper epizootic in 1985 severely affected a captive breeding program and led to extirpation of the species from the wild this recent example of the catastrophic effect of epizootic disease in an endangered species is described in an historical context in addition examples are given of disease further endangering other rare species including mauritius pink pigeon pere david's deer cranes maned wolves native hawaiian birak cheetahs and others
canine monocytic ehrlichiosis cme is a serious tick-borne rickettsial disease affecting canine populations globally besides few reports from stray and pet dogs from localised geographical regions cities/towns/small states a comprehensive study on prevalence of ehrlichia canis e canis among working dogs from different geoclimatic zones of india was pertinently lacking study of cme among these dog populations was thus carried out encompassing clinical aspects and different diagnostic methodologies viz microscopy serology and molecular biology during the two-year study period clinical specimens from 225 cases suspected of canine ehrlichiosis were examined for clinical pathology and presence of the haemoparasites overall prevalence of ehrlichiosis by microscopic examination commercial dot-elisa kit and nested pcr assay was estimated to be 1.3% 19.1% and 5.8% respectively which were found to be statistically significant by mcnemar chi squared test p < 0.05 it was also observed that possibly due to widespread use of doxycycline therapy in field cme presently does not remain a potential threat which it uses to pose earlier however concurrent infections of e canis and babesia gibsoni were found to be mostly fatal keeping in view of high number of apparently healthy dogs 24 out of total positive cases 46 observed during the study it is recommended that prevalence studies on cme should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs phylogenetic analysis carried on partial sequencing of 16s rrna of e canis strains revealed that all of the indian strains clustered in a single clade with other e canis species from india and rest of the world molecular divergence was observed among the sequences of brazilian and american isolates which were also included in the present study these findings have thus opened a new paradigm for planning of pragmatic control strategies against cme
a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is being intensively pursued against its re-emergence we generated a sars coronavirus sars-cov spike protein-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus rvv-s using highly attenuated strain lc16m8 intradermal administration of rvv-s into rabbits induced neutralizing nt antibodies against sars-cov 1 week after administration and the nt titer reached 11000 after boost immunization with rvv-s significantly nt antibodies against sars-cov were induced by administration of rvv-s to rabbits that had been pre-immunized with lc16m8 rvv-s can induce nt antibodies against sars-cov despite the presence of nt antibodies against vv these results suggest that rvv-s may be a powerful sars vaccine including in patients previously immunized with the smallpox vaccine
attenuated salmonella typhimurium s typhimurium was selected as a transgenic vehicle for the development of live mucosal vaccines against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev based on the m gene an approximate 1.0 kb dna fragment encoding for glycoprotein m was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pvax1 the recombinant plasmid pvax-m was transformed by electroporation into attenuated s typhimurium sl7207 and the expression and translation of the pvax-m delivered by recombinant s typhimurium sl7207 pvax-m was detected both in vitro and in vivo balb/c mice were inoculated orally with sl7207 pvax-m at different dosages to evaluate safety of the vaccines the bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 9 10 9 cfu almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6 mice immunized with 1 9 10 9 cfu of sl7207 pvax-m elicited specific anti-tgev local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of iga igg il-4 and ifn-c as measured by indirect elisa assay moreover the control groups pvax group pbs group maintained at a normal level during week 4-8 post-immunization the results indicated that attenuated s typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of tgev m gene vaccine
the presence of giardia and cryptosporidium was investigated in 274 faecal samples of alpacas vicugna pacos from 12 herds from peru by immunofluorescence microscopy and pcr amplification and sequencing of fragments of the ssu-rrna and ␤-giardin genes from giardia spp as well as the ssu-rrna gene from cryptosporidium spp a total of 137 samples 50.0% were positive for giardia spp and 12 samples 4.4% for cryptosporidium spp in ten samples 3.6% co-infection by both pathogens was found herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% 11/12 herds for giardia and 58.3% 7/12 herds for cryptosporidium regarding the age of the animals although giardia was detected in animals as young as 1 week the prevalence increased with age reaching 80% by 8 weeks similarly the highest percentage of cryptosporidium detection 20% was also found in the 8 week-old group by pcr 92 of the 274 analysed samples were positive for giardia sequencing of the amplicons showed the existence of giardia duodenalis assemblage a in 67 samples g duodenalis assemblage e in 24 samples and inconsistent results between the two molecular markers used in a further sample cryptosporidium was only detected by pcr in 3 of the 274 samples cryptosporidium parvum was identified in two samples and cryptosporidium ubiquitum in one sample this study is the first performing molecular characterisation of both parasites in peruvian alpacas and the first report of c ubiquitum in this host the identification of g duodenalis assemblage a c parvum and c ubiquitum suggests that zoonotic transmission of these enteropathogens between alpacas and humans is possible

viruses cause a large number of diseases in humans some of which are fatal while others are highly debilitating a majority of viral diseases attack infants and young children while others strike people in their prime development of preventive measures against viral diseases is therefore of paramount importance vaccination is the most cost-effective medical intervention for preventing mortality and morbidity against infectious diseases a number of effective and safe vaccines are currently available against several viral diseases of significant medical importance many of these manufactured in india are at par with international standards and are affordable for many other viral diseases for which vaccines are currently not available research is underway at various national laboratories as well as in the private sector companies in india the present overview highlights the various vaccine preventable viral diseases that are of special importance to india and aims to provide a glimpse of the various vaccines that are currently available or are under development in india india has a strong presence in the global vaccine scenario currently there are at least 13 major vaccine manufacturers in the country with the number steadily increasing india is a major importer as well as exporter of vaccines with the indian market for vaccines being valued at over usd
there are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus in hubei province that caused the covid-19 pandemic including 1 the relationship of the new virus to the sars-related coronaviruses 2 the role of bats as a reservoir species 3 the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event and 4 the role of recombination in viral emergence here we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses -the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 -exhibit frequent recombination but the sars-cov-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date in order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between sars-cov-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on hcov-oc43 and mers-cov evolutionary rates divergence dates between sars-cov-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 95% hpd 1879 -1999 1969 95% hpd 1930-2000 and 1982 95% hpd 1948 -2009 . despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since sars the lineage giving rise to sars-cov-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins the occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again./ 25the betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history we characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of sars-cov-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982. ratg13 is the closest available bat virus to sars-cov-2 a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans two sister lineages of the ratg13/sars-cov-2 lineage infect malayan pangolins. the sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity the sarbecoviruses are efficient 'explorers' of phenotype space. the sars-cov-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date. non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed we constructed three such regions using different methods. we estimate that ratg13 and sars-cov-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago there is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats. while an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats./ 25
hendra virus hev and nipah virus niv are closely related recently emerged paramyxoviruses that form henipavirus genus and are capable of causing considerable morbidity and mortality in a number of mammalian species including humans however in contrast to many other species and despite expression of functional virus entry receptors mice are resistant to henipavirus infection we report here the susceptibility of mice deleted for the type i interferon receptor ifnar-ko to both hev and niv intraperitoneally infected mice developed fatal encephalitis with pathology and immunohistochemical features similar to what was found in humans viral rna was found in the majority of analyzed organs and sublethally infected animals developed virus-specific neutralizing antibodies altogether these results reveal ifnar-ko mice as a new small animal model to study hev and niv pathogenesis prophylaxis and treatment and suggest the critical role of type i interferon signaling in the control of henipavirus infection

severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by infection with a novel coronavirus sars-cov was the first major novel infectious disease at the beginning of the 21st century with china especially affected sars was characterized by high infectivity morbidity and mortality and the confined pattern of the disease spreading among the countries of south-east and east asia suggested the existence of susceptible factors in these populations studies in the populations of hong kong and taiwan showed an association of human leucocyte antigen hla polymorphisms with the development and/or severity of sars respectively the aim of the present study was to define the genotypic patterns of hla-a -b and -drb1 loci in sars patients and a co-resident population of guangdong province southern china where the first sars case was reported the samples comprised 95 cases of recovered sars patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls hla -a -b and -drb1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers the severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung infiltration usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of lymphocytopenia although the allelic frequencies of a23 a34 b60 drb1*12 in the sars group were slightly higher and a33 -b58 and -b61 were lower than in the controls no statistical significance was found when the pc value was considered similarly no association of hla alleles with the severity of the disease was detected thus variations in the major histocompatibility complex are unlikely to have contributed significantly to either the susceptibility or the severity of sars in the population of guangdong
antibodies and their derivatives are the most important agents in therapeutics and diagnostics even after the significant progress in the technology for antibody screening from huge libraries it takes a long time to isolate an antibody which prevents a prompt action against the spread of a disease here we report a new strategy for isolating desired antibodies from a combinatorial library in one day by repeated fluorescence-activated cell sorting facs first we constructed a library of synthetic human antibody in which single-chain variable fragment scfv was expressed in the periplasm of escherichia coli after labeling the cells with fluorescent antigen probes the highly fluorescent cells were sorted by using a high-speed cell sorter and these cells were reused without regeneration in the next round of sorting after repeating this sorting the positive clones were completely enriched in several hours thus we screened the library against three viral antigens including the h1n1 influenza virus hepatitis b virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus finally the potential antibody candidates which show k d values between 10 and 100 nm against the target antigens could be successfully isolated even though the library was relatively small 10 6 . these results show that repeated facs screening without regeneration of the sorted cells can be a powerful method when a rapid response to a spreading disease is required
background the current study was conducted to establish animal models including mouse and ferret for the novel avian-origin h7n9 influenza virus findings a/anhui/1/2013 h7n9 virus was administered by intranasal instillation to groups of mice and ferrets and animals developed typical clinical signs including body weight loss mice and ferrets ruffled fur mice sneezing ferrets and death mice peak virus shedding from respiratory tract was observed on 2 days post inoculation d p i for mice and 3-5 d p i for ferrets virus could also be detected in brain liver spleen kidney and intestine from inoculated mice and in heart liver and olfactory bulb from inoculated ferrets the inoculation of h7n9 could elicit seroconversion titers up to 1280 in ferrets and 160 in mice leukopenia significantly reduced lymphocytes but increased neutrophils were also observed in mouse and ferret models the mouse and ferret model enables detailed studies of the pathogenesis of this illness and lay the foundation for drug or vaccine evaluation
deciphering the dynamic changes of antibodies against sars-cov-2 is essential for understanding the immune response in covid-19 patients by comprehensively analyzing the laboratory findings of 1850 patients we describe the dynamic changes of the total antibody spike protein s- receptor-binding domain rbd- and nucleoprotein n-specific igm and igg levels during sars-cov-2 infection and recovery our results indicate that the s- rbd- and n-specific igg generation of severe/critical covid-19 patients is one week later than mild/moderate cases while the levels of these antibodies are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during hospitalization p<0.01 the decrease of these igg levels indicates the poor outcome of severe/critical patients the rbd-and s-specific igg levels are 2-fold higher in virus-free patients p<0.05 notably we found that the patients who got re-infected had a low level of protective antibody on discharge therefore our evidence proves that the dynamic changes of antibodies could provide an important reference for diagnosis monitoring and treatment and shed new light on the precise management of pneumonia of china" added that sars-cov-2 specific igm and igg antibody levels could be used to diagnose the suspected cases the antibody detection is more simple and faster than the virus rna load test and the specimen is more stable and easier to store 7 . thus antibody tests can provide an important complementary for the diagnosis of covid-19 in addition the generation and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies against all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission
bacteriophages are among the most numerous creatures on earth and they are omnipresent they are thus in constant natural contact with humans and animals however the clinical and technological use of bacteriophages has also become more frequent which is why all aspects of phage-mammal interactions need to be explored bacteriophages are able to interact with mammalian phagocytes they may inhibit the phagocytosis of bacteria but they may also undergo phagocytosis themselves the ability of bacteriophages to reduce reactive oxygen species production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of bacteria or their endotoxins was also confirmed studies show that the high immunogenicity of bacteriophages may also be employed in anti-tumor treatment the present knowledge of phage interactions with cellular components of the mammalian immune system is sparse and insufficient especially considering the increasing interest in the application of these viruses in human life we believe that continuation of such research is indispensable
a nephropathogenic k2/01 strain of infectious bronchitis virus ibv was attenuated by 170 serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs for possible use as a future ibv vaccine strain high-growth properties and narrow tissue tropisms limited replication in respiratory tracts were achieved by the adaptation process unlike the parent strain the attenuated strain k2p170 was safe in day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks since replication of the virus did not induce mortality and nephritis and rarely induced histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular administration in day-old broilers even though coarse spray administration of k2p170 induced clinical signs ciliostasis and histopathological lesions in the trachea and the kidney they were all comparable to birds vaccinated with commercial h120 vaccine despite restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract k2p170 elicited the production of antiserum with a neutralization index of 4.5 k2p170 provided almost complete protection against both two distinct subgroups of korean nephropathogenic strain km91-like and qx-like subgroup furthermore k2p170 provided significantly greater cross-protection against two heterologous strains massachusetts and korean respiratory strain than those conferred by the commercial h120 vaccine k2p170 also had no virulence reversion after five back passages in chickens in conclusion k2p170 exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity possesses cross-protective efficacy and merits further investigation as a potential live vaccine as an alternative means of protection against the recently emergent nephropathogenic ibv infection in many eurasian countries
a b s t r a c t nucleocapsid n protein gene of turkey coronavirus tcov was expressed in a prokaryotic system and used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for detection of antibody to tcov anti-tcov hyperimmune turkey serum and normal turkey serum were used as positive or negative controls for optimization of the elisa goat anti-turkey igg h+l conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as detector antibody three hundred and twenty two turkey sera from the field were used to evaluate the performance of elisa and determine the cut-off point of elisa the established elisa was also examined with serum samples obtained from turkeys experimentally infected with tcov those serum samples were collected at various time intervals from 1 to 63 days post-infection the optimum conditions for differentiation between anti-tcov hyperimmune serum and normal turkey serum were recombinant tcov n protein concentration at 20 g/ml serum dilution at 1800 and conjugate dilution at 110000 of the 322 sera from the field 101 were positive for tcov by immunofluorescent antibody assay ifa the sensitivity and specificity of the elisa relative to ifa test were 86.0% and 96.8% respectively using the optimum cut-off point of 0.2 as determined by logistic regression method reactivity of anti-rotavirus anti-reovirus anti-adenovirus or anti-enterovirus antibodies with the recombinant n protein coated on the elisa plates was not detected these results indicated that the established antibody-capture elisa in conjunction with recombinant tcov n protein as the coating protein can be utilized for detection of antibodies to tcov in turkey flocks
a simple and rapid immunochromatographic assay ica to detect satsuma dwarf virus sdv was developed using colloidal gold conjugates of anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies of six homogenization buffers tested 0.1 m citrate buffer ph 7.0 gave the best results for the ica in the ica addition of 0.1% thioglycolic acid in the homogenization buffers that have been widely used in enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa was deleterious to the reaction because of undesirable coagulation of the colloidal gold ica using the anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies was 8 times and 16 times more sensitive than double antibody sandwich-elisa and ica using the anti-sdv polyclonal antibody respectively the analysis is complete in only 15 min furthermore ica using the anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies could also detect sdv-related viruses
more than 50 emerging and reemerging pathogens have been identified during the last 40 years until 1992 when the institute of medicine issued a report that defined emerging infectious diseases medicine had been complacent about such infectious diseases despite the alarm bells of infections with human immunodeficiency virus molecular tools have proven useful in discovering and characterizing emerging viruses and bacteria such as sin nombre virus hantaviral pulmonary syndrome hepatitis c virus bartonella henselae cat scratch disease bacillary angiomatosis and anaplasma phagocytophilum human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis the feasibility of applying molecular diagnostics to dangerous fastidious and uncultivated agents for which conventional tests do not yield timely diagnoses has achieved proof of concept for many agents but widespread use of costeffective validated commercial assays has yet to occur this review presents representative emerging viral respiratory infections hemorrhagic fevers and hepatitides as well as bacterial and parasitic zoonotic gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections agent characteristics epidemiology clinical manifestations and diagnostic methods are tabulated for another 22 emerging viruses and five emerging bacteria the ongoing challenge to the field of molecular diagnostics is to apply contemporary knowledge to facilitate agent diagnosis as well as to further discoveries of novel pathogens j mol diagn
background infections caused by canine parvovirus canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in dogs worldwide prior to this study no information was available concerning the incidence and prevalence of these viruses in cape verde archipelago results to provide information regarding the health status of the canine population in vila do maio maio island cape verde 53 rectal swabs were collected from 53 stray dogs during 2010 and 93 rectal swabs and 88 blood samples were collected from 125 stray dogs in 2011 all rectal swabs 2010 n = 53 2011 n = 93 were analysed for the presence of canine parvovirus canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus nucleic acids by quantitative pcr methods specific antibodies against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus were also assessed 2011 n = 88 from the 2010 sampling 43.3% 23/53 were positive for canine parvovirus dna 11.3% 6/53 for canine distemper virus rna and 1.9% 1/53 for canine coronavirus rna in 2011 the prevalence values for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus were quite similar to those from the previous year respectively 44.1% 41/93 and 1.1% 1/93 but canine distemper virus was not detected in any of the samples analysed 0% 0/93 antibodies against canine parvovirus were detected in 71.6% 63/88 blood samples and the seroprevalence found for canine distemper virus was 51.1% 45/88 conclusions this study discloses the data obtained in a molecular and serological epidemiological surveillance carried out in urban populations of stray and domestic animals virus transmission and spreading occurs easily in large dog populations leading to high mortality rates particularly in unvaccinated susceptible animals in addition these animals can act as disease reservoirs for wild animal populations by occasional contact identification of susceptible wildlife of maio island is of upmost importance to evaluate the risk of pathogen spill over from domestic to wild animals in cape verde and to evaluate the associated threat to the wild susceptible species
stools from 266 children in four districts of lesotho were examined for viruses by electron microscopy em over a 5-week period eighty one 30.5% of the children shed coronavirus-like particles cvlps shedding was not significantly associated with diarrhea the proportion of children shedding these particles increased with increasing age in one district the prevalence of cvlp shedding 67.9% was at least twice the prevalence in any of the other three districts this was the only district to be sampled during the first week of the study it was shown that the proportion of children shedding cvlps declined during each of the 5 weeks of study the stools of six children who shed cvlps in the early summer of 1984-85 were negative by em 5 months later there was no association between the shedding of pathogenic bacteria or parasites and the presence or absence of cvlps in the stool
influenza viruses are among the most important human pathogens and are responsible for annual epidemics and sporadic potentially devastating pandemics the humoral immune response plays an important role in the defense against these viruses providing protection mainly by producing antibodies directed against the hemagglutinin ha glycoprotein however their high genetic variability allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal vaccines the emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of influenza the development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently needed in this study we describe a human monoclonal antibody pn-sia49 that recognizes a highly conserved epitope located on the stem region of the ha and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different subtypes h1 h2 and h5 furthermore we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with h1n1 and h5n1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus infections
virus-like particles vlps are formed by the self-assembly of envelope and/or capsid proteins from many viruses in many cases such vlps have structural characteristics and antigenicity similar to the parental virus and some have already proven successful as vaccines against the cognate virus infection the structural components of some vlps have also proven amenable to the insertion or fusion of foreign antigenic sequences allowing the production of chimeric vlps exposing the foreign antigen on their surface other vlps have been used as carriers for foreign antigens including non-protein antigens via chemical conjugation this review outlines some of the advantages disadvantages and technical considerations for the use of a wide range of vlp systems in vaccine development
background aujeszky's disease is a viral disease of suids caused by suid herpesvirus 1 the disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact in serbia there is neither an aujeszky's disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs since clinical symptoms of aujeszky's disease are not specific it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of adv active infection in wild boars the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of adv and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in serbia we report the first isolation of suid herpesvirus 1 from this species in serbia results tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern serbia were examined for evidence of aujeszky's disease ad suid herpesvirus 1 shv1 the cause of ad was isolated on pk15 cell line from three tissue samples inducing cytopathic effect cpe with syncytia forming and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction pcr in eight samples genetic analysis of us4 us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between adv isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test vnt in sera from four out of eight pcr positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals conclusions this is the first demonstration of aujeszky's disease virus adv in the wild boar population in serbia although seroconversion has been detected previously
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcv cause indistinguishable clinical signs and pathological changes in swine here we investigated the antigenic relationship between pedv and pdcv we provide the first evidence that conserved epitopes on the respective viral nucleocapsid proteins cross-react with each other although virus neutralization cross-reactivity was not observed as a practical matter prevention of these two very similar diseases of swine will require the development of separate virus-specific vaccine products
dna vaccination has tremendous potential for treating or preventing numerous diseases for which traditional vaccines are ineffective but the technique can be limited by low immunogenicity current synthetic dna delivery systems are versatile and safe but substantially less efficient than viruses here a novel multicomponent supramolecular system involving the preparation of mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers microspheres with entrapping complexes of dna vaccine and polyethylenimine was developed to mimic many of the beneficial properties of the viruses after delivery by intramuscular immunization in balb/c mice the microspheres induced an enhanced serum antibody responses two orders of magnitude greater than naked dna vaccine additionally in contrast to naked dna the microspheres induced potent cytotoxic t lymphocyte responses at a low dose consequently formulation of dna vaccines into multicomponent vectors is a powerful means of increasing vaccine potency r
a causative agent provisionally designated as cars was isolated from the enlarged submaxillary gland of rat which was characterized as a sialoadenitis using mouse-derived balb/e 3 t 3 clone a 31 3 t 3 cell culture the virus could be propagated in 3t3 cell culture where it produced multinucleated giant ceils and formed clear plaques i t was identified as a member of the coronavirus group from the following results rna content was suggested by the lack of the effect of cytosine arabinoside the infectivity was sensitive to lipid solvents and inactivated at 56°c for 5 minutes the viral particle showed typical coronavirus morphology which was approximately 100 nm in diameter serologically although cars and sialodacryoadenitis virus sdav actually belonged to the rat-coronavirus group some antigenic variations existed between these two agents in the results of both neutralization and complement-fixation tests using monovalent antisera when inoculated intranasally into susceptible rats cars caused clinically and histologically overt sialoadenitis as observed in the natural outbreak and retained its virulence for rats in several passages of mouse brain and even when ceil culture was used while rats which were inoculated with sdav were asymptomatie
bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses including coronaviruses covs that cause serious disease in humans and agricultural animals these include covs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers porcine epidemic diarrhea ped and severe acute diarrhea syndrome sads bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease these observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several covs in this review we follow the cov outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats we review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor covs without severe disease we speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of covs and factors that enable these viruses to "jump" from bats to other mammals we hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infection causes severe diarrhea in piglets and imposes a significant economic burden on pig farms single-chain fragment variable scfv antibodies effectively inhibit virus infection and could be a potential therapeutic reagent for preventing disease in this study a recombinant scfv antibody phage display library was constructed from peripheral blood lymphocytes of piglets infected with tgev the library was screened with four rounds of biopanning using purified tgev antigen and scfv antibodies that bound to tgev were obtained the scfv gene was subcloned into the pet-28a+ and the constituted plasmid was introduced into escherichia coli bl21 de3 for protein expression all three scfv clones identified had neutralizing activity against tgev an immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis demonstrated that two scfv antibodies reacted with the spike protein of tgev these results indicate that scfv antibodies provide protection against viral infection in vitro and may be a therapeutic candidate for both prevention and treatment of tgev infection in swine
china is thought to be a hotspot for zoonotic influenza virus emergence yet there have been few prospective studies examining the occupational risks of such infections methods we present the first 2 years of data collected from a 5-year prospective cohort study of swine-exposed and -unexposed participants at 6 swine farms in china we conducted serological and virological surveillance to examine evidence for swine influenza a virus infection in humans results of the 658 participants 521 swine-exposed and 137 swine-unexposed 207 31.5% seroconverted against at least 1 swine influenza virus subtype swine h1n1 or h3n2 swine-exposed participants' microneutralization titers especially those enrolled at confined animal feeding operations cafos were higher against the swine h1n1 virus than were other participants at 12 and 24 months despite elevated titers among the 187 study subjects for whom we had complete follow-up participants working at swine cafos had significantly greater odds of seroconverting against both the swine h1n1 odds ratio 19.16 95% confidence interval 3.55-358.65 and swine h3n2 or 2.97 95% ci 1.16-8.01 viruses compared to unexposed and non-cafo swine workers with less intense swine exposure conclusions while some of the observed increased risk against swine viruses may have been explained by exposure to human influenza strains study data suggest that even with elevated preexisting antibodies swine-exposed workers were at high risk of infection with enzootic swine influenza a viruses
nipah virus niv causes a severe and often fatal neurological disease in humans whilst fruit bats are considered the natural reservoir niv also infects pigs and may cause an unapparent or mild disease direct pig-to-human transmission was responsible for the first and still most devastating niv outbreaks in malaysia and singapore in 1998-99 with nearly 300 human cases and over 100 fatalities pigs can therefore play a key role in the epidemiology of niv by acting as an "amplifying" host the outbreak in singapore ended with the prohibition of pig imports from malaysia and the malaysian outbreak was ended by culling 45% of the country's pig population with costs exceeding us$500 million despite the importance of niv as an emerging disease with the potential for pandemic no vaccines or therapeutics are currently approved for human or livestock use in this mini-review we will discuss current knowledge of niv infection in pigs our ongoing work to develop a niv vaccine for use in pigs and the pig as a model to support human vaccine development
dengue virus denv a re-emerging virus constitutes the largest vector-borne disease virus with 50-100 million cases reported every year although denv infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of the same serotypes the subsequent infection with the heterologous serotypes can cause more severe form of the disease such as dengue haemorrhagic fever dhf or dengue shock syndrome dss however there is neither approved vaccine nor specific drugs available to treat this disease in this study previously developed 19 human monoclonal antibodies humabs showing strong to moderate cross neutralizing activity were selected most of them 13/19 were targeted to domain ii of envelop glycoprotein to understand and clarify the recognition properties the maturation mechanisms comprising variable/diversity/joining vdj recombination variable heavy vh/variable light vl chain pairing variability at junctional site and somatic hypermutation shm of those antibodies were studied and compared with their predecessor germline sequences imgt/v-quest database was applied to analyze the isolated vh and vl sequences to confirm the correction of isolated vh/vl 3 humabs 1a10h7 1b3b9 1g7c2 was transiently expressed in hek293t cell all three clones of the expressed recombinant igg rigg showed the same binding and neutralizing activity as same as those from hybridomas the data obtained in this study will elucidate the properties of those humabs for further genetic modification and its binding epitopes

serum antibodies against human coronavirus oc43 in different age groups were measured by complement fixation cf haemagglutination inhibition hi radial diffusion haemolysis-in-gel hig and solid-phase radioimmunoassay ria methods antigen grown in suckling mouse brain was used in all tests results obtained by the cf and hig tests and the ria were in good agreement with regard t o the presence or absence of antibodies similar results were also obtained with the hi test if nonspecific haemagglutination inhibitors were first removed by treatment with phospholipase c and only titers of 1 20 or greater were considered positive children 6-23 months of age n = 45 were without measurable coronavirus antibodies in all four assays a rapid increase in the prevalence of antibodies then occurred in subsequent age groups and practically all persons 6 years of age or older were found t o have oc43 antibodies as measured by the hig test or the ria the mean antibody levels determined by these two methods continued t o increase however up t o the age group of 10-14 years this increase in antibody levels after the initial antibody incidence plateau may be due t o boosting effects caused by related coronavirus strains since oc43 antigens are known t o cross-react with antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses taken together these data suggest that oc43 virus or an antigenically related coronavirus strain is very common in finland
newcastle disease virus ndv causes morbidities and mortalities in wild and domestic birds globally for humans exposure to infected birds can cause conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms ndv infections in mammals are rarely reported in this study using next-generation sequencing an ndv was identified and isolated from vero cells inoculated with the nasal swab of an aborted dromedary fetus in dubai during the time when an ndv outbreak occurred in a pigeon farm located in close proximity to the dairy camel farm where the mother of the aborted dromedary fetus resided and there were a lot of pigeons in the camel farm genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features of other ndvs were also present in this dromedary ndv genome phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of fusion protein f hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein hn and complete polyprotein showed that the virus belonged to sub-genotype vig of class ii ndv and is most closely related to pigeon ndvs in egypt in the same year the present study is the first that demonstrated isolation of ndv in dromedaries further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between ndv infection and abortion
although the majority of emerging infectious diseases can be linked to wildlife sources most pathogen spillover events to people could likely be avoided if transmission was better understood and practices adjusted to mitigate risk wildlife trade can facilitate zoonotic disease transmission and represents a threat to human health and economies in asia highlighted by the 2003 sars coronavirus outbreak where a chinese wildlife market facilitated pathogen transmission additionally wildlife trade poses a serious threat to biodiversity therefore the combined impacts of asian wildlife trade sometimes termed bush meat trade on public health and biodiversity need assessing from 2010 to 2013 observational data were collected in lao pdr from markets selling wildlife including information on volume form species and price of wildlife market biosafety and visitor origin the potential for traded wildlife to host zoonotic diseases that pose a serious threat to human health was then evaluated at seven markets identified as having high volumes of trade at the seven markets during 21 observational surveys 1937 alive or fresh dead mammals approximately 1009 kg were observed for sale including mammals from 12 taxonomic families previously documented to be capable of hosting 36 zoonotic pathogens in these seven markets the combination of high wildlife volumes high risk taxa for zoonoses and poor biosafety increases the potential for pathogen presence and transmission to examine the potential conservation impact of trade in markets we assessed the status of 33752 animals observed during 375 visits to 93 markets under the lao pdr wildlife and aquatic law we observed 6452 animals listed by lao pdr as near extinct or threatened with extinction the combined risks of wildlife trade in lao pdr to human health and biodiversity highlight the need for a multi-sector approach to effectively protect public health economic interests and biodiversity wildlife trade and human health in lao pdr plos one |
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a highly contagious enteric pathogen of swine acute pedv outbreaks have continually emerged in most swine-producing asian countries and recently in the united states causing significant economic losses in the pig industry the spike s protein of pedv is a type 1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein and consists of the s1 and s2 domains which are responsible for virus binding and fusion respectively since the s1 domain is involved in a specific high-affinity interaction with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibody in the natural host it is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against pedv in this study a codon-optimized pedv s1 gene containing amino acid residues 25-738 was synthesized based on a multiple alignment of the s amino acid sequences of pedv field isolates and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the pedv s1 protein the purified recombinant s1 protein was found to mediate highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits the antibodies strongly recognized the recombinant s1 protein from cell lysates and supernatants of s1-expressing cells whereas they bound weakly to the authentic s protein of pedv vaccine strain sm98-1 furthermore a serum neutralization test revealed that the rabbit antisera completely inhibit infection of the pedv vaccine strain at a serum dilution of 116 we then tested the ability of vaccination with the recombinant s1 protein to protect piglets against pedv late-term pregnant sows were inoculated intramuscularly with the purified s1 protein and the outcome was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets after a virulent pedv challenge the results showed that vaccination with s1 protein efficiently protected neonatal piglets against pedv our data suggest that the recombinant s1 protein shows potential as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for ped prevention j oh and k.-w lee contributed equally to this work and share cofirst authors
the s1 n and m proteins obtained from the nephropathogenic n1/62 strain of infectious bronchitis virus ibv by immunoaffinity purification with monoclonal antibodies were used for immunization of chickens for all three antigens multiple immunizations were necessary for induction of an antibody response protection of chickens vaccinated with the s1 glycoprotein against virulent challenge was demonstrated by the complete absence of virus in tracheas and kidneys of vaccinated chickens following four immunizations with the s1 glycoprotein 71% and 86% of chickens were protected at the level of tracheas and kidneys respectively three immunizations with the s1 glycoprotein protected 70% and 10% of chickens at the level of kidney and trachea respectively neither the n nor the m antigen induced protection to a virulent challenge with the nephropathogenic n1/62 strain of ibv after four immunizations virus neutralizing haemagglutination inhibiting and elisa antibodies were detected in chickens immunized with the s1 glycoprotein and inactivated n1/62 virus however there was no correlation between the presence of any of these antibodies and protection
the objective of this study was to elucidate the kinetics and magnitudes of speci®c iga antibody responses in intestines of turkey poults infected with turkey coronavirus tcv turkey poults were orally inoculated with tcvat 10 days of age intestinal segment cultures were administered for duodenum jejunum and ileum and the iga antibody responses were analyzed at 1 2 3 4 6 or 9 weeks post-infection pi in two different experiments the kinetics of virus-speci®c iga antibody responses in duodenum jejunum and ileum were similar gradually increased from 1 week pi reached the peak at 3 or 4 weeks pi and declined afterward the virus-speci®c iga antibody responses in duodenum jejunum and ileum showed negative correlation with duration of tcv antigen in the corresponding locations of intestine with spearman's correlation coef®cient of à0.85 p 0034 à0.74 p 0096 and à0.75 p 0084 respectively moreover the virus-speci®c iga antibody responses in serum were positively correlated with that of duodenum coefficient 0829 p 0042 jejunum coefficient 0829 p 0042 and ileum coefficient 0771 p 0072 segment cultures suggesting that the induction of speci®c iga response in serum was predictive of an iga response in intestine the results indicate that intestinal mucosal iga antibodies to tcv are elicited in turkeys following infection with tcv the local mucosal antibodies may provide protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from tcv infection #
the study of human-specific infectious agents has been hindered by the lack of optimal small animal models more recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents the introduction of a targeted mutation in the il2 receptor common gamma chain gene il2rg null in mice already deficient in t and b cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice these humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 and other human-specific infectious agents however there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents this is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice including i modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity which impedes human cell engraftment ii genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function iii and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols the development of "next generation" humanized mouse models continues to provide exciting opportunities for the establishment of robust small animal models to study the pathogenesis of human-specific infectious agents as well as for testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents and experimental vaccines
bats are natural reservoirs for a spectrum of infectious zoonotic diseases including the recently emerged henipaviruses hendra and nipah viruses henipaviruses have been observed both naturally and experimentally to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different mammal species including humans interestingly infection of the flying fox with henipaviruses occurs in the absence of clinical disease the extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in bat cell lines we report that henipavirus infection does not result in the induction of interferon expression and the viruses also inhibit interferon signaling we also confirm that the interferon production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat hosts this information in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following henipavirus infection suggests that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism not via the interferon response this is the first report of henipavirus infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune system
the nucleoside hydrolase nh36 is the main marker of the fml complex of leishmania donovani antigen of the licensed leishmune® vaccine for prophylaxis of canine visceral leishmaniasis as a dna vaccine in mice it induces a th1 immune response we vaccinated mongrel dogs with the vr1012nh36 vaccine for prophylaxis and immunotherapy against a high dose leishmania chagasi infection 7 x 10 8 infective amastigotes the untreated controls developed more symptoms higher parasite/lymphocyte ratio smaller dth reactions lower proportions of nh36-specific cd4+ cells and sustained nh36-specific cd8+ cell counts than dogs of the prophylaxis group in the immunotherapy treated group enlarged dth reactions enhanced cd4+ and sustained cd8+ lymphocyte proportions were also detected however without reduction of symptoms or parasite/lymphocyte ratio indicating that the vaccine was sufficiently potent to prevent but not to control the disease both treatments determined higher survival rates anti-fml antibodies increased in vaccinated and control dogs while anti-nh36 antibodies were only increased in vaccinees p= 0.000 the parasite load of an untreated survivor control dog 638.05 parasites felt outside the ic95% of that of vaccinated dogs 32.02 ic95% 9.45-64.59 suggesting that both vaccination treatments succeeded in reducing the leishmania infective burden accordingly an untreated control dog showed lower levels of ifn - il-2 il4 but not il-10 actin-relative quantification we conclude that the vr1012-nh36 vaccine induces strong prophylactic protection and a milder immunotherapeutic effect against a high dose canine experimental infection with leishmania chagasi
. diseases associated with spontaneous feline leukemia virus felv infection in cats vet immunol immunopathol more than 2000 cats sent for necropsy in order to provide a diagnosis were investigated immunohistologically using paraffin sections for the presence of a persistent infection with feline leukemia virus felv the spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with felv infection was determined statistically three-quarters of the cats with persistent felv infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex a strong association with liver degeneration icterus and a felv-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of felv hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis surprisingly diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia enteritis of other types than felv-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia glomerulonephritis uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent felv infection another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not felv-associated either thus immunosuppression due to felv infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents but not to the majority
here we report the immunogenicity of a sublingually delivered trivalent human papillomavirus hpv dna vaccine encapsidated in a human endogenous retrovirus herv envelopecoated nonreplicable baculovirus nanovector the herv envelope-coated nonreplicable baculovirus-based dna vaccine encoding hpv16l1 -18l1 and -58l1 acherv-trihpv was constructed and sublingually administered to mice without adjuvant following sublingual sl administration acherv-trihpv was absorbed and distributed throughout the body at 15 minutes and 1 day post-dose the distribution of acherv-trihpv to the lung was higher than that to other tissues at 30 days post-dose the levels of acherv-trihpv had diminished throughout the body six weeks after the first of three doses 1×10 8 copies of sl acherv-trihpv induced hpv type-specific serum igg and neutralizing antibodies to a degree comparable to that of im immunization with 1×10 9 copies acherv-trihpv induced hpv type-specific vaginal iga titers in a dose-dependent manner sl immunization with 1×10 10 copies of acherv-trihpv induced th1 and th2 cellular responses comparable to im immunization with 1×10 9 copies molecular imaging revealed that sl acherv-trihpv in mice provided complete protection against vaginal challenge with hpv16 hpv18 and hpv58 pseudoviruses these results support the potential of sl immunization using multivalent dna vaccine in baculovirus nanovector for induction of mucosal systemic and cellular immune responses

bats are the second most diverse mammalian group playing keystone roles in ecosystems but also act as reservoir hosts for numerous pathogens due to their colonial habits which implies close contacts between individuals bats are often parasitized by multiple species of micro-and macroparasites the particular ecology behavior and environment of bat species may shape patterns of intra-and interspecific pathogen transmission as well as the presence of specific vectorial organisms this review synthetizes information on a multi-level parasitic system bats bat flies and their microparasites bat flies diptera nycteribiidae and streblidae are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites of bats consisting of ∼500 described species diverse parasitic organisms have been detected in bat flies including bacteria blood parasites fungi and viruses which suggest their vectorial potential we discuss the ecological epidemiology of microparasites their potential physiological effects on both bats and bat flies and potential research perspectives in the domain of bat pathogens for simplicity we use the term microparasite throughout this review yet it remains unclear whether some bacteria are parasites or symbionts of their bat fly hosts
the current classification of animal viruses is largely based on the virus molecular world less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the success of virus transmission virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission dynamics and with it the organ system involvement and other macroscopic dimensions of the host environment this study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses 36 in total a mix of rna dna and retroviruses following an iterative process the viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion by organ system on ecological grounds also portrayed are the shifts in virus host tropism and virus genome the synthesis of the findings reveals a predictive virus evolution framework based on the outer-to inner-body changes in the interplay of host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome outer-body viruses opportunistically respond to the variation in the external environment for example respiratory and enteric viruses tend to be associated with poultry and pig mass rearing ruminant and equine viruses tend to be more deep-rooted and host-specific and also establish themselves in the vital inner-body systems it is concluded that the framework may assist the study of new emerging viruses and pandemic risks
influenza vaccines are usually non-adjuvanted but addition of adjuvant may improve immunogenicity and permit dose-sparing critical for vaccine supply in the event of an influenza pandemic the aim of this first-in-man study was to determine the effect of delta inulin adjuvant on the safety and immunogenicity of a reduced dose seasonal influenza vaccine healthy male and female adults aged 18-65 years were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled study to compare the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a reduced-dose 2007 southern hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with advax™ delta inulin adjuvant ltiv + adj when compared to a full-dose of the standard tiv vaccine which does not contain an adjuvant ltiv + adj provided equivalent immunogenicity to standard tiv vaccine as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition hi assays against each vaccine strain as well as against a number of heterosubtypic strains hi responses were sustained at 3 months post-immunisation in both groups antibody landscapes against a large panel of h3n2 influenza viruses showed distinct age effects whereby subjects over 40 years old had a bimodal baseline hi distribution pattern with the highest hi titers against the very oldest h3n2 isolates and with a second hi peak against influenza
zika virus is an emergent pathogen that gained significant importance during the epidemic in south and central america as unusual and alarming complications of infection were recognized although initially considered a self-limited benign infection a panoply of neurologic complications were recognized including a guillain-barré-like syndrome and in-utero fetal infection causing microcephaly blindness and other congenital neurologic complications numerous zika virus vaccines were developed with nine different vaccines representing five different platforms entered into clinical trials one progressing to phase ii here we review the current landscape and challenges confronting zika virus vaccine development
humans create ecologically simplified landscapes that favour some wildlife species but not others here we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments or 'synanthropic' species are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases eids we do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature the evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the australasian south east asian and east asian regions we find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species a significant positive association with eids is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion global decline in biodiversity and a rise in eids of wildlife origin
there are currently four commercially available vaccines in australia to protect chickens against infectious bronchitis virus ibv predominantly ibv causes clinical signs associated with respiratory or kidney disease which subsequently cause an increase in mortality rate three of the current vaccines belong to the same subgroup subgroup 1 however the vics vaccine has been reported to cause an increased vaccinal reaction compared to the other subgroup 1 vaccines molecular anomalies detected in vics suggested the presence of two major subspecies vics-v and vics-del present in the commercial preparation of vics the most notable anomaly is the absence of a 40 bp sequence in the 3 utr of vics-del in this investigation the two subspecies were isolated and shown to grow independently and to similar titres in embryonated chicken eggs an in vivo investigation involved 5 groups of 20 chickens each and found that vics-del grew to a significantly lesser extent in the chicken tissues collected than did vics-v the group inoculated with an even ratio of the isolated subspecies scored the most severe clinical signs with the longest duration these results indicate the potential for a cooperative instead of an expected competitive relationship between vics-v and vics-del to infect a host which is reminiscent of rna viral quasi-species
conventionally the efficiency of an adjuvant is measured by the capacity to induce enhanced antibody serum titres and cell mediated immunity cm11 to a given antigen nowadays the capacity of an adjuvant is also measured by the quality as well as the magnitude of the induced immune response guided by the protective immune response required quality includes isotype and igg subclass responses t-helper cell responses characterized by the cytokine profile and cytotoxic t cells ctl in the early phase of immunization some adjuvants influence the antigen administration and uptake by a so-called depot effect exemplified by aluminium hydroxide gel and oil adjuvants which possibly is not as desired as alledged a modem depot is exerted by slow release formulations continuously releasing the antigen over a period of time or by pulses at intervals aiming at 'single injection' vaccine great efforts are made to formulate efficient delivery formulations targeting the antigens from the site of administration to draining lymph nodes or distant lymphatic tissue or to mucosal surfaces by parenteral or mucosal administrations nowadays non-replicating carriers besides replicating vaccines are formulated to induce mucosal immune responses encompassing secretory iga and cmi efforts to evoke immune responses on mucosal membranes distant from the site of administration have resulted mostly in little success for a long time it was considered that ctl under the restriction of mhc class i only could be evoked by replicating viruses or intracellular parasites however novel adjuvant delivery systems readily induce ctl by delivering the antigen to the af'c resulting in intracellular transport to the cytosol for the mhc class i presentation system as well as to the endosomal pathway for the mhc class ii presentation
the human zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 hzp3 by virtue of its critical role during fertilization has been proposed as a promising candidate antigen to develop a contraceptive vaccine in this direction it is imperative to map minimal motifs of the b cell epitopes bces so as to avoid zp-specific oophoritogenic t cell epitopes tces in the zp3-based immunogens in this study based on known results of mapping marmoset and bonnet monkey zp3 mstzp3 and bmzp3 two predictable epitopes 23-30 and 301-320 on hzp3 were first confirmed and five minimal motifs within four epitopes on hzp3 were defined using serum to recombinant hzp3a 22-176 or hzp3b 177-348 as well as a biosynthetic peptide strategy these defined minimal motifs were qplwll 23-28 for hzp3 23-30 mqvtdd 103-108 for hzp3 93-110 eenw 178-181 for hzp3 as well as snswf 306-310 and egp 313-315 for hzp3 301-320 respectively furthermore the antigenicity of two peptides for hzp3 172-187 and hzp3 301-315 and specificity of the antibody response to these peptides were also evaluated which produced high-titer antibodies in immunized animals that were capable of reacting to zp on human oocytes r-hzp3b 177-348 protein as well as r-hzp3 and r-hzp3 313-320 epitope peptides fused with truncated gst188 protein
since sars-cov-2 became a pandemic event in the world it has not only caused huge economic losses but also a serious threat to global public health many scientific questions about sars-cov-2 and covid-19 were raised and urgently need to be answered including the susceptibility of animals to sars-cov-2 infection here we tested whether tree shrew an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal is susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection no clinical signs were observed in sars-cov-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature above 39 particular in female animals during infection low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups each of which showed his own characteristics histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues in summary tree shrew is not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for covid-19 related researches
two cardinal manifestations of viral immunity are efficient clearance of acute infection and the capacity to vaccinate against secondary viral exposure for noroviruses the contributions of t cells to viral clearance and vaccination have not been elucidated we report here that both cd4 and cd8 t cells are required for efficient clearance of primary murine norovirus mnv infection from the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes further long-lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination systemic vaccination with the mnv capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human lordsdale virus provided partial protection fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and b cells but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes perforin but not interferon gamma was required for clearance of mnv infection by adoptively transferred t lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts these studies prove the feasibility of both mucosal and systemic vaccination against mucosal norovirus infection demonstrate tissue specificity of norovirus immune cells and indicate that efficient vaccination strategies should induce potent cd4 and cd8 t cell responses

a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa was developed to detect and measure antibody to bovine herpesvirus type 1 bhv-1 in cattle sera the optical density produced from a single dilution of test serum was compared with a standard curve and the results were read and printed out from a computer interfaced to a multichannel elisa reader the printed results were expressed in elisa units the elisa results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test snt an agreement of 90.5% was obtained when reciprocal snt titres equal to or greater than 4 and igg elisa units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction of the 370 sera 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were snt positive/lgg elisa negative and 14 were snt negative/lgg elisa positive when the snt positive sera negative in the igg elisa were tested in an igm elisa 19 were found to be positive thus when the igg and igm elisa results were combined the overall agreement between the elisa and snt increased to 957%. the igg elisa had a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 94.4% relative to the snt whereas the combined igg and igm elisa results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 94.4% respectively there was a good positive correlation between the two tests r = 0.86
the bovine enteric calici-like virus newbury agent 1 na1 was characterised to determine if it is a member of the caliciviridae and to establish its antigenic relationship to the established bovine enteric calicivirus newbury agent 2 na2 solid phase immune electron microscopy spiem allowed quantification of na1 virions and identification of faecal samples with optimal virus levels na1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses srsvs and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml 31 . a single capsid protein of 49.4 kda was detected by western blotting in purified na1 preparations prepared from post-infection but not pre-infection faecal samples and with post-but not pre-infection sera na1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus na2 by spiem these properties were consistent with classification of na1 within the caliciviridae but demonstrated heterogeneity in the capsid composition of bovine enteric caliciviruses ß
since 1997 g1-lineage h9n2 avian influenza viruses have been circulating in asia and later on in the middle east and they have been associated to mild respiratory disease drops in egg production and moderate mortality in chickens in particular in the presence of concurrent infections in this study we investigated the importance of the g1-lineage h9n2 a/chicken/israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues and investigating the long-term impact on egg production besides causing a mild respiratory infection the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ in particular at the level of the infundibulum where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate and necrosis of the epithelium binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct the drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection pi 60% decrease and continued up to 80 days pi 35% decrease on day 80 pi non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal our results show that this h9n2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct compromising the commercial life of birds
a decline in immune function is a hallmark of aging that leads to complicated illness from a variety of infectious diseases cancer and other immune-mediated disorders and may limit the ability to appropriately respond to vaccination how vaccines might alter the senescent immune response and what are the immune correlates of protection will be addressed from the perspective of 1 stimulating a previously primed response as in the case of vaccines for seasonal influenza and herpes zoster 2 priming the response to novel antigens such as pandemic influenza or other viruses 3 vaccination against bacterial pathogens such as pneumococcus and 4 altering the immune response to an endogenous protein as in the case of a vaccine against alzheimer's disease in spite of the often limited efficacy of vaccines for older adults influenza vaccination remains the only cost-saving medical intervention in this population thus considerable opportunity exists to improve current vaccines and develop new vaccines as a preventive approach to a variety of diseases in older adults strategies for selecting appropriate immunologic targets for new vaccine development and evaluating how vaccines may alter the senescent immune response
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndromeprrs caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virusprrsv is one of the most infectious diseases in the swine industry worldwide causing big economic losses vaccines are major weapons against prrsv however current available vaccines have several limitations developing chemical drugs as alternatives is required on the basis of traditional medical knowledge we purposely selected 15 natural products originated from chinese herbs with anti-infectious effects their antiviral activities were evaluated by prrsv-induced cytopathic effectcpe on marc-145 cells and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionrt-pcr assay compounds ethoxysanguinarineeosg and atractylodinol were found to be the hits which could significantly reduce prrsv-associated cpe with 50% inhibited concentrationic 50 values of 7.9 and 39.4 μmol/l respectively meanwhile compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol significantly decreased mrna expression of orf7 gene in a dose-dependent manner study results suggest that compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol may be useful anti-prrsv drugs for swine industry or the hits for further lead optimization
typical enteropathogenic e coli tepec carries the highest hazard of death in children with diarrhea and atypical epec aepec was recently identified as significantly associated with diarrheal mortality in kittens in both children and kittens there is a significant association between aepec burden and diarrheal disease however the infection can be found in individuals with and without diarrhea it remains unclear to what extent under what conditions or by what mechanisms aepec serves as a primary pathogen in individuals with diarrhea it seems likely that a combination of host and bacterial factors enable aepec to cause disease in some individuals and not in others the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of aepec on intestinal function and diarrhea in kittens following experimentally-induced carriage and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility results of this study identify aepec as a potential pathogen in kittens in the absence of disruption to the intestinal microbiota kittens are resistant to clinical signs of aepec carriage but demonstrate significant occult changes in intestinal absorption and permeability antibiotic-induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota prior to infection increases subsequent intestinal water loss as determined by % fecal wet weight enrichment of the intestinal microbiota with a commensal member of the feline mucosa-associated microbiota enterococcus hirae ameliorated the effects of aepec experimental infection on intestinal function and water loss these observations begin to unravel the mechanisms by which aepec infection may be able to exploit susceptible hosts
the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv has three major structural proteins which designated as gp5 m and n protein gp5 and m have been considered very important to arouse the humoral and cellular immune responses against prrsv infection and proposed to be the excellent candidate proteins in the design of prrs bioengineering vaccine there were some attempts on expressing gp5 or m in dna vaccine and adenovirus to arouse humoral and cellular immune responses but few papers have been reported on that the immune response can be difference because of the expression patterns of gp5 and m proteins in the recombinant virus in this article four recombinant viruses that expressed gp5 and m proteins of prrsv in the modified vaccinia virus ankara mva with different expression patterns were made in these recombinant virus rmvas gp5 and m proteins were expressed in mva in the same virus but under the control of two promoters rmva-gp5/ m or as a fusion protein under one promoter rmva-gp5-m or separately rmva-gp5 and rmva-m the humoral and cellular immune responses for the four recombinant viruses were evaluated with mouse model every mouse was inoculated with 5 · 10 5 tcid 50 of the different rmvas and boosted 3 weeks later neutralizing antibody titers for each group were detected with virus neutralization test assay weekly after the primary inoculation for 13 weeks to evaluate the humoral immune response the production of gamma interferon ifn-c interleukin-2 il-2 and interleukin-4 il-4 was detected in splenocytes of rmva-inoculated mice at 30 60 and 90 days post inoculation to evaluate the cellular immune response results showed that rmva-gp5 and rmva-m cannot induce obvious humoral and cellular immune responses rmva-gp5-m inoculated group developed better immune responses than rmva-gp5 and rmva-m inoculated groups however mice inoculated with rmva-gp5/m maintained the strongest cellular response against prrs and consistently enhanced the anti-prrsv humoral responses the strategy of co-expressing prrsv gp5 and m protein in mva under the control of different promoters might be an attractive method for future prrsv vaccine design
background serological testing for sars-cov-2 igg antibodies is needed to document the community prevalence and distribution of the virus particularly since many individuals have mild symptoms and cannot access molecular diagnostic testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs however the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood to address this problem we developed a serological test for sars-cov-2 igg antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper dried blood spot dbs methods enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa was optimized to detect sars-cov-2 igg antibodies against the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike protein dbs samples were eluted overnight and transferred to a 96-well plate coated with antigen and anti-human igg-hrp was used to generate signal in proportion to bound antibody dbs samples spiked with anti-sars igg antibody and samples from known positive and negative cases were compared to evaluate assay performance analysis of samples with known concentrations of anti-sars igg produced the expected pattern of dose-response optical density od values were significantly elevated for known positive cases in comparison with samples from unexposed individuals discussion dbs elisa provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection that combines the convenience of sample collection in the home or non-clinical setting with the quantitation of elisa in the lab serological testing for sars-cov-2 igg antibodies in dbs samples should facilitate research across a wide range of community-and population-based settings on seroprevalence predictors and duration of antibody responses as well as correlates of protection from reinfection each of which is critically important for pandemic control
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first discovered in late 2012 and has gone on to cause over 1800 infections and 650 deaths there are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccinations for mers-cov the mers-cov spike s protein is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells is immunodominant and induces neutralizing antibodies in vivo all of which make the s protein an ideal target for anti-mers-cov vaccines in this study we demonstrate protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine and matrix-m1 adjuvant combination in mice the mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine produced high titer anti-s neutralizing antibody and protected mice from mers-cov infection in vivo
the recently emerged highly virulent variants of porcine epidemic and diarrhea virus pedv remain a huge threat to the worldwide swine industry here we describe the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome bac reverse genetics system for pedv based on two recent chinese field isolates namely chm2013 and bj2011c phylogenetically chm2013 is closely related to the vaccine strain sm98 whereas the isolate bj2011c belongs to the giib group a cluster that contains many recent pandemic strains the fulllength cdna clones of the two isolates were constructed into bac under the control of cmv promoter the rescued viruses rbj2011c and rchm2013 were found to replicate at the kinetics similar to their respective parental viruses in cell culture when tested in the 2-dayold pig model rbj2011c caused severe diarrhea of piglets with extensive damages to the intestinal epithelium leading to 100% fatality within 48 hours in contrast the rchm2013inoculated piglets all survived with only very minor tissue damage observed thus we have successfully established a convenient platform for pedv genome manipulation this study also represents the first description of a dna-launched reverse genetics system for the highly virulent pedv open access citation li j jin z gao y zhou l ge x guo x et al 2017 development of the full-length cdna clones of two porcine epidemic diarrhea disease virus isolates with different virulence plos one 12 3 e0173998 https//doi org/10
in the absence of approved drugs or vaccines there is a pressing need to develop tools for therapy 31 and prevention of covid-19 human monoclonal antibodies have very good probability of being 32 safe and effective tools for therapy and prevention of sars-cov-2 infection and disease here we 33 describe the screening of pbmcs from seven people who survived covid-19 infection to isolate 34 human monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov-2 over 1100 memory b cells were single-cell 35 sorted using the stabilized prefusion form of the spike protein and incubated for two weeks to allow 36 natural production of antibodies supernatants from each cell were tested by elisa for spike 37 protein binding and positive antibodies were further tested for neutralization of spike binding to 38 receptors on vero e6 cells and for virus neutralization in vitro from the 1167 memory b specific 39 for sars-cov-2 we recovered 318 b lymphocytes expressing human monoclonals recognizing the 40 spike protein and 74 of these were able to inhibit the binding of the spike protein to the receptor 41 finally 17 mabs were able to neutralize the virus when assessed for neutralization in vitro lead 42 candidates to progress into the drug development pipeline will be selected from the panel of 43 neutralizing antibodies identified with the procedure described in this study.44 45 3
the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus chikv has become a major global health problem upon infection chikungunya fever chikf can result in long-term joint pain and arthritis and despite intense research no licensed vaccine for chikv is available we have developed two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines chadox1 that induce swift and robust anti-chikv immune responses with a single dose without the need for adjuvants or booster vaccines here we report the vaccines' protective efficacies against chikv infection in a lethal a129 mouse model our results indicate that a single un-adjuvanted chadox1 chik or chadox1 chik ∆cap dose provided complete protection against a lethal virus challenge and prevented chikv-associated severe inflammation these candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 chikv reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects such as weight loss vaccination with either chadox1 chik or chadox1 chik ∆cap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested we conclude that both replication-deficient chadox1 chik vaccines are safe even when used in a129 mice and afford complete protection from a lethal challenge
we noticed that countries which applied a universal bcg vaccination policy before 1960 are better protected against sars-cov-2 infection even if immunization ceased a few decades later on the other hand countries which applied a late vaccination policy after 1960 and continue immunization are better protected than those that have stopped it
a b s t r a c t bats are highly diverse and ecologically important mammals they harbor various bacteria viruses and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited particularly for the gut and to date there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of rhinolophus monoceros from meghalaya india there are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches therefore highthroughput screening was used to understand the population structure genetic diversity and ecological role of the microorganisms high-throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by proteobacteria followed by firmicutes the bacterial genera corynebacterium and mycobacterium were also observed in the illumina dataset illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera the metagenomic analysis of the otus from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens there were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study which could be related to host specificity diet and habitat the culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates of which bacillus cereus and b anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates and different antibiotics were used for gram-positive and -negative bacteria the result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin g and cefoxitin this report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics enzymes plant growth promoters and probiotics however the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further
since late 2010 outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped have been reported in the swine industry in china a variant pedv strain that differs from strain cv777 causes prevalent pedv infections which commercial vaccines based on cv777 cannot provide complete protection in this study we designed a new vaccine based on the epidemic pedv strain ah2012/12 adjuvanted with flagellin a mucosal adjuvant that induces mucosal and systemic production of iga three groups of pregnant sows were immunized twice with a 14-day interval with pedv adjuvanted with flagellin pedv alone or pbs before farrowing and newborn piglets from each group were selected and challenged with pedv immunization with this vaccine elicited high levels of igg iga and neutralizing antibodies in the serum and colostrum of sows and newborn piglets were protected against pedv while suckling this study should guide the prevention and control strategies for pedv infection thereby reducing the losses associated with this virus publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
humans live increasingly in the proximity of natural areas leading to increased interactions between people their livestock and wildlife we explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission foot-and-mouth disease between cattle and the african buffalo the maintenance host and how a top predator the lion may modulate these interactions the interface of hwange national park hnp and surrounding communal lands zimbabwe we combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for fmd gps-collar data and cattle owners' interviews during four seasons in 2010-2011 overall fmd incidence in cattle was low but showed a peak during the rainy season the incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area i e buffer zone of 3 km inside hnp and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle these results suggest that fmd virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species the analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that 1 buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that 2 lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions lions could thus reduce the spatio-temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface which could contribute to the low level of fmd incidence during the rainy season traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the hnp but not during the dry season suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the hnp this study highlights the complex dynamics that operates at human/livestock/wildlife interfaces africa herding practices human-wildlife coexistence interspecific contacts networks space use | 1019 miguel et al
labile toxin producing enterotoxic e coli etec were the commonest pathogen isolated from diarrheal stools of hospitalized children 21% and adults 26% in singapore salmonellas ranked a close second in children 19%. other bacterial pathogens were isolated from less than 5% of subjects blastocystis hominis was detected in 4.3% of diarrheal stools when a simple sedimentation technique was used cryptosporidium was not detected at all an analysis of yeast counts in smears of diarrheal and nondiarrheal stools suggested they were etiologically associated with at least 6% of diarrhea in children and 19% in adults testing for rotaviruses by latex agglutination and for adenovirus by electronmicroscopy showed an association with 6 per cent and 3 per cent diarrhea respectively the study highlighted a need for case control studies on etec and b hominis studies on the epidemiology of diarrhea by yeasts establishing the true incidence of adenovirus diarrhea studies on the prevalence and seasonality of rotavirus infection in singapore
the antiquated system used to manufacture the currently licensed inactivated influenza virus vaccines would not be adequate during an influenza virus pandemic there is currently a search for vaccines that can be developed faster and provide superior long-lasting immunity to influenza virus as well as other highly pathogenic viruses and bacteria recombinant vectors provide a safe and effective method to elicit a strong immune response to a foreign protein or epitope this review explores the advantages and limitations of several different vectors that are currently being tested and highlights some of the newer viruses being used as recombinant vectors
coronaviruses are widespread in the environment infecting humans domesticated and wild mammals and birds infections cause a variety of diseases including bronchitis gastroenteritis hepatitis and encephalitis with symptoms ranging from being nearly undetectable to rapidly fatal a combination of interacting variables determine the pattern and severity of coronavirus-induced disease including the infecting virus strain its transmission strategy and the age and immune status of the infected host coronavirus pathogenesis is best understood by discerning how each of these variables dictates clinical outcomes this chapter focuses on variabilities amongst the spike s proteins of infecting virus strains diversity of coronavirus surface proteins likely contributes to epidemic disease an important and timely topic given the recent emergence of the human sars coronavirus
a novel avian influenza a h7n9 virus recently emerged in the yangtze river delta and caused diseases often severe in over 130 people this h7n9 virus appeared to infect humans with greater ease than previous avian infl uenza virus subtypes such as h5n1 and h9n2 while there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus we investigated whether a lack of conserved t-cell epitopes between endemic h1n1 and h3n2 infl uenza viruses and the novel h7n9 virus contributes to this observation here we demonstrate that a number of t cell epitopes are conserved between endemic h1n1 and h3n2 viruses and h7n9 virus most of these conserved epitopes are from viral internal proteins the extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal infl uenza and avian infl uenza h7n9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza h5n1 thus the ease of inter-species transmission of h7n9 viruses compared with avian h5n1 viruses cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such t cell epitopes on the contrary our fi ndings predict signifi cant t-cell based cross-reactions in the human population to the novel h7n9 virus our findings also have implications for h7n9 virus vaccine design
further attenuated measles vaccines were developed more than 50 years ago and have been used throughout the world recombinant measles vaccine candidates have been developed and express several heterologous virus protective antigens immunogenicity and protective actions were confirmed using experimental animals transgenic mice cotton rats and primates the recent development of measles vaccine-based vectored vaccine candidates has been reviewed and some information on recombinant measles vaccines expressing respiratory syncytial virus proteins has been shown and discussed

severe immunosuppression is a hallmark of morbillivirus infections to study the underlying mechanisms we have developed a ferret model of canine distemper virus infection the model reproduces all clinical signs of measles but the lack of ferret-specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response towards this we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi-quantitative real-time pcr assays to demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non-lethal strains during the prodromal phase we observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response the newly developed cytokine assays strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for morbillivirus pathogenesis studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and sars
despite environmental social and ecological dependencies emergence of zoonotic viruses in human populations is clearly also affected by genetic factors which determine cross-species transmission potential rna viruses pose an interesting case study given their mutation rates are orders of magnitude higher than any other pathogen -as reflected by the recent emergence of sars and influenza for example here we show how feature selection techniques can be used to reliably classify viral sequences by host species and to identify the crucial minority of host-specific sites in pathogen genomic data the variability in alleles at those sites can be translated into prediction probabilities that a particular pathogen isolate is adapted to a given host we illustrate the power of these methods by 1 identifying the sites explaining sars coronavirus differences between human bat and palm civet samples 2 showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified and 3 de novo identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers
some characteristics of a virus isolated from the tonsils of 2 pigs with clinical signs of inappetenee and vomition and designated vw572 were examined it induced the formation of syneytia in primary pig kidney cell cultures caused hemadsorption and hemagglutination using chicken turkey rat and mouse erythrocytes in growth curve experiments infectious virus was produced intracellularly starting at 6 hours after inoculation and was followed by rapid release of the virus from the infected cells the virus contains ribonucleic acid is ether sensitive and has a size between 100 and 220 nm at 37 ~ c the infectivity titer decreased about 2 logl0tcids0 per 24 hours the viral population was heterogeneous as indicated by the rate of inactivation by u v irradiation and acid ph some hemagglutinating activity was left after complete loss of infectivity by ether- temperature-and u v treatment the vw 572 isolate is antigenically related if not identical to isolates from canada u s a and england which were classified as a porcine eoronavirus oronasal and intracerebral inoculation of the vw572 isolate in colostrum deprived pigs resulted in clinical disease after an incubation period of 6 and 4 days respectively signs were characterized by depression vomition loss of appetence with rapid weakness in young pigs and vomition with progressive wasting in older pigs virus was isolated from nasal and pharyngeal swabs nasal mueosa tonsils lungs and hind brains but not from rectal swabs or other organs tested virus could not be isolated later than 8 days after inoculation hemagglutination inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera at 6 days and 9 days after inoculation respectively
background antibodies to microbes or to autoantigens are important markers of disease antibody detection serology can reveal both past and recent infections there is a great need for development of rational ways of detecting and quantifying antibodies both for humans and animals traditionally serology using synthetic antigens covers linear epitopes using up to 30 amino acid peptides methods we here report that peptides of 100 amino acids or longer "megapeptides" designed and synthesized for optimal serological performance can successfully be used as detection antigens in a suspension multiplex immunoassay smia megapeptides can quickly be created just from pathogen sequences a combination of rational sequencing and bioinformatic routines for definition of diagnostically-relevant antigens can thus rapidly yield efficient serological diagnostic tools for an emerging infectious pathogen results we designed megapeptides using bioinformatics and viral genome sequences these long peptides were tested as antigens for the presence of antibodies in human serum to the filo- herpes- and polyoma virus families in a multiplex microarray system all of these virus families contain recently discovered or emerging infectious viruses conclusion long synthetic peptides can be useful as serological diagnostic antigens serving as biomarkers in suspension microarrays
the aims of the present work were to determine the prevalence and titer of serum antibodies against several rotavirus vp8* proteins from different p genotypes in children and adults in valencia spain and to determine the role of the secretor status fut2 g428a polymorphism in the antibody response coli these proteins were tested with 88 serum samples from children n = 41 3.5 years old in average and from adults n = 47 58 years old in average by elisa a subset of 55 samples were genotyped for the fut2 g428a polymorphism and the antibody titers compared the same subset of samples was also analysed by elisa using whole rotavirus wa particles g1p as antigen ninety-three per cent of the samples were positive for at least one of the vp8* antigens differences in the igg seroprevalence were found between children and adults for the p p and p genotypes similarly significant differences were found between adults and children in their antibody titers against the p p and p vp8* genotypes having the children higher antibody titers than adults interestingly positive samples against rare genotypes such as p only in children p and p were found while no statistical differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found for any of the tested p genotypes studied a higher statistic significant prevalence for the p genotype was found in secretors compared to non-secretors significant differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found when the whole viral particles from the wa rotavirus strain g1p were used as the antigen rotaviruses are the leading etiologic agent of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide 1 . rotavirus contains segmented double stranded rna genome the rotavirus protein vp7 makes up the outer capsid protein shell and vp4 forms the spikes that emanate through the outer capsid vp7 is a glycoprotein that determines the g-type antigen while vp4 is a protease-sensitive protein that determines the p-type antigen 2 . the common rotavirus classification involves their genome composition and their serological reactivity so the scientific community uses the vp7 vp4 and vp6 proteins to classify them rotaviruses are classified into 7 groups a to g based in the immunological reactivity of the vp6 middle layer viral protein rotaviruses from the groups a to c have been isolated from humans but the most prevalent is the group a the two outer capsid protein vp7 and vp4 are used to classify rotavirus in g and p types genotypes and/or serotypes nowadays we can count more than 36 different g-genotypes and 51 p-genotypes https//rega kuleuven be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/rcwg the most prevalent genotypes in humans infections are g1p g2p g3p and g4p . more recently a classification using the eleven segments of the genome has been settled up this new classification allows a more in deep knowledge of rotavirus epidemiology to better study the occurrence of genetic reassortants 3 .
aging-related decline in immunity is believed to be the main driver behind decreased vaccine efficacy and reduced resistance to infections in older adults unrepaired dna damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age-related phenotypes consistent with this some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole-body irradiation wbi which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells to decisively test whether and to what extent wbi in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages we exposed young male c57bl/6 mice to sublethal wbi 0.5-4 gy mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe we followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan response to vaccination and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age none of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock-irradiated 0 gy animals for the parameters measured even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal wbi in youth 4 gy exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis robust t-and b-cell responses to live attenuated west nile virus wnv vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal wnv challenge therefore a single dose of nonlethal wbi in youth resulting in widespread dna damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model
anti-coronaviral activity of a mixture of oleoresins and essential oils from botanicals designated qr448a was examined in vitro and in vivo treatment of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv with qr448a reduced the virus titer as measured in two laboratory host systems vero e6 cells and embryonating eggs the effect of qr448a on ibv in chickens was also investigated administering qr448a to chickens at a 120 dilution by spray 2 h before challenge with ibv was determined to be the most effective treatment treatment decreased the severity of clinical signs and lesions in the birds and lowered the amount of viral rna in the trachea treatment with qr448a protected chickens for up to 4 days posttreatment from clinical signs of disease but not from infection and decreased transmission of ibv over a 14-day period anti-ibv activity of qr448a was greater prior to virus attachment and entry indicating that the effect is virucidal in addition qr448a had activity against both massachusetts and arkansas type ib viruses indicating that it can be expected to be effective against ibv regardless of serotype to our knowledge this is the first report on the in vivo use of a virucidal mixture of compounds effective against the coronavirus ibv
eight cats were immunized with an avirulent strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv-ucd1 then challenge-exposed to a highly virulent cat passaged strain fipv-ucd8 th1 and th2 cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs were measured throughout in the experiment no clinical signs of fip were evident in the experimental cats after immunization after challenge the immunized cats demonstrated one of four clinical outcomes 1 classical effusive fip 2 accelerated fip 3 non-effusive fip or 4 resistance to challenge only minor cytokine changes were observed following immunization however several cytokine changes occurred following challenge-exposure the most noteworthy changes were in tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- and interferon gamma ifn- levels our preliminary findings suggest that immunity against fip is associated with tnf-and ifn-response imbalance with high tnf-/low ifn-mrna responses favouring disease and low tnf-/high ifn-mrna responses being indicative of immunity

alpacas vicugna pacos a species of south american camelids sac suffer high morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases diarrhea is one of the leading causes of alpaca cria mortality in peru and elsewhere in order to develop appropriate control and/or treatment it is necessary to identify infectious pathogens that cause diarrhea in crias rotavirus was isolated in cell culture from feces collected from crias with acute diarrhea that tested positive to rotaviral antigen by rapid immunochromatographic methods in an earlier study the isolates were identified as rotaviruses by rt-pcr run with specific primers for human rotavirus vp7 coding sequences using total rna extracted from cells displaying cytopathic effects as template these alpaca isolates were further identified as group a rotaviruses by means of a vp6-specific pcr and were designated as alrva-k'ayra/perú/3368-10 and alrva-k'ayra/ perú/3386-10 molecular g and p typing placed the former as g3/p11 and the latter as g3/p sequence analysis of two genome segments coding for vp4 and vp7 from the alpaca isolates revealed partial homologies to swine and human rotaviruses respectively these results demonstrate that rotaviruses are associated with a proportion of cases of diarrhea in crias although prevalence and impact remain to be determined the isolation of rotaviruses from alpaca crias with diarrhea will contribute positively to further understand the pathogen and its role in the diarrhea complex
previously we demonstrated that a genetically engineered variant of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv serotype al2 lacking the leader proteinase-coding region a12-llv2 was attenuated and induced an immune response that partially protected cattle ffom fmd in this study az2-llv2 was tested in swine as a live or chemically inactivated vaccine animals vaccinated with chemically inactivated a12-llv2 or wild-type wt virus in oil adjuvant developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies and were protected from fmd upon challenge animals vaccinated with live a12-llv2 did not exhibit signs of fmd did not spread virus to other animals developed a neutralizing antibody response and antibodies to nonstructural protein 30 and were partially protected from fmd animals given a similar dose of chemically inactivated a12-llv2 in the absence of adjuvant developed a poor immune response and were not protected from fmd indicating that limited replication was responsible for the improved immune response found in animals vaccinated with live a12-llv2 the results demonstrate the potential of a12-llv2 as a live-attenuated vaccine as well as a safe source of antigen for chemically inactivated vaccines 0 1998 elsevier science ltd all rights reserved
avian infl uenza virus h5n1 can be transmitted to humans resulting in a severe or fatal disease the aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian infl uenza h5n1 strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal infl uenza a h1n1/h3n2 a small frequency of cd4 t cells specifi c for subtype h5n1 was detected in several persons at baseline and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive cd4 t cells we also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against infl uenza h5n1 in a large number of donors no correlation between infl uenzaspecifi c cd4 t cells and humoral responses was observed n1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point these fi ndings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza a virus subtype h5n1 by seasonal infl uenza vaccination
jhm virus when inoculated into neonatal rats can cause either a rapidly fatal acute encephalomyelitis or after longer incubation periods a paralytic disease the cerebrospinal fluid csf and serum anti-jhm virus igg concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared high csf/serum ratios indicative of local antibody production in the cns were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest only those with elevated csf/serum ratios were found to have histological cns lesions immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal cns tissue while regions of necrosis were antigen negative testing for the presence of viral rna with jhm cdna probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the cns presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage viral rna was also detected in the cns following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection where no disease occurred these findings indicate that although infection by jhm virus can spread rapidly throughout the cns formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process the current data and previous observations suggest that jhm virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses
orange js du w and falsey ar 2015 therapeutic immunoglobulin selected for high antibody titer to rsv also contains high antibody titers to other respiratory viruses specific antibodies against infections most relevant to patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases are not routinely evaluated in commercial polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations a polyclonal immunoglobulin prepared from plasma of donors having high neutralizing antibody titers to respiratory syncytial virus rsv was studied for the presence of antibody titers against seven additional respiratory viruses while donors were not selected for antibody titers other than against rsv the immunoglobulin preparation had significantly higher titers to 6 of 7 viruses compared to those present in 10 commercially available therapeutic immunoglobulin products p ≤ 0.01 to p ≤ 0.001 to consider this as a donor-specific attribute 20 random donor plasma samples were studied individually and identified a significant correlation between the rsv antibody titer and other respiratory virus titers donors with high rsv titers were more likely to have higher titers to other respiratory viruses these findings suggest either some humoral antiviral response bias or more frequent viral exposure of certain individuals
the failure of traditional tissue culture methods to recover viruses from a high proportion of adults and children with respiratory disease led to the testing of new diploid cell strains1j2 and to the application of organ culture techniques to virus r e c o~e r y .~*~ to a large extent these efforts made possible the isolation from the human respiratory tract of several virus strains that were of an unusual morphology when examined by negative staining and that have recently been grouped together under the name of "coronaviruses."6 on examination by electron microscopy the coronaviruses are medium-sized particles of moderate pleomorphism with widely spaced club-shaped surface proje~tions.4.~ the members of this group which includes avian infectious bronchitis virus many strains of mouse hepatitis virus mhv and several viruses of human origin are rnacontaining and chloroform-labile twenty-three coronavirus strains have been recovered from the human respiratory t r a~t .~~ * *~ of these 14 strains were isolated in tissue culture and appeared to be serologically similar or identical to the prototype strain 229e.'** the nine remaining strains were isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture two of these strains oc38 and oc43 were successfully adapted to growth in suckling mouse brain i0 these two strains were serologically indistinguishable and have been shown to bear a serologic relation to several strains of mhv by complement-fixation cf tests this communication outlines first recent epidemiologic studies of coronavirus infection and second attempts to adapt some of the more fastidious strains to growth in tissue culture monolayers preliminary epidemiologic observations of human coronavirus infection suggested that they might be sporadically associated with upper respiratory tract infection in adults we undertook to delineate in greater detail the seroepidemiology of coronavirus infection in adults with upper respiratory tract disease and in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract disease lrtd . the adults were employees of the national institutes of health with colds the children were patients with croup bronchitis bronchiolitis or pneumonia admitted to children's hospital washington d c the control pediatric group was made up of patients at the same hospital with nonrespiratory disease acute and convalescent serum samples were obtained at an interval of three weeks the virus isolation procedures employed were those previously reported.14
background there is a clear need for vaccines and therapeutics for potential biological weapons of mass destruction and emerging diseases anthrax caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection it does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to b anthracis exotoxin accumulation the bipartite exotoxins are the major contributing factors to the morbidity and mortality observed in acute anthrax infections methods using recombinant b anthracis protective antigen pa83 covalently coupled to a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide nt-mdp derivative we hyper-immunized goats three times over the course of 14 weeks goats were plasmapheresed and the igg fraction not affinity purified and fab' 2 derivatives were characterized in vitro and in vivo for protection against lethal toxin mediated intoxication results anti-pa83 igg conferred 100% protection at 7.5 μg in a cell toxin neutralization assay mice exposed to 5 ld 50 of bacillus anthracis ames spores by intranares inoculation demonstrated 60% survival 14 d post-infection when administered a single bolus dose 32 mg/kg body weight of anti-pa83 igg at 24 h post spore challenge anti-pa83 fab' 2 fragments retained similar neutralization and protection levels both in vitro and in vivo the protection afforded by these gmp-grade caprine immunotherapeutics postexposure in the pilot murine model suggests they could be used effectively to treat post-exposure symptomatic human anthrax patients following a bioterrorism event these results also indicate that recombinant pa83 coupled to nt-mdp is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies and suggest it would be a promising vaccine candidate for anthrax the ease of production ease of covalent attachment and immunostimulatory activity of the nt-mdp indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations
group a rotaviruses rva are regarded as major enteric pathogens of large ruminants including cattle rotavirus vaccines administered to pregnant cows are commonly used to provide passive immunity that protects newborn calves from the clinical disease in this study we report the detection of rva from calves with severe diarrhea in a herd regularly vaccinated to prevent enteric infections including rva diarrheic disease was observed in newborn calves aged 4-15 days with high morbidity and mortality rates but no diarrhea was seen in adult animals rotavirus antigen was detected by enzymeimmunoassay in the intestinal content or the fecal samples of all examined animals besides rva bovine coronavirus and bovine enteric calicivirus were detected in some samples selected rva strains were characterized by whole genome sequencing two strains rva/cow-wt/tur/amasya-1/2015/g8p and rva/cow-wt/tur/amasya-2/2015/g8p were genotyped as g8-p-i2-r2-c2-m2-a3-n2-t6-e2-h3 and showed >99% nucleotide sequence identity among themselves this genomic constellation is fairly common among bovine rva strains however phylogenetic analysis of the g8 vp7 gene showed close genetic relationship to some european human rva strains up to 98.4% nt identity our findings is the first indication regarding the circulation of g8 rva strains in turkey given that the administered rva vaccines contained type g6 and g10 vp7 antigens some concerns raised with regard to the level of heterotypic protection elicited by the vaccine strains against circulating bovine g8 rva strains enhancement of surveillance of circulating rva strains in calves across turkey is needed to support ongoing vaccination programs

drug combinations are synergistic when their combined efficacy exceeds the sum of the individual actions but they rarely include ineffective drugs that become effective only in combination we identified several ''enabling pairs'' of neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies whose combination exhibited new functional profiles including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2g4 or m8c4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody fvm09 ic 50 >1 mm to exhibit potent neutralization ic 50 1-10 nm while fvm09 or m8c4 alone failed to protect ebola-virusinfected mice a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection furthermore nonneutralizers fvm09 and fvm02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neu-tralizing antibodies against both ebola and sudan viruses we identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and gp2 enabling cooperativity maythis is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license http//creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/. be an underappreciated phenomenon for viruses with implications for the design and development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines in brief howell et al describe the phenomenon of "enabling cooperative neutralization" where weakly neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies exhibit potent neutralization when combined the previously identified antibodies m8c4 and fvm09 which are non-protective alone offer 100% protection against ebola and sudan virus challenge in mice when combined howell et al
an increasingly asked question is 'can we confidently link bats with emerging viruses '. no or not yet is the qualified answer based on the evidence available although more than 200 viruses -some of them deadly zoonotic viruses -have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats the supposed connections between bats bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases except for rabies however we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses in this review we cover aspects of bat biology ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats we provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment
the genus henipavirus in the family paramyxoviridae contains two viruses hendra virus hev and nipah virus niv for which pteropid bats act as the main natural reservoir each virus also causes serious and commonly lethal infection of people as well as various species of domestic animals however little is known about the associated mechanisms of pathogenesis here we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats cedar virus cedpv which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses the genome size 18162 nt and organization of cedpv is very similar to that of hev and niv its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses and it uses the same receptor molecule ephrin-b2 for entry during infection preliminary challenge studies with cedpv in ferrets and guinea pigs both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed in this context it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between cedpv and hev or niv lies within the coding strategy of the p gene which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system unlike hev niv and almost all known paramyxoviruses the cedpv p gene lacks both rna editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved v protein preliminary study indicated that cedpv infection of human cells induces a more robust ifn-b response than hev

background chikungunya virus chikv is a recently reemerged arbovirus responsible for a massive outbreak of infection in the indian ocean region and india that has a very significant potential to spread globally because of the worldwide distribution of its mosquito vectors chikv induces a usually self-limited disease in humans that is characterized by fever arthralgia myalgia and rash however cases of severe chikv infection have recently been described particularly in adults with underlying condition and neonates born to viremic mothers methods human polyvalent immunoglobulins were purified from plasma samples obtained from donors in the convalescent phase of chikv infection and the preventive and curative effects of these immunoglobulins were investigated in 2 mouse models of chikv infection that we developed results chikv immunoglobulins contain anti-chikv antibodies and exhibit a high in vitro neutralizing activity and a powerful prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against chikv infection in vivo including in the neonate conclusions administration of chikv immunoglobulins may constitute a safe and efficacious prevention strategy and treatment for individuals exposed to chikv who are at risk of severe infection such as neonates born to viremic mothers and adults with underlying conditions these results provide a proof-of-concept for purifying human immunoglobulins from plasma samples from patients in the convalescent phase of an emerging infectious disease for which neither prevention nor treatment is available chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease caused by chikungunya virus chikv a member of the togaviridae family and alphavirus genus chikv was first isolated in 1953 during an epidemic of polyarthralgia in tanzania . in 2005 chikv emerged in the indian ocean region and caused a massive outbreak of infection notably in la réunion island where more than one-third of the inhabitants were infected 246 of
most new emerging viruses are derived from strains circulating in zoonotic reservoirs coronaviruses which had an established potential for cross-species transmission within domesticated animals suddenly became relevant with the unexpected emergence of the highly pathogenic human sars-cov strain from zoonotic reservoirs in 2002 sars-cov infected approximately 8000 people worldwide before public health measures halted the epidemic supported by robust time-ordered sequence variation structural biology well-characterized patient pools and biological data the emergence of sars-cov represents one of the best studied natural models of viral disease emergence from zoonotic sources this review article summarizes previous and more recent advances into the molecular and structural characteristics with particular emphasis on host-receptor interactions that drove this remarkable virus disease outbreak in human populations
a method is described for in vitro studies of viral humoral immune responses in the pig after oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen for the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with uv-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells asc and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with elisaspot using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen and elisa tests respectively according to the ig isotype the results showed a close relationship between asc numbers and secreted antibody titres the best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak with a maximum occurring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the iga response appearing earlier than the igg this methodology which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level may permit studies on the mechanisms of ig isotype regulation extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig

bats are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts of highly pathogenic and zoonotic emerging viruses marburg virus nipah virus hendra virus rabies virus and coronaviruses while numerous studies have focused on the mentioned highly human-pathogenic bat viruses in tropical regions little is known on similar human-pathogenic viruses that may be present in european bats although novel viruses are being detected their zoonotic potential remains unclear unless further studies are conducted at present it is assumed that the risk posed by bats to the general public is rather low in this review selected viruses detected and isolated in europe are discussed from our point of view in regard to their human-pathogenic potential all european bat species and their roosts are legally protected and some european species are even endangered nevertheless the increasing public fear of bats and their viruses is an obstacle to their protection educating the public regarding bat lyssaviruses might result in reduced threats to both the public and the bats
conventional vaccine strategies have been highly efficacious for several decades in reducing mortality and morbidity due to infectious diseases the bane of conventional vaccines such as those that include whole organisms or large proteins appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that not only contributes little to the protective immune response but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences conversely peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting in this article we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by peptide vaccines and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases additionally we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with peptide vaccines
a major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis to overcome this we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation centrifugation filtration chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome containing nine highly diverse viruses and a bacterial mock-community containing four faecal bacterial species using quantitative pcr and next-generation sequencing this resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16s rrna genetic material in favour of viruses from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads furthermore our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes we propose netovir novel enrichment technique of viromes which allows for a fast reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies introducing minimal bias this procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a highly contagious disease in newborn piglets and causes substantial economic losses in the world ped virus pedv spreads by fecal-oral contact and can be prevented by oral immunization therefore it is necessary to develop an effective oral vaccine against pedv infection currently bacillus subtilis as recombinant vaccine carrier has been used for antigen delivery and proved well in immune effect and safety the present study evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant bacillus subtilis b subtilis-rc in piglets via oral administration after oral immunization in piglets b subtilis-rc significantly increased the local mucosal immune responses oral administration with b subtilis-rc significantly improved the level of specific mucosal immunoglobulin a iga antibodies against pedv infection through enlarging the area of peyer's patches pps and increasing the number of ileum iga + secreting siga cells in the meantime b subtilis-rc remarkably increased the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes iels we also observed that oral administration of b subtilis-rc significantly increased cd3 + t lymphocytes' numbers and up-regulated the ratio of cd4 + /cd8 + t cells furthermore high titers of specific serum immunoglobulin g igg revealed satisfactory systemic immune response against pedv infection in summary our study demonstrated that oral administration of b subtilis-rc could trigger a high level of local and systemic immune responses and would be a promising candidate vaccine against pedv infection in piglets
background sars-cov is the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome an understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development objective the spectrum of sars-specific antibody profiles in sars patients was investigated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms study design serial serum samples from 14 sars patients were isolated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms and were tested for anti-viral igg and igm by indirect immunofluorescence tests ifa anti-nucleocaspid antibody by elisa tests and viral neutralization results anti-viral igg and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were observed in 13 of 14 patients at 14 days after the onset of symptoms and in all 14 patients at 30-210 days thereafter anti-viral antibody igm was detected maximally at 30 days later than that for the igg class igm antibody declined and became undetectable between 60 to 180 days after the onset of the symptoms neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the sera from all of the patients with sars symptoms conclusions anti-viral igg igm and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were detected 7-30 days in patients after the onset of sars symptoms anti-viral igm antibodies disappeared earlier than igg viral neutralization was demonstrated in the sera from the convalescent patients
an experimental study was conducted to determine the comparative pathogenicity of type-2 turkey astrovirus tastv-2 obtained from turkey flocks afflicted with poult enteritis syndrome pes and from turkey flocks displaying no apparent signs of infection in total ninety 7-d-old poults which tested negative for the presence of astrovirus rotavirus coronavirus and reovirus by reverse transcriptase rt pcr were divided evenly into 3 groups a b and c birds in group a were inoculated orally with turkey astrovirus-positive intestinal contents from birds affected with pes group b received turkey astrovirus-containing intestinal contents from apparently healthy flocks group c served as a negative control and was given pbs clinical signs of diarrhea depression and dullness were observed in group a birds in group b also showed clinical signs similar to those in group a although the signs were milder in nature birds in group c did not show any clinical signs at 16 d postinoculation the bw of birds in group a was significantly lower than that of birds in groups b or c in addition the bursa size was reduced in group a but not in groups b or c birds in groups a and b but not in group c were found to shed turkey astrovirus in their feces as detected by rt-pcr these results provide a preliminary indication that tastv-2 from pes birds may be more pathogenic than tastv-2 from apparently healthy poults further studies are needed to determine if pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of tastv-2 exist in the environment these results also reinforce our previous observations that astrovirus is involved in pes causing significant retardation in growth and weight gain

this prospective clinical and virological study of 2060 otherwise healthy children aged <15 years of age 1112 males mean age ae sd 3.46 ae 3.30 years who attended the emergency department of milan university's institute of pediatrics because of an acute disease excluding trauma during the winter season 2003-2004 was designed to compare the prevalence and clinical importance of human coronaviruses hcovs in children real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed hcov infection in 79 cases 3.8% 33 hcov-229e 1.6% 13 hcov-nl63 0.6% 11 hcov-oc43 0.5% none hcov-hku1 genotype a and 22 1.1% co-detections of a hcov and another respiratory virus the hcovs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single hcov infections and hcov co-infections diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain there were a few cases of other members of the households of hcov-positive children falling ill during the 5-7 days following enrollment these findings suggest that hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts and the hcov-nl63 identified recently does not seem to be any different the quantitative and qualitative role of hcov-hku1 genotype a is apparently very marginal
wastewater treatment center wtc workers may be vulnerable to diseases caused by viruses such as the common cold influenza and gastro-intestinal infections although there is a substantial body of literature characterizing the microbial community found in wastewater only a few studies have characterized the viral component of wtc aerosols despite the fact that most diseases affecting wtc workers are of viral origin and that some of these viruses are transmitted through the air in this study we evaluated in four wtcs the presence of 11 viral pathogens of particular concern in this milieu and used a metagenomic approach to characterize the total viral community in the air of one of those wtcs the presence of viruses in aerosols in different locations of individual wtcs was evaluated and the results obtained with four commonly used air samplers were compared we detected four of the eleven viruses tested including human adenovirus hadv rotavirus hepatitis a virus hav and herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv1 the results of the metagenomic assay uncovered very few viral rna sequences in wtc aerosols however sequences from human dna viruses were in much greater relative abundance
therapeutic vaccination against cancer is an important approach which when combined with other therapies can improve long-term control of cancer in fact the induction of adaptive immune responses against tumor associated antigens taas as well as innate immunity are important factors for tumor stabilization/eradication a variety of immunization technologies have been explored in last decades and are currently under active evaluation such as cell-based protein peptide and heat-shock protein-based cancer vaccines genetic vaccines are emerging as promising methodologies to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of antigens including taas amongst these adenovirus ad-based vectors show excellent immunogenicity profile and have achieved immunological proof of concept in humans in vivo electroporation of plasmid dna dna-ep is also a desirable vaccine technology for cancer vaccines as it is repeatable several times a parameter required for the long-term maintenance of anti-tumor immunity recent findings show that combinations of different modalities of immunization heterologous prime/boost are able to induce superior immune reactions as compared to single-modality vaccines in this review we will discuss the challenges and requirements of emerging cancer vaccines particularly focusing on the genetic cancer vaccines currently under active development and the promise shown by ad and dna-ep heterologous prime-boost
companion animals including dogs are one of the important components in one health parasites may cause not only diseases in pet animals but also many zoonotic diseases infecting humans in this study we performed a survey of intestinal parasites in fecal specimens n = 485 collected from outpatient pet dogs with diarrhea in beijing china for the entire year of 2015 by microscopic examination all parasites and ssu rrna-based nested pcr detection giardia and cryptosporidium we observed a total of 124 25.6% parasite-positive specimens that contained one or more parasites including giardia duodenalis 12.8% cryptosporidium spp 4.9% cystoisospora spp 4.3% trichomonads 4.3% toxocara canis 3.5% trichuris vulpis 0.6% and dipylidium caninum 0.2%. among the 55 dog breeds infection rates were significantly higher in border collies and bulldogs but lower in poodles p < 0.05 risk factor analysis suggested that age was negatively correlated with the infection rate p < 0.00001 while vaccination and deworming in the past 12 months could significantly reduce the parasite infections p < 0.01 among the 62 giardia-positive specimens 21 were successfully assigned into assemblages using glutamate dehydrogenase gdh and/or beta-giardin bg genes including assemblage d n = 15 c n = 5 and f n = 1 among the 24 cryptosporidium-positive specimens by ssu rrna pcr 20 pcr amplicons could be sequenced and identified as cryptosporidium canis n = 20 collectively this study indicates that parasites are a significant group of pathogens in companion dogs in beijing and companion dogs may potentially transmit certain zoonotic parasites to humans particularly those with weak or weakened immunity
in this review we consider the role played by eosinophilic leukocytes in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of respiratory virus infection the vast majority of the available information on this topic focuses on respiratory syncytial virus rsv family paramyxoviridae genus pneumovirus an important pediatric pathogen that infects infants worldwide there is no vaccine currently available for rsv a formalininactivated rsv vaccine used in a trial in the 1960s elicited immunopathology in response to natural rsv infection this has been modeled experimentally primarily in inbred mice and cotton rats eosinophils are recruited to the lung tissue in response to formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine antigens in humans and in experimental models but they may or may not be involved in promoting the severe clinical sequelae observed pulmonary eosinophilia elicited in response to primary rsv infection has also been explored this response is particularly evident in the youngest human infants and in neonatal mouse models although pulmonary eosinophilia is nearly always perceived in a negative light the specific role played by virus-elicited eosinophils -negative positive or neutral bystander -remain unclear lastly we consider the data that focus on the role of eosinophils in promoting virus clearance and antiviral host defense and conclude with a recent study that explores the role of eosinophils themselves as targets of virus infection 215 words
comparative morphology of the venom apparatus in the braconid wasp subfamily rogadinae insecta hymenoptera braconidae and related taxa -zoologica scripta 33 223-237 the morphology of the venom apparatus intima in representatives of 38 genera of the problematic braconid wasp subfamily rogadinae and other cyclostome braconids was investigated and a preliminary phylogenetic analysis for the group was performed with the information obtained despite the limited number of characters the data suggest several relationships at various taxonomic levels the venom apparatus in the clinocentrini and the stiropiini is relatively unmodified and similar to that found in other genera previously placed within a broader concept of the rogadinae e g genera of lysitermini pentatermini tetratermini hormiini and also to that of the betylobraconinae the presence of a cone of filaments located inside the secondary venom duct near to its insertion on the venom reservoir / primary venom duct is proposed as a synapomorphy for the tribe rogadini to the exclusion of stiropiini clinocentrini and yeliconini other features of the secondary venom duct and its insertion on the venom reservoir / primary venom duct support a number of relationships between the genera of the rogadini and also within the large genus aleiodes . a clade containing 15 rogadini genera bathoteca bathotecoides bulborogas canalirogas colastomion conspinaria cystomastacoides macrostomion megarhogas myocron pholichora rectivena rogas spinaria and triraphis is supported by the presence of a thickened and short secondary venom duct whereas the different members of aleiodes excluding members of the subgenus heterogamus and cordylorhogas are distinguished by having a recessed secondary venom duct with welldefined and numerous internal filaments new world rogas species exhibit a unique venom apparatus and may not be closely related to the old world ones features of the venom apparatus of the enigmatic genus telengaia and the exothecine genera shawiana and colastes suggest that the telengainae and exothecinae are both closely related to the braconinae gnamptodontinae and possibly to the opiinae and alysiinae an unsculptured venom reservoir was found in one specimen of the type species of avga a choaspes which is consistent with it occupying either a very basal position within the cyclostome braconids or belonging to a recently recognized 'gondwanan' clade that also includes the aphidiinae
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv is one of the prioritized diseases of 18 world health organization considering its potential to create a public health emergency and more 19 importantly the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines regarding treatment the highly lethal 20 nature characteristic to cchfv restricts research to bsl-4 laboratories which complicates effective 21 research and developmental strategies in consideration of antiviral therapies rna interference can 22 be used to suppress viral replication by targeting viral genes rna interference uses small 23 interfering rnas sirnas to silence genes the aim of our study was to design sirnas that inhibit 24 cchfv replication and can serve as a basis for further antiviral therapies a549 cells were infected 25 with cchfv after transfection with the sirnas following 72 hours nucleic acid from the 26 supernatant was extracted for droplet digital pcr analysis among the investigated sirnas we 27 identified four effective candidates against all three segments of cchf genome one for the s and 28 m segments whilst two for the l segment consequently blocking any segment of cchfv leads to 29 changes in the virus copy number that indicates an antiviral effect of the sirnas in vitro the most 30 active sirnas were demonstrated a specific inhibitory effect against cchfv in a dose-dependent 31 manner in summary we demonstrated the ability of specific sirnas to inhibit cchfv replication 32 in vitro this promising result can be used in future anti-cchfv therapy developments.33
one of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in rna virus cross-species transmission cst events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale in 2009 the california department of public health reported a dramatic increase .350% in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in humboldt county to better understand the evolution of rabies deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the humboldt outbreak for each sample approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the illumina platform average coverage was 174486and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date 1995 vs 2009 and geographic location northern vs southern a single amino acid change in the g protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the cst event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level as rare variants in the viral population in skunk and fox samples from 1995 these results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change citation borucki mk chen-harris h lao v vanier g wadford da et al 2013 ultra-deep sequencing of intra-host rabies virus populations during cross-species transmission plos negl trop dis 711 e2555

the sand cat felis margarita is a small-sized felid found in sand and stone deserts ranging from the north of africa to asia with the arabian peninsula as its centre of distribution the sand cat captive breeding program at the breeding centre for endangered arabian wildlife bceaw sharjah uae has experienced high newborn mortality rates and congenital toxoplasmosis was recently recognized as one of the causes of this mortality in the present study one 18-month-old sand cat fm019 died of acute toxoplasmosis-associated hepatitis and pneumonitis acquired after birth toxoplasma gondii was demonstrated in histological sections which reacted with t gondii polyclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry ihc t gondii dna was found by pcr of extracted dna from liver and lung tissues of this cat antibodies to t gondii were found in serum examined in 11600 dilution in the modified agglutination test mat its 2-year-old cage mate seroconverted mat titer 13200 at the same time another sand cat fm017 was euthanized because of ill health when 3 years old its mat titer was >13200 and t gondii tissue cysts were found in brain heart ocular muscles and skeletal muscle confirmed by ihc viable t gondii was isolated by bioassays in mice inoculated with tissues of another chronically infected sand cat fm002 t gondii was not found in histological sections of this cat t gondii antibodies were found in several species of animals tested notably in 49 of 57 wild felids at bceaw a 7-year-old sand cat 3657 from al wabra wildlife preservation awwp doha state of qatar died of acute visceral toxoplasmosis with demonstrable t gondii tachyzoites by ihc and t gondii dna by pcr and a mat titer of >3200 t gondii antibodies were found in 21 of 27 of wild felids at awwp pcr-rflp genotyping at 10 genetic loci revealed that these t gondii isolates from sand cat fm002 and fm019 at bceaw have an atypical genotype which was previously reported in t gondii isolates of dogs from sri lanka the genotype from the cat from awwp 3657 is a genetic type ii strain with a type i allele at locus apico this is the first report of genetic characterization of t gondii isolates from middle east
nipah virus and hendra virus two members of the genus henipavirus are newly emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause acute respiratory illness and severe encephalitis in human lack of the effective antiviral therapy endorses the urgency for the development of vaccine against these deadly viruses in this study we employed various computational approaches to identify epitopes which has the potential for vaccine development by analyzing the immune parameters of the conserved sequences of g glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools we identified two potential epitopes which may be used as peptide vaccines using different b cell epitope prediction servers four highly similar b cell epitopes were identified immunoinformatics analyses revealed that laeddtnaqkt is a highly flexible and accessible b-cell epitope to antibody highly similar putative ctl epitopes were analyzed for their binding with the hla-c 12*03 molecule docking simulation assay revealed that ltdkigtei has significantly lower binding energy which bolstered its potential as epitope-based vaccine design finally cytotoxicity analysis has also justified their potential as promising epitope-based vaccine candidate in sum our computational analysis indicates that either laeddtnaqkt or ltdkigtei epitope holds a promise for the development of universal vaccine against all kinds of pathogenic henipavirus further in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to validate the obtained findings
background more knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases in this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores a badger meles meles a mongoose herpestes ichneumon and an otter lutra lutra from portugal results we detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed such as five gemycircularviruses four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger in addition we also identified an rna-dependent rna polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter conclusions together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution
the identification of porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 was studied in fresh intestinal tissues by polymerase chain reaction pcr and in formalin-fixed paraffin-wax-embedded intestinal tissues by in situ hybridisation the tissues came from pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv a total of 35 32.7% of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with pedv were found to be positive using pcr positive signals for pcv2 were detected in 32 29.9% of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with pedv by in situ hybridisation the distribution of positive cells in the jejunum and ileum was multifocal or patchy distinct positive labelling was found throughout the lamina propria in the small intestines the results of this study indicate that pcv2 is highly prevalent in pigs naturally infected with pedv
hendra virus causes sporadic but typically fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern australia fruit-bats of the genus pteropus commonly known as flying-foxes are the natural host of the virus and the putative source of infection in horses infected horses are the source of human infection effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy this study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported hendra virus infection in horses spatial autocorrelation global moran's i showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km a distance consistent with the foraging 'footprint' of a flying-fox roost suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering getis-ord gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern australia coast from far north queensland to central new south wales with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern queensland to northern new south wales geographically weighted regression gwr showed the density of p alecto and p conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of hendra virus for horses than p poliocephalus or p scapulatus the density of horses climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors but the residuals from the gwr suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors
despite the availability of an inactivated vaccine that has been licensed for >50 years the influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and the emergence of new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains thus there is a continued need for new efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens even from virulent influenza viruses while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity in addition a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection moreover the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses this review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines
semen is known to be a route of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv transmission a method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated prrsv rna in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference rnas as endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription rt-pcr ube2d2 mrna was selected particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of prrsv rna ube2d2 mrna is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed n = 36 however the amount of ube2d2 mrna in porcine semen varied up to 106-fold thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of prrsv rna for quantitation a synthetic non-metazoan rna was added to the rna isolation reaction at an exact copy number the photosynthesis gene ribulose-15-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit rbcl from arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike unexpectedly prrsv rna was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free spf boars which were tested elisa-negative for anti-prrsv antibodies therefore rt-pcr for seminal cell-associated prrsv is a powerful tool for managing the spf status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec strains are one of the primary causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in humans pigs and sheep igy technology has been identified as a promising alternative to generating a mass amount of specific antibody for use in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics the purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody igy to recombinant fanc protein from etec materials and methods fanc k99 gene was amplified from etec by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction the gene was cloned and subcloned into ptz57r/t and pet32a + vectors respectively recombinant vector was transferred into e coli bl21 codonplus de3 protein expression was investigated by 1 mm iptg induction hens were immunized by the purified recombinant fanc protein the activity and specificity of the igy antibody were detected by dot-blotting western blotting and indirect elisa results we obtained fanc specific igys by immunizing the hens with the recombinant fanc protein the anti-fanc igy showed binding specifically to the fanc protein of etec the results emphasize that specific igy against the recombinant fanc protein could be recommended as a candidate for passive immunization against etec infection in animals and humans
non-vaccine streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are increasingly associated with disease we evaluated isolates of the same sequence type st199 but different serotypes 15b/c 19a for growth in vitro and pathogenic potential in a chinchilla otitis media model we also developed a quantitative pcr qpcr assay to quantitatively assess each isolate circumventing the need for selectable markers in vitro studies showed faster growth of serotype 19a over 15b/c both were equally capable of colonization and middle ear infection in this model serotype 19a is included in new conjugate vaccine formulations while serotype 15b/c is not non-capsular vaccine targets will be important in disease prevention efforts
an outbreak of dual infection in dogs with canine adenovirus type 1 cav-1 and canine coronavirus ccv infection is reported in an animal shelter that comprised approximately 200 adults stray dogs and 30 puppies twenty puppies died 7±8 days after the onset of the clinical signs severe enteritis leucopoenia respiratory distress and dehydration both cav-1 and ccv were isolated from tissue or swab samples antibodies to ccv and at high levels to cav-1 also were detected in several puppies the principal histological ®ndings were atrophy of small intestinal villi lymphoid depletion hepatitis and bronchopneumonia the persistence of ccv in the faeces observed by the polymerase chain reaction assay was longer than previously reported results demonstrated the serious consequences which may occur with dual infections by cav-1 and ccv in assembled groups of dogs that are housed in poorly managed kennels with inadequate vaccination programmes
infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes a major disease problem for the poultry industry worldwide the currently used live-attenuated vaccines have the tendency to mutate and/or recombine with circulating field strains resulting in the emergence of vaccine-derived variant viruses in order to circumvent these issues and to develop a vaccine that is more relevant to egypt and its neighboring countries a recombinant avirulent newcastle disease virus rndv strain lasota was constructed to express the codon-optimized s glycoprotein of the egyptian ibv variant strain ibv/ck/eg/ cu/4/2014 belonging to gi-23 lineage that is prevalent in egypt and in the middle east a wild type and two modified versions of the ibv s protein were expressed individually by rndv a high level of s protein expression was detected in vitro by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses all rndv-vectored ibv vaccine candidates were genetically stable slightly attenuated and showed growth patterns comparable to that of parental rlasota virus single-dose vaccination of 1-day-old spf white leghorn chicks with the rndvs expressing ibv s protein provided significant protection against clinical disease after ibv challenge but did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding single-dose vaccination also provided complete protection against virulent ndv challenge however prime-boost vaccination using rndv expressing the wild type ibv s protein provided better protection after ibv challenge against clinical signs and significantly reduced tracheal viral shedding these results indicate that the ndv-vectored ibv vaccines are promising bivalent vaccine candidates to control both infectious bronchitis and newcastle disease in egypt

avian influenza virus of h9n2 subtype is pathotyped as a non-highly pathogenic virus however frequent incidences of avian influenza of high mortality that are caused by h9n2 viruses have been observed in broiler chicken farms in iran and some other asian countries coinfections or environmental factors may be involved in such cases infectious microorganisms have been implicating in taking part in the cases of coinfection we studied the effect of experimental coinfection of h9n2 avian influenza virus with infectious bronchitis live vaccine which is used extensively in chicken farms in iran clinical signs gross lesions viral shedding and mortality rate of the experimentally infected birds were examined coinfection of infectious bronchitis live vaccine and h9n2 avian influenza virus led to an extension of the shedding period of h9n2 virus increasing the severity of clinical signs and mortality rates causing macroscopic lesions in the embryos
since 1997 several epizootic avian influenza viruses aivs have been transmitted to humans causing diseases and even deaths the recent emergence of severe human infections with aiv h7n9 in china has raised concerns about efficient interpersonal viral transmission polygenic traits in viral pathogenicity and the management of newly emerging strains the symptoms associated with viral infection are different in various ai strains h5n1 and newly emerged h7n9 induce severe pneumonia and related complications in patients while some h7 and h9 subtypes cause only conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms the virulence and tissue tropism of viruses as well as the host responses contribute to the pathogenesis of human aiv infection several preventive and therapeutic approaches have been proposed to combat aiv infection including antiviral drugs such as m2 inhibitors neuraminidase inhibitors rna polymerase inhibitors attachment inhibitors and signal-transduction inhibitors etc in this article we summarize the recent progress in researches on the epidemiology clinical features pathogenicity determinants and available or potential antivirals of aiv
new strategies to prevent and treat influenza virus infections are urgently needed a recently discovered class of monoclonal antibodies mabs neutralizing an unprecedented spectrum of influenza virus subtypes may have the potential for future use in humans here we assess the efficacies of cr6261 which is representative of this novel class of mabs and oseltamivir in mice we show that a single injection with 15 mg/kg cr6261 outperforms a 5-day course of treatment with oseltamivir 10 mg/kg/day with respect to both prophylaxis and treatment of lethal h5n1 and h1n1 infections these results justify further preclinical evaluation of broadly neutralizing mabs against influenza virus for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections
in all vertebrate animals cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are controlled by major histocompatibility complex class i mhc-i molecules these are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating ctls the polymorphism of the mhc effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species we have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human mhc-i also known as human leukocyte antigen class i hla-i molecules accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors and hla tetramers for specific ctl staining and manipulation this has enabled a complete mapping of all hla-i specificities "the human mhc project". here we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species we systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine mhc-i molecule sla-1*0401 onto a hla-i molecule hla-a*1101 thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric mhc-i molecules as well as the intact sla-1*0401 molecule biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptidebinding motifs of these molecules a pan-specific predictor of peptide-mhc-i binding netmhcpan which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known hla-i molecules was successfully used to predict the specificities of the sla-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric mhc-i molecules these data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the human mhc project to other vertebrate species

porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 belongs to the viral family circoviridae and to the genus circovirus circoviruses are small single-stranded nonenveloped dna viruses that have an unsegmented circular genome pcv2 is the primary causative agent of several syndromes collectively known as porcine circovirus-associated disease pcvad many of the syndromes associated with pcvad are a result of coinfection with pcv2 virus and other agents such as mycoplasma and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus pcv2 infection is present in every major swine-producing country in the world and the number of identified cases of pcvad is rapidly increasing in the united states the disease has cost producers an average of 3-4 dollars per pig with peak losses ranging up to 20 dollars per pig the importance of this disease has stimulated investigations aimed at identifying risk factors associated with infection and minimizing these risks through modified management practices and development of vaccination strategies this paper provides an overview of current knowledge relating to pcv2 and pcvad with an emphasis on information relevant to the swine veterinarian
brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce the main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from chanteraines park hauts-de-seine france with regards to haematology population genetics immunogenic diversity resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides and community of parasites haematological parameters were measured population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci immunogenic diversity was assessed for mhc-drb frequency of the y139f mutation conferring resistance to rodenticides and two linked microsatellites were studied concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used plos one | https//doi org/10.1371/journal pone to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence eighty-six rats were caught the first haematological data for a wild urban r norvegicus population was reported genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between chanteraines rats and surrounding populations we found a high prevalence 55.8% of the mutation y139f and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals the parasite species richness was high 16 seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified together with a surprisingly high diversity of leptospira species 4 chanteraines rat population is not closed allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception furthermore the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens of which four leptospira species in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in chanteraines urban park genetics community of parasites and rodenticide resistance in an urban brown rat population plos one | https//doi
some zoonotic pathogens cause sporadic infection in humans but rarely propagate further while others have succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and becoming established in the human population adaptation driven by selection pressure in human hosts can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation we ask under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection if a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed finally how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event we distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning moreover we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred indeed after the first 100 zoonotic cases continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability finally we present a simple method for monitoring outbreaks for signs of emergence and discuss public health implications

to control and prevent the current covid-19 pandemic the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue in addition we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor t-cell and b-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus however little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 to induce host immune responses through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the sars-cov-2 sequences for hlas commonly present in the japanese population we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity <0.5%-and 2%-rank respectively to hla class i and ii molecules respectively that may induce cd8 + and cd4 + t-cell responses these epitopes distributed across the structural spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins proteins corresponding to six open reading frames however we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched by comparing the sequences of these predicted t cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses we identified 781 hla-class i and 418 hla-class ii epitopes that have high homologies to sars-cov to further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of hla molecules and found 2 hla-class i epitopes covering 83.8% of the japanese population the findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against sars-cov-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring t-cell responses
astroviruses are a common cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide and can also cause infection in a range of domestic and wild animal species canine astrovirus formally named as mamastrovirus 5 mastv5 has been reported worldwide and its role as an enteric pathogen is still controversial herein we describe the genomic characterization of a mastv5 strain crab-eating fox/2016/bra identified in a wild canid cerdocyon thous diagnosed with canine distemper virus cdv as causa mortis the nearly complete genome comprised 6579 nt in length and displayed the archetypal organization of astroviruses the present report is the first evidence of mastv5 infection in an animal species other than the dog and highlights a possible natural astrovirus spillover between domestic and wild canids moreover these results show the first evidence of extra-intestinal mastv5 suggesting a virus systemic spread this work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the astroviruses biology and their interactions with the wildlife health

urbanization is intensifying worldwide and affects the epidemiology of infectious diseases however the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds and either directly or indirectly with food production birds here we have collected samples from mallards anas platyrhynchos residing in a pond in central uppsala sweden from january 2013 to january 2014 this artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months and is a popular location where the ducks are fed resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round nine hundred and seventy seven 977 fecal samples were screened for rna viruses including influenza a virus iav avian paramyxovirus 1 avian coronavirus cov and avian astrovirus astrov this intra-annual dataset illustrates that these rna viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to iav suggesting similar ecological factors are at play furthermore in comparison to wild ducks autumnal prevalence of iav and cov are lower in this urban population we also demonstrate that astrov might be a larger burden to urban ducks than iav and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses the presence of economically relevant viruses in urban mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife food production animals and humans

there is an emerging paradigm that the human microbiome is central to many aspects of health and may have a role in preventing enteric infection entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of amebic diarrhea in developing countries it colonizes the colon lumen in close proximity to the gut microbiota interestingly not all individuals are equally susceptible to e histolytica infection therefore as the microbiota is highly variable within individuals we sought to determine if a component of the microbiota could regulate susceptibility to infection in studies utilizing a murine model we demonstrated that colonization of the gut with the commensal clostridia-related bacteria known as segmented filamentous bacteria sfb is protective during e histolytica infection sfb colonization in this model was associated with elevated cecal levels of interleukin 17a il-17a dendritic cells and neutrophils bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdcs from sfb-colonized mice had higher levels of il-23 production in response to stimulation with trophozoites adoptive transfer of bmdcs from an sfb ؉ to an sfb ؊ mouse was sufficient to provide protection against e histolytica il-17a induction during bmdc transfer was necessary for this protection importance entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amebiasis an infectious disease that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea in the developing world we showed in a murine model that colonization with the commensal members of the clostridia known as sfb provides protection against e histolytica and that dendritic cells from sfbcolonized mice alone can recapitulate protection understanding interactions between enteropathogens commensal intestinal bacteria and the mucosal immune response including dendritic cells will help in the development of effective treatments for this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases the demonstration of immune-mediated protection due to communication from the microbiome to the bone marrow represents an emerging field of study that will yield unique approaches to the development of these treatments . wa 2014 bone marrow dendritic cells from mice with an altered microbiota provide interleukin 17a-dependent protection against entamoeba histolytica colitis mbio 56e01817-14
coccidiosis is an economically significant disease of poultry caused by species of eimeria a parasitic protozoan disease can result in poor feed conversion reduced weight gain and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis for prevention of coccidiosis poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery traditionally coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent however new technology using gel diluents has entered the us market gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are "dropped" onto chicks with an applicator bar it is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts in this experiment the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent a more viscous gel diluent and a less viscous gel diluent was compared fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding shedding in the first cycle days 5 to 8 post-vaccination was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts however a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle days 12 to 15 post-vaccination chickens were challenged with eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications all vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring the results of this project indicate that all vaccine applications are effective at protecting against eimeria maxima challenge when using a proper dose of vaccine that allows for repeated oocyst cycling in the litter post-vaccination
infectious bronchitis ib generated by the infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes economic difficulties for livestock farmers the 3d8 single chain variable fragment scfv protein is a recombinant antibody with nuclease activity that shows antiviral effects against various dna and rna viruses in mice and chickens in this experiment 3d8 scfv g 2 transgenic chickens produced by crossing 3d8 scfv g 1 transgenic rooster and wild type hens were screened by genomic pcr and immunohistochemistry analysis 3d8 scfv transgenic chickens wild type sibling chickens and spf chickens were directly infected with ibv 5 chickens per group and indirectly infected by airborne propagation 15 chickens per group the relative ibv shedding titers were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on days 3 and 5 after intraocular infection the viral load was significantly decreased in the 3d8 scfv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group additionally blood was collected from each group on day 17 post-infection the elisa results showed a marked reduction of the antibody titer against ibv in the 3d8 scfv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group these results suggest that the 3d8 scfv protein potentially inhibits infectious bronchitis virus transmission in chickens
a systemic disease of domestic ferrets characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation was first recognized in europe and the united states in 2002 the disease closely resembled feline infectious peritonitis and subsequently has been shown to be associated with ferret systemic coronavirus frscv a definitive laboratory diagnosis of this disease is typically based on a combination of immunohistochemistry ihc and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests to detect frscv in granulomatous lesions in 2010 this feline infectious peritonitis-like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in japan and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to ihc this report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to japanese veterinary hospitals both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by ihc in 1 case for which unfixed tissues were available frscv rna was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues
human metapneumovirus hmpv is a significant cause of respiratory illness in children and adults presently there are no human data regarding the role of antibody for protection against hmpv illness therefore we measured serum and nasal antibody titers against hmpv by eia and neutralization assay at baseline in hmpv infected adults compared with subjects who remained uninfected antibody titers were also compared in patients with mild and severe illness mean serum binding and neutralizing antibody titers of hmpv infected subjects were significantly lower compared to uninfected subjects seventy-one percent of subjects with titers ≤10.5 log 2 were infected compared to 36% with titers >10.5 p = 0.003 there was no difference in the mean acute antibody titers for patients with mild compared to severe illness serum antibody may play a role in protection from hmpv infection supporting the development of an hmpv vaccine that stimulates humoral immunity
background cryptosporidium spp are zoonotic parasites responsible for diarrhoeal diseases in animals and humans worldwide cattle are the most common mammalian species in which cryptosporidium is detected with pre-weaned calves considered to be reservoirs for zoonotic c parvum in october 2013 severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves at a farm in the ningxia autonomous region of northwestern china 356 of the infected calves died despite antibiotic therapy findings 252 faecal samples were collected from the investigated farm the identity of cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp analysis and by dna sequence analysis of the small subunit ssu rrna gene c parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene the highest infection rate of 83.3% 40/48 was seen in 2-3-week-old calves with diarrhoea corresponding to the age at which animals died three cryptosporidium species were identified including c parvum n = 51 c bovis n = 1 and c ryanae n = 1 all c parvum isolates were further identified as subtype iida15g1 conclusions cryptosporidium parvum was likely to be most responsible for diarrhoea and death this is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by c parvum iida15g1 in chinese dairy cattle
objectives to determine the prevalence of nine canine infectious respiratory disease cird pathogens in asymptomatic dogs presented at animal shelters across the united states methods ocular and oronasal swabs from asymptomatic dogs n = 503 were tested using qpcr assay for bordetella bronchiseptica canine adenovirus type 2 cav-2 canine distemper virus cdv canine herpesvirus type 1 chv canine influenza virus civ canine parainfluenza virus cpiv canine respiratory coronavirus crcov mycoplasma cynos and streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus results a total of 240 47·7% asymptomatic dogs were pcr-positive for at least one cird pathogen prevalence of two- three- four- and five-pathogen cases was 12·7 3·8 1·8 and 0·4% respectively mycoplasma cynos 29·2% b bronchiseptica 19·5% cav-2 12·5% cdv 7·4% and cpiv 3·2%were the most commonly detected pathogens clinical significance the prevalence of traditional and newly emerging pathogens associated with cird is poorly defined in clinically healthy dogs this study determined that a high percentage of asymptomatic shelter dogs harbor cird pathogens including the newly emerging pathogen m cynos and the historically prevalent pathogen b bronchiseptica
rotavirus is the most important etiologic agent of severe gastroenteritis previously we reported that skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum scblc obtained from normal unimmunized cows at 6 to 7 d after parturition effectively prevented against human rotavirus hrv-induced severe gastroenteritis in vivo when administered as a single dose 60 min before viral inoculation in the present study we examined the efficacy of multiple administrations of scblc at smaller dosages after viral inoculation in vivo we demonstrate that multiple administrations within 24 h after virus inoculation resulted in earlier recovery from diarrheal symptoms in an administration frequencydependent manner furthermore we investigated whether isolated igg anti-hrv activity in scblc was equivalent to that of igg isolated from bovine mature milk as measured by in vitro activity assays we found that igg-containing fractions from scblc and mature milk exhibited approximately the same level of anti-hrv activity we concluded that the scblc contains a high level of igg against hrv-induced severe gastroenteritis which will be possible to use in protective effects in immunocompromised hosts such as children and the elderly multiple doses of scblc during the early stages of infection or lower dosage of scblc given as a single dose both resulted in relief of diarrheal symptoms
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec is one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhea almost all etec bacteria are known to adhere to receptors on the small intestinal epithelium via their fimbriae f5 k99 and f41 this study was undertaken to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic screening of virulence genes in e coli k99 and f41 during january 2008 to december 2009 298 diarrheic neonatal calves at 1-30 days old were studied by multiplex pcr isolation and serological grouping of the 298 diarrheic samples 268 e coli were isolated of which 16 samples 5.3% were positive for having the f5 k99 fimbrial gene by pcr while all of the e coli isolates also carried f41 fimbrial genes twenty-five percent of the isolates were proven not to be toxigenic as they did not possess the sta enterotoxin gene
that ectoparasites might serve as viral vectors but evidence to date is scant bat flies in particular are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that incidentally bite humans using nextgeneration sequencing we discovered a novel ledantevirus mononegaviral family rhabdoviridae genus ledantevirus in nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western uganda mitochondrial dna analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to putative new species the coding-complete genome of the new virus named kanyawara virus kyav is only distantly related to that of its closest known relative mount elgon bat virus and was found at high titers in bat flies but not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats viral genome analysis indicates unusually low cpg dinucleotide depletion in kyav compared to other ledanteviruses and rhabdovirus groups with kyav displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of arthropods our findings highlight the possibility of a yetto-be-discovered diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites
adenoviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals bats have been recognized as potential reservoirs of novel viruses with some viruses being regarded as a possible zoonotic threat to humans in this study we report the detection and analysis of adenoviruses from different bat species in northern italy upon sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on a short diagnostic fragment of the highly-conserved dna polymerase gene we identified potential novel candidate adenovirus species including an avian-like adenovirus strain an adenovirus isolate was obtained in simian cell lines from the carcass of a pipistrellus kuhlii and the complete genome sequence was reconstructed using deep sequencing technologies the virus displayed high nucleotide identity and virtually the same genome organization as the pipistrellus pipistrellus strain ppv1 isolated in germany in 2007 gathering data on epidemiology and the genetic diversity of bat adenoviruses may be helpful to better understand their evolution in the mammalian and avian hosts
astroviruses astv are single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses best known for causing diarrhea in humans and are also found in many other mammals in those the relevance in gastroenteritis remains unclear recently described neurotropic astv showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals in switzerland two different neurotropic astv were identified in cattle as well as one in a sheep the high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine astv strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission in humans astv associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions such as immunosuppression whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown the aims of this study were 1 the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic astv in feces samples 2 the discovery and analysis of so far unknown astv in small ruminants and other ruminant species' fecal samples and 3 the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of astv to achieve these aims rna extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic astv occurring in switzerland as well as for various astv using rt-pcr positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing the generated sequences were compared to nucleotide-and amino acid databases virus properties were identified and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed the excretion of neurotropic astv in small ruminants' feces could not be demonstrated but this work suggests the first identification of astv in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species additionally the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission the findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown astv in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of astv in small ruminants subjects veterinary medicine virology
murine models of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov will greatly advance research on this emerging virus when balb/c mice were simultaneously inoculated intranasally and orally replication of sars-cov was found in both lung and intestinal tissue
influenza vaccines that target the highly variable surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase cause inconvenience of having vaccination every year for this reason development of universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components is needed in this study we generated recombinant adenovirus rad vaccine encoding nucleoprotein np of a/pr/8/34 influenza virus designated rad/np balb/c mice were immunized intranasally or sublingually with rad/np vaccine and subsequently challenged with lethal doses of heterologous as well as homologous influenza viruses we found that intranasal immunization of rad/np elicited strong mucosal iga responses as well as stronger cd8 t-cell responses toward immunodominant k d -restricted np 147-155 epitope than sublingual immunization importantly only single intranasal but not sublingual immunization of rad/np provides potent protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges these results suggest that recombinant rad/np could be a universal vaccine candidate for mucosal administration against influenza virus
the immunoelectron microscopy iem technique has been used for the detection of a rabbit enteric coronavirus recv immune serum was prepared in guinea pigs the viral antigen used for the immunization procedure was obtained from the caecum of a sick rabbit concentrated by centrifugation and purified on percoll gradient in order to identify the viral particles used in the immunization procedure the protein pattern of the particles was determined by electrophoresis and compared with the pattern of other known coronaviruses analysis of structural polypeptides of the purified viral particles revealed a pattern similar to that reported for other coronaviruses these polypeptides cross reacted with two other coronavirus specific immune sera ibv and tge iem assay of fecal samples collected from healthy and sick rabbits showed the presence of immune aggregates in specimens from both sick and healthy rabbits those aggregates contained viral particules sharing morphological characteristics with other coronaviruses furthermore iem assay was shown to be more sensitive than a direct em procedure to detect coronavirus particles in rabbit feces this assay also allowed the detection of a larger number of chronic carriers
theileria parva t parva causes east coast fever ecf which is of huge economic importance to eastern and southern african countries in a previous bovine model inflammatory cytokines were closely associated with disease progression in animals experimentally infected with t parva the african cape buffalo syncerus caffer the natural reservoir for t parva is completely resistant to ecf despite a persistently high parasitaemia following infection with t parva characterizing basic immunological interactions in the host is critical to understanding the mechanism underlying disease resistance in the african cape buffalo in this study the expression level of several cytokines was analyzed in t parva-infected buffaloes there were no significant differences in the expression profiles of inflammatory cytokines between the infected and uninfected animals despite a remarkably high parasitaemia in the former however the expression level of il-10 was significantly upregulated in the infected animals these results indicate a correlation between diminished inflammatory cytokines response and disease resistance in the buffalo
porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv a spike s gene deletion mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev causes mild or subclinical respiratory infections in pigs the shedding of prcv/tgev was studied at different days post-arrival in fecal and nasal swabs from prcv/tgev seronegative sentinel pigs introduced into a prcv seropositive herd with questionable tgev serology and diarrhea nasal shedding of prcv was detected in 57% and 63% of samples by nested-rt-pcr and cell culture immunofluorescence ccif respectively however fecal shedding of prcv was detected in 37% of the samples by nested-rt-pcr and 19% by ccif four respiratory and 5 fecal prcv strains were isolated in swine testicle cells including nasal/fecal prcv pairs isolated at the same time from 3 pigs comparison of nasal/fecal prcv pairs from individual pigs revealed different deletions in the spike s gene 648 or 681 nt in 2 pairs and a consistent change in nt 790/791 aa t to v for all pairs in preliminary studies inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with each plaque-purified pair of the nasal and fecal prcv isolates revealed no clinical disease but different tropisms the nasal isolate was shed both nasally and in feces but the fecal isolate was shed only marginally in feces and not nasally our results show that nested-rt-pcr was as sensitive as ccif for prcv detection in nasal swabs but was more sensitive than ccif for prcv detection in fecal samples alternatively prcv shed in feces was more labile with loss of infectivity the s-gene sequence differences found between the fecal and respiratory prcv isolates may influence their tissue tropism these new prcv isolates should be useful to understand the molecular basis of coronavirus tropism and evolution in infected swine 958 v costantini et al
necrotic enteritis in sucking piglets constitutes a serious problem in piglet rearing units because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with the disease the primary causal agent is clostridium perfringens type c the l-toxin plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of this disease a toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials the european pharmacopoeia monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti-toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin the vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 iu of l-anti-toxin per ml of rabbit serum we have established a range of 17.14^98.23 iu l-anti-toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of c perfringens toxoid vaccine the vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease the outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses use of the vaccine coupled with other measures resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of losses ß
certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa- lyssa- corona- and filoviruses which may pose serious threats to human health the commonvampire bat desmodus rotundus due to its abundance sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals and highly social behavioral ecology may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in d rotundus yet the diversity of other viruses bacteria and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown we screened 396 blood urine saliva and fecal samples from d rotundus captured in guatemala for 13 viral families and genera positive results were found for rhabdovirus adenovirus and herpesvirus assays we also screened these samples for bartonella spp and found that 38% of individuals tested positive to characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated with feeding behavior we also analyzed cytochrome b sequences from fecal samples to identify prey species and found that domestic cattle bos taurus made up the majority of blood meals our findings suggest that the risk of pathogen spillover from desmodus rotundus including between domestic animal species is possible and warrants further investigation to characterize this microbial diversity and expand our understanding of foraging ecology in their populations
the success of lentiviral vectors in curing fatal genetic and acquired diseases has opened a new era in human gene therapy however variability in the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic approach has been reported in human patients consequently lentiviral-vector-based gene therapy is limited to incurable human diseases with little understanding of the underlying causes of adverse effects and poor efficacy to assess the role that host genetic variation has on efficacy of gene therapy we characterized lentiviral-vector gene therapy within a set of 12 collaborative cross mouse strains lentiviral vectors carrying the firefly luciferase cdna under the control of a liver-specific promoter were administered to female mice with total-body and hepatic luciferase expression periodically monitored through 41 weeks post-vector administration vector copy number per diploid genome in mouse liver and spleen was determined at the end of this study we identified major strain-specific contributions to overall success of transduction vector biodistribution maximum luciferase expression and the kinetics of luciferase expression throughout the study our results highlight the importance of genetic variation on gene-therapeutic efficacy provide new models with which to more rigorously assess gene therapy approaches and suggest that redesigning preclinical studies of gene-therapy methodologies might be appropriate
with very few adjuvants currently being used in marketed human vaccines a critical need exists for novel immunopotentiators and delivery vehicles capable of eliciting humoral cellular and mucosal immunity such crucial vaccine components could facilitate the development of novel vaccines for viral and parasitic infections such as hepatitis hiv malaria cancer etc in this review we discuss clinical trial results for various vaccine adjuvants and delivery vehicles being developed that are approximately nanoscale b1000 nm in size humoral immune responses have been observed for most adjuvants and delivery platforms while only viral vectors iscoms and montanide™ isa 51 and 720 have shown cytotoxic t cell responses in the clinic mf59 and mpl® have elicited th1 responses and virus-like particles non-degradable nanoparticles and liposomes have also generated cellular immunity such vaccine components have also been evaluated for alternative routes of administration with clinical successes reported for intranasal delivery of viral vectors and proteosomes and oral delivery of a vlp vaccine published by elsevier b v
a fixed-cell elisa was developed using swine testicle st cells infected with the virulent miller strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and purified biotinylated monoclonal antibodies b-mabs five of the b-mabs were specific for the peplomer e 2 five reacted to the nucleocapsid n and one reacted to the e 1 protein of the miller strain of tgev protein a-sepharose purification of mabs yielded protein concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 3 mg per ml of ascites separate pools of n-mabs and e 2-mabs and the e 1-mab were used to monitor synthesis of tge viral antigen in st cells from 0 to 16 h post-infection at various multiplicities of infection moi epitopes of n proteins appeared sooner and at a lower moi than those for the e 1 and e 2 proteins the fixed-cell elisa was also used to examine relative binding affinities of tgev mabs concentrations of b-mabs producing a halfmaximal signal ranged from 0.11 to 3.8 pg/ml for e2-mabs from 0.05 to 0.82 gg/ml for n-mabs and 6 gg/ml for the e 1-mab the assay was used to determine the 50% neutralization concentrations for four neutralizing e2-mabs 0.1 lag/ml to 6.9 gg/ml and one e 1-mab 1.2 gg/ml competition assays between b-mabs and unlabeled competitors indicated that at least two major antigenic sites exist on the e2-protein and 2 to 3 antigenic sites are present on the n-protein of miller tgev
a stray female cat of unknown age presenting bright red watery diarrhea was submitted to the animal and plant quarantine agency for diagnosis in the small intestines extracted from the necropsied cat numerous white ovalshaped organisms were firmly embedded in the mucosa and there was thickening of intestinal wall histopathological analysis revealed severe necrotizing enteritis together with atrophied intestinal villi exfoliated enterocytes and parasitic worms recovered worms were identified as pharyngostomum cordatum by morphological observation and genetic analysis although p cordatum is known to occur widely in korea this is the first clinical description of an infection by p cordatum causing severe feline enteritis
h9n2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in asia we evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian h9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture h9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of h9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung this may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase na cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid sia rather than carbon-3-linked sia the modified cleavage of n-acetlylneuraminic acid neu5ac and n-glycolylneuraminic acid neu5gc by na in h9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics and recombinant h9n2 viruses with amino acids 38kq deleted in the na stalk and changing the amino acid at position 431 from proline-to-lysine using recombinant h9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures the existing risk assessment models for h9n2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract the inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk-assessment strategies most influenza viruses are widely established in the waterfowl population while much attention has been given to the h5n1 and h7n9 subtypes because of their disease severity in humans another subtype h9n2 has widely circulated in poultry in many regions of the world h9n2 was first detected in turkeys in 1966 shorebirds in 1988 and then in ducks and chickens 1 2 . it is now the most widespread and prevalent influenza virus in asia the government of hong kong special administrative region implemented interventions starting from 2001 to control this infection by executing a mandatory monthly rest day live quail sale ban and in the subsequent years a biweekly rest day in the wet markets prior to these interventions in live bird market trading the h9n2 virus isolation rate in hong kong's live poultry markets was around 5% of all birds tested increasing to almost 20% in game-birds such as quail 3 . these isolation rates are presumably similar in the greater china region in which h9n2 is regarded as the most prevalent subtype of influenza in chickens reviewed in ref 4 where market interventions applied in hong kong have not been used phylogenetic analysis has shown that the three main lineages korean g1 and chicken/beijing/1/94-like of h9n2 viruses have developed from ck/bei and reassorted with other h9 strains 1 .even though h9n2 infection is mainly confined to poultry h9n2 viruses have been detected repeatedly in swine in china 5 6 . laboratory confirmed cases of h9n2 infection in humans have been reported in published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/ 2 scientific reports | 7 6208 |
a new viral sequence likely belonging to a virus of the family astroviridae was determined using the gut content of chickens affected with the runting-stunting syndrome rss in chickens since the appropriate virus could not be isolated in cell culture the open reading frame of the viral capsid protein was cloned to generate a recombinant baculovirus the protein was purified and used as an experimental vaccine in broiler breeders to provide maternal derived antibodies for the protection of the offspring the presence of specific antibodies was monitored by an elisa the offspring of vaccinated breeder hens were partially protected in a rss challenge model
twelve dogs dead as consequence of natural infection caused by canine parvovirus cpv type 2a n = 4 type 2b n = 4 or type 2c n = 4 were investigated for determining the viral dna loads in different tissue samples by means of a real-time pcr assay cpv dna was detected in all tissues examined with the highest titres observed in the lymphoid tissue and the lowest loads in the urinary tract surprisingly the nervous tissue was found to contain considerable amounts of cpv nucleic acid similar patterns of tissue distribution were observed in all the examined dogs irrespective of the antigenic variant causing the disease #
indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa enables detection and quantification of antigenspecific antibodies in biological samples such as human or animal sera most current mers-cov serological assays such as neutralization immunofluorescence or protein microarray rely on handling of live mers-cov in high containment laboratories highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and reagents representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited in this chapter we describe a validated and optimized indirect elisa protocol based on recombinant s1 subunit amino acids 1-725 of mers-cov for qualitative and quantitative determination of mers-covbinding antibodies
here we describe casuarina virus casv a new virus in the family mesoniviridae this is the first report of a mesonivirus in australia which extends the geographical range of this virus family to 3 continents the virus was isolated in 2010 from coquillettidia xanthogaster mosquitoes during surveillance in the suburbs of darwin the capital of the northern territory cryo-electron microscopy of the casv virions revealed spherical particles of 65 nm in size with large club-shaped projections of approximately 15 nm in length the new virus was most closely related to alphamesonivirus 1 the only currently recognized species in the family in 2013 a further 5 putative new mesonivirus species were described hana méno nsé moumo and dak nong viruses the evolutionary distance between casv and two of its closest relatives cavally and hana viruses jones-taylor-thornton distance of 0.151 and 0.224 respectively along with its isolation from a different genus of mosquitoes captured on a separate continent indicate that casv is a new species
as the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold human rhinovirus hrv is the leading cause of human infectious disease early studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated hrv vaccine can be protective and virus-neutralizing antibodies nab correlated with protection however co-circulation of many hrv types discouraged further vaccine efforts here we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated hrv vaccine may result in broad nab responses we show that serum nab against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent inactivated hrvs plus alhydrogel alum adjuvant using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques hrv vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response thus we have generated a vaccine capable of inducing nab responses to numerous and diverse hrv types
astroviruses are small round viruses that cause enteric disease in the young of several species detection and diagnosis of astrovirus infection in non-human hosts relies heavily on electron microscopy and fluorescent antibody tests recently our laboratory isolated and sequenced an avian astrovirus from poult enteritis mortality syndrome affected turkeys these studies describe the development of rt-pcr methods which specifically detect regions of the viral capsid and polymerase genes and demonstrate their use in detecting astrovirus infection in commercial turkey flocks
infectious bronchitis virus ibv is an endemic disease of chickens and a major contributor to economic losses for the poultry industry despite vaccination recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for ibv therefore we hypothesized that early ibv vaccination will generate an immature poorly protective ibv-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of ibv to test this hypothesis the ibv-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages this demonstrated a delayed production of igg and iga plasma antibodies in the 1 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower iga antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group similar observations were made for antibodies in tears in addition igg antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds the delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower igg avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon ibv field strain challenge the lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected these data strongly support ibv vaccination after day 7 post hatch
arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses are an important threat to human and animal health globally among these zoonotic diseases account for billions of cases of human illness and millions of deaths every year representing an increasing public health problem chikungunya virus belongs to the genus alphavirus of the family togariridae and is transmitted mainly by the bite of female mosquitoes of the aedes aegypti and/or a albopictus species the focus of this review will be on the medicinal chemistry of chikungunya virus including synthetic and natural products as well as rationally designed compounds
background analysis of human monoclonal antibodies mabs developed from hiv-1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein the third variable region v3 is a crucial target on gp120 primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor cxcr4 or ccr5 binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies methods thirty-three hiv-1 seropositive drug naive patients 18 males and 15 females within the age range of 20-57 years median = 33 years were recruited in this study for mab production the mabs were selected from ebv transformed cultures with conformationally constrained cholera-toxin-b containing v3c v3c-ctb fusion protein we tested the mabs for their binding with hiv-1 derived proteins and peptides by elisa and for neutralization against hiv-1 viruses by tzm-bl assays we isolated three anti-v3 mabs 277 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals the elisa binding revealed a subtype-c and subtype-a specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mab 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-b v3 epitope mapping of mabs with overlapping v3 peptides showed exclusive binding to v3 crown the antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively overall we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-v3 mabs despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses du156.12 and jrfl suggesting that the affinity of mab might equally be crucial for neutralization as the epitope recognition our study suggests that the anti-v3 antibodies derived from subtype-c infected indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses defining the fine epitope specificities of these mabs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes unique to clade c or shared with non-clade c viruses in context of v3 region
bovine coronavirus bcov is one of the main causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea several diagnostic assays have been employed to detect the presence of the virus in stool samples from calves despite this the frequency of bcov infection among brazilian and even south american cattle herds has yet to be well characterised this study describes the occurrence of bcov infection among calves from dairy and beef herds in four brazilian states a total of 282 stool samples from 1 to 60-day-old calves were evaluated for the presence of bcov by a semi-nested sn pcr assay the animals were from herds n= 23 located in three geographical regions in brazil south southeast and center-west the specific bcov amplicon was detected in 15.6% 44/282 of the faecal specimens examined of which 95.4% 42/ 44 were from diarrhoeic and 4.6% 2/44 from asymptomatic calves the specificity of the sn-pcr amplicons was evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp analysis the results show that the bcov is widespread mainly among calves from 16 to 30-days-old p=0.0023 and verify the association between bcov infection and clinical signs of diarrhoea p=0.005 these findings emphasise the importance of this virus in enteric infections of brazilian cattle herds

this review focuses on reports of hepatitis e virus hantavirus rotavirus coronavirus and arenavirus in synanthropic rodents rattus rattus rattus norvegicus and mus musculus within urban environments despite their potential impact on human health relatively few studies have addressed the monitoring of these viruses in rodents comprehensive control and preventive activities should include actions such as the elimination or reduction of rat and mouse populations sanitary education reduction of shelters for the animals and restriction of the access of rodents to residences water and food supplies
v920 rvsvdg-zebov-gp is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis-zaire ebolavirus vaccine which has shown an acceptable safety profile and provides a protective immune response against ebola virus disease evd induced by zaire ebolavirus in humans the purpose of this study was to determine whether the v920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes while the v920 vaccine replicated well in vero cells no replication was observed in anopheles or aedes mosquito culicoides biting midge or lutzomyia sand fly cells nor in live culex or aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal the insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of vsv v920 vaccine inoculated into cx quinquefasciatus and ae aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed following administration of an infectious blood meal to ae aegypti and cx quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log 10 pfu more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals no infection or dissemination of v920 was observed in either mosquito species in vitro and in vivo data gathered during this study support minimal risk of the vector-borne potential of the v920 vaccine
immunological memory is important for protecting the host from reinfection to investigate the development and sites of residence of intestinal memory b cells and their role in protective immunity to reinfection with an enteric virus we assessed the association between memory b cell and antibody-secreting cell asc responses and protection using a gnotobiotic pig model for human rotavirus hrv infection and diarrhoea the isotypes quantities and tissue distribution of rotavirus-speci®c memory b cells and asc were evaluated prechallenge 28 and 83 postinoculation days and postchallenge 7 postchallenge days using enzyme-linked immunospot elispot assay in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated once with virulent or three times with attenuated hrv and challenged at pid 28 with the corresponding virulent hrv complete protection against hrv shedding and diarrhoea was associated with signi®cantly higher numbers of immunoglobulin a iga and immunoglobulin g igg memory b cells and asc in the ileum of virulent hrv-inoculated pigs at challenge in contrast pigs inoculated with attenuated hrv had lower numbers of iga and igg memory b cells and asc in intestinal lymphoid tissues but higher numbers in the spleen the bone marrow had the lowest mean numbers of iga and igg memory b cells and asc prechallenge in both groups of hrv-inoculated pigs therefore bone marrow was not a site for iga and igg rotavirus-speci®c antibody production or for memory b cells after inoculation with live rotavirus from 28 pid up to at least 83 pid the effect of in vitro antigen dose was examined and it was determined to play an important role in the development of asc from memory b cells for the different tissues examined
several technologies have been developed to isolate human antibodies against different target antigens as a source of potential therapeutics including hybridoma technology phage and yeast display systems for conventional antibodies this involves either random pairing of vh and variable light vl domains in combinatorial display libraries or isolation of cognate pairs of vh and vl domains from human b cells or from transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin loci followed by single-cell sorting single-cell rt-pcr and bulk cloning of isolated natural vh-vl pairs heavy-chain-only antibodies hcabs that naturally occur in camelids require only heavy immunoglobulin chain cloning here we present an automatable novel high-throughput technology for rapid direct cloning and production of fully human hcabs from sorted population of transgenic mouse plasma cells carrying a human hcab locus utility of the technique is demonstrated by isolation of diverse sets of sequence unique soluble high-affinity influenza a strain x-31 hemagglutinin-specific hcabs
feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv is a coronavirus that induces a fatal systemic disease mediated by an inappropriate immune response most previous vaccination attempts against fipv were unsuccessful because igg antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection however two studies have shown that poxvirus vectors vaccinia wr and canarypox expressing only the fipv membrane m protein can elicit a partially protective immunity which is supposed to be cell-mediated virology 181 1991 327 international patent wo 97/20054 1997 in our study we report the construction of another poxvirus the modified vaccinia virus ankara mva as an expression vector for the fipv m protein in this vector the m gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the m protein during their early stage only the immunogenicity of the recombinant mva-m was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the th1/th2 balance the vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an fipv 79-1146 challenge vaccinated kittens developed fipv-specific antibodies after immunization however none of them was protected against fipv our results suggest a crucial role for the type of poxviral promoter that must be used to induce an effective immune response against fipv
newcastle disease virus ndv is an avian virus that is attenuated in primates and is a potential vaccine vector for human use we evaluated ndv as a vector for expressing selected antigens of the lyme disease pathogen borrelia burgdorferi a series of recombinant ndvs were generated that expressed intracellular or extracellular forms of two b burgdorferi antigens namely the basic membrane protein a bmpa and the outer surface protein c ospc expression of the intracellular and extracellular forms of these antigens was confirmed in cultured chicken cells c3h or balb/c mice that were immunized intranasally with the ndv vectors mounted vigorous serum antibody responses against the ndv vector but failed to mount a robust response against either the intracellular or extracellular forms of bmpa or ospc by contrast a single immunization of hamsters with the ndv vectors via the intranasal intramuscular or intraperitoneal route resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the intracellular or extracellular forms of bmpa and ospc when groups of hamsters were separately inoculated with various ndv vectors and challenged with b burgdorferi 10 8 cells/animal immunization with vector expressing either intracellular or extracellular bmpa was associated with a significant reduction of the pathogen load in the joints taken together our studies highlighted the importance of ndv as vaccine vector that can be used for simple yet effective immunization of hosts against bacterial infections including lyme disease
since late 2010 highly virulent pedv g2-genotype strains have emerged globally extracting heavy losses on the pork industries of numerous countries we investigated the characteristics of a field strain of pedv pedv strain sh isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in shanghai china whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the sh strain belonged to subtype g2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion aa 399-410 including the antigenic epitope nep-1c9 aa 398-406 of the n protein pedv sh strain is highly pathogenic to challenged newborn piglets resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of infected piglets mice inoculated with inactivated pedv sh produced antibodies against the n protein but no antibodies against the deletions these results illustrated that deletion of the nep-1c9 epitope had no effect on the immunogenicity or pathogenicity of pedv providing evidence of the necessity to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus our study also contributes to development of candidate for vaccines and diagnostics that could differentiate pigs seropositive due to vaccination by conventional strains from wild virus infection
during the hunting season in march 2012 a total of 93 blood samples were collected from wild boars sus scrofa shot in the area of northern turkey samsun and gumushane provinces these blood samples were examined by enzyme immunoassay elisa for the presence of antibodies to classical swine fever virus csfv aujeszky's disease virus adv porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv swine influenza virus siv porcine parvovirus ppv swine vesicular disease virus svdv hepatitis e virus hev african swine fever virus asfv porcine rotavirus prv transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and bovine viral diarrhoea virus bvdv out of 93 serum samples examined 65 69.9 % were positive for prv 2223.7 % were positive for adv 5 5.4 % were positive for bvdv 4 4.3 % were positive for ppv and 2 2.2 % were positive for prrsv all sera were negative for asfv svdv hev siv prcv tgev and csfv the results recorded for the first time in turkey supported the hypothesis that wild boar act as a potential reservoir of selected viruses and thus have a role in the epidemiology of these diseases
background the avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv remains a significant source of loss in the poultry industry and early diagnosis is required to prevent the disease from spreading this study examined the combined use of an elisa and western blot wb to detect antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein n of ibv the coding sequence for n was amplified by rt-pcr and expressed in escherichia coli a soluble recombinant n protein rn of approximately 50 kda was obtained a total of 389 sera were tested against the rn in elisa and the results were compared with those of the commercial idexx ibv ab test elisa-rn achieved a 90.34% sensitivity and 90.16% specificity wb confirmed all false negative sera in elisa-rn or idexx test as truly positive the current study indicate that the combined use of rn in elisa and wb is a powerful tool for the immunodiagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis
influenza viruses are a continuous and severe global threat to mankind and many animal species the re-emerging disease gives rise to thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses each year the devastating results of the recent outbreaks of avian influenza in europe and south east asia demonstrate this immanent danger the major problem in fighting the flu is the high genetic variability of the virus this results in the rapid formation of variants that escape the acquired immunity against previous virus strains or confer resistance to anti-viral agents despite successful vaccination against circulating strains causing annual epidemics the number of admitted measures to fight acute infection in risk patients is limited and quarantine is of limited help as the virus transmitted before onset of symptoms this poses an even greater challenge when a completely new virus should hit the human population without preexisting immunity and start a pandemic therefore the development of effective drugs against viral functions or essential cellular activities supporting viral replication is of outmost importance today
we investigated whether the surface-linked liposomal peptide was applicable to a vaccine based on cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov we first identified four hla-a*0201-restricted ctl epitopes derived from sars-cov using hla-a*0201 transgenic mice and recombinant adenovirus expressing predicted epitopes these peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes and inoculated into mice two of the liposomal peptides were effective for peptide-specific ctl induction and one of them was efficient for the clearance of vaccinia virus expressing epitopes of sars-cov suggesting that the surface-linked liposomal peptide might offer an effective ctlbased vaccine against sars
sapelovirus a sv-a is currently spreading as an enteric pathogen of pigs worldwide we isolated sv-a strain xtnd/2018 from the small intestine of a dead pig with severe diarrhea in the north of vietnam and determined the genomic sequence this is the first report of the genomic sequence of sv-a circulating in vietnam
the faecal microbiota plays a critical role in host health with alterations in the human faecal microbial composition associated with various conditions particularly diarrhoeal diseases however little is known about microbial changes during cryptosporidiosis one of the most important diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa in cattle in this study alterations in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves as a result of cryptosporidium parvum infection were investigated on a c parvum-positive farm comparisons were made among groups of c parvum-infected rotavirus-infected and the pathogen-negative calves a specific increase in the abundance of fusobacterium was observed in the faecal microbiota of c parvum-infected animals diarrhoea severity increased in accordance with the abundance of c parvum and fusobacterium moreover the specific increase of fusobacterium appeared to be a universal feature of c parvum infection since neonatal calves from geographically separated areas showed the same result these observations indicated that the growth of fusobacterium may be an important aggravating factor of cryptosporidiosis
many rna viruses arise from animal reservoirs namely bats rodents and insectivores but mechanisms of virus maintenance and transmission still need to be addressed the bicolored white-toothed shrew crocidura leucodon has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic borna disease virus 1 bodv-1 six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with bodv-1 all shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews interestingly all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction infectious virus and viral rna were demonstrated in saliva urine skin swabs lacrimal fluid and faeces both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity the various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep naturally bodv-1infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems
replicating recombinant vector vaccines consist of a fully competent viral vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene from the perspective of viral replication the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be detrimental thus vaccine revertants that delete or inactivate the transgene may evolve to dominate the vaccine virus population both during the process of manufacture of the vaccine as well as during the course of host infection a particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicity-the immunity elicited to the transgene we use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity these models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend the immunological consequences are not one complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared even less obvious revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine overall we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated plos computational biology | https//doi
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is a major cause of respiratory disease in both cattle and young children despite the development of vaccines against bovine brsv incomplete protection and exacerbation of subsequent rsv disease have occurred in order to circumvent these problems calves were vaccinated with the nucleocapsid protein known to be a major target of cd8 + t cells in cattle this was performed according to a dna prime-protein boost strategy the results showed that dna vaccination primed a specific t-cell-mediated response as indicated by both a lymphoproliferative response and ifn-␥ production these responses were enhanced after protein boost after challenge mock-vaccinated calves displayed gross pneumonic lesions and viral replication in the lungs in contrast calves vaccinated by successive administrations of plasmid dna and protein exhibited protection against the development of pneumonic lesions and the viral replication in the bal fluids and the lungs the protection correlated to the cell-mediated immunity and not to the antibody response
we previously showed that an intraperitoneal infection with mouse hepatitis virus mhv persists in interferon-g ifn-g-deficient c57bl/6 b6-gko mice and results in subacute fatal peritonitis which bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis to examine the role of other host factors in mhv infection in mice ifn-g-deficient mice with a balb/c background balb-gko were infected intraperitoneally with mhv and compared with b6-gko mice in contrast to b6-gko mice balb-gko mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure the viral titer of the liver in balb-gko mice was significantly higher than that in b6-gko mice all hepatocytes in balb-gko mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected b6-gko mice the serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected balb-gko mice were higher than that of b6-gko mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice administration of exogenous ifn-g to balb-gko partially inhibited the acute death these results indicate that balb-gko and b6-gko mice clearly show different diseases following mhv infection although wild type counterparts of both mice apparently showed the same clinical course after mhv infection
a total of 446 serum samples from 88 herds in korea were examined for antibody to porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv using blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa all serum samples were collected from 24-to 26-week-old finishing pigs between december 1998 and june 1999 by elisa 237 out of 446 sera tested 53.1% and 54 out of 88 sampled herds 61.3% were positive against prcv of 446 sera from 88 herd tested 185 41.5% serum samples from 22 25% herds were seronegative against prcv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection our data suggested that seropositive herds for prcv are distributed diffusely throughout south korea #
a novel herpesvirus was detected in a captive mob of eastern grey kangaroos macropus giganteus during diagnostic workup for individuals with ulcerative cloacitis virus was initially detected in tissues using a consensus herpesvirus pcr no viral inclusions or particles had been evident in routine histologic or transmission electron microscopic sections of cloacal lesions virus was isolated from samples and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically consistent with a herpesvirus nucleotide sequencing of the pcr product from tissue samples and from the isolates revealed that the virus was in the subfamily gammaherpesvirinae and was distinct from other known herpesviruses the correlation between the lesions and the novel virus remains unknown two herpesviruses both in the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae have previously been described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease this is the first reported gammaherpesvirus within the order marsupialia and may provide valuable information regarding the evolution and phylogeny of this virus family based on current herpesvirus nomenclature convention the authors propose the novel herpesvirus be named macropodid herpesvirus 3 mahv-3 #
feline immunode¢ciency virus and puma lentivirus in florida panthers puma concolor coryi epidemiology and diagnostic issues veterinary research communications 303 307^317abstract this study documents the seroprevalence of feline immunode¢ciency virus fiv and puma lentivirus plv in free-ranging and captive florida panthers puma concolor coryi n = 51 and translocated texas cougars p concolor stanleyana n = 10 from 1985 to 1998 the sera were tested for anti-fiv antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and western blot tests the elisas were read kinetically kela and the sera were retrospectively examined by plv peptide elisa eleven panthers and one cougar were positive by kela 4 panthers and 4 cougars were equivocal 35 panthers and 5 cougars were negative and 1 panther had no data seven of the 11 kela-positive panthers were also positive by western blot tests and all but one were positive by plv peptide elisa ten kelanegative and western blot-negative cats were positive by plv peptide elisa kela results varied within cats from one sample period to the next but plv peptide elisa results were consistent territorial sympatry and mating behaviour noted from radiotelemetry location data on the cats may have contributed to viral transmission between seropositive animals these ¢ndings suggest that florida panthers and the introduced texas cougars have been exposed to fiv and/or plv
in this study the performance of 10 serological assays for the diagnosis of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was evaluated a total of 145 sera from 120 patients were tested they were obtained from patients who were serologically positive for m pneumoniae infection as well as from patients who were infected with microorganisms that may cause interstitial pneumonia the following assays were utilized seromp igm and igg seromp recombinant igm iga and igg liaison m pneumoniae igm and igg and m pneumoniae igm iga and igg elisa medac the seromp recombinant and liaison assays both showed low igm specificity and crossreactivity was mainly observed in groups of patients with acute cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus infections for iga the medac assay was less specific than the seromp recombinant assay discrepancies between the four tests were observed in igg analyses and due to the lack of a gold standard 22 results were removed prior to determining the sensitivity and specificity therefore the overall performance of igg assays may be overstated nevertheless the seromp assay demonstrated a lack of sensitivity the seroprevalence of igg appears to be very low raising concerns regarding whether the serological techniques can detect igg levels over time serology remains a biological tool of choice for diagnosing m pneumoniae infection but improvement and standardization of the assays are needed particularly for the determination of igg
foot-and-mouth disease fmd is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals and can cause severe economic loss interferon-induced transmembrane ifitm proteins constitute a family of viral restriction factors that can inhibit the replication of several types of viruses our previous study showed that overexpression of swine ifitm3 sifitm3 impeded replication of the fmd virus fmdv in bhk-21 cells and mice in this study sifitm3-transgenic tg pigs were produced by handmade cloning results showed that sifitm3 was highly overexpressed in many organs of sifitm3-tg pigs compared to wildtype pigs after a virulent fmdv strain o/es/2001 was intramuscularly inoculated the sifitm3-tg pigs showed slightly higher susceptibility to fmdv infection than wild-type pigs both groups displayed comparable degrees of clinical symptoms throughout the 14-day observation period therefore the induction of systemic sifitm3 expression does not protect pigs against fmdv infection based on these observations we propose that a combination of interferons and vaccines be used to control fmdv infections and subsequent fmd outbreaks
a long-established epidemic of enteritis caused by an unidentified pathogen distinct from parvovirus has now been recognized in mink in 2013 we identified a novel circovirus by degenerate pcr and fully sequenced its genome this virus differs substantially from currently known members of the genus circovirus and represents a new species
almost all commercial poultry are vaccinated against avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv using live attenuated vaccines mass administered by spray at day of hatch although many different types of ibv vaccines are used successfully the arkdpi serotype vaccine when applied by spray does not infect and replicate sufficiently to provide protection against homologous challenge in this study we examined a different ark vaccine strain ark99 which is no longer used commercially due to its reactivity in one day old chicks to determine if it could be further attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs but still provide adequate protection further attenuation of the ark99 vaccine was achieved by passage in embryonated eggs but arkga p1 p20 and p40 designated arkga after p1 were still too reactive to be suitable vaccine candidates however arkga p60 when given by spray had little or no vaccine reaction in one day old broiler chicks and it induced protection from clinical signs and ciliostasis following homologous challenge in addition vaccinated and challenged birds had significantly less challenge virus an important measure of protection compared to non-vaccinated and challenged controls the full-length genomes of viruses from egg passages 1 20 40 and 60 were sequenced using the illumina platform and the data showed single nucleotide polymorphisms snps had accumulated in regions of the genome associated with viral replication pathogenicity and cell tropism arkga p60 accumulated the most snps in key genes associated with pathogenicity polyprotein gene 1ab and cell tropism spike gene compared to previous passages which likely resulted in its more attenuated phenotype these results indicate that the arkga p60 vaccine is safe for spray vaccination of broiler chicks and induces suitable protection against challenge with pathogenic ark-type virus
although rabies virus is widely distributed in the world and has been the subject of extensive investigations with the objective of its ultimate prevention control and management there is much less knowledge of the characteristics distribution and infectivity of other lyssaviruses since bats are known animal vectors for all but one of the known lyssavirus genotypes we have performed an extensive survey of bats in the guangxi province to provide information on lyssavirus distribution in southern china the lyssavirus nucleoprotein gene was detected in brains of 2.86 % of 2969 bats nucleotide sequence homologies among isolates were 86.9-99.6 % but only 70.0-85.0 % for lyssaviruses in genbank these infected bats were detected from a wide area essentially forming a band running from the south-west to the north-east of guangxi and it appears that infection by new lyssaviruses is widespread in this region
samples 310 from rural african children with diarrhea and 122 from controls were analysed for the presence of enteric viruses known to be associated with diarrhea group a rotavirus elisa indicated 12.9% positivity among patients and 2.5% positivity among controls only 23 of the 43 rotavirus elisa-positive stools were also positive by electron microscopy nine children three of whom were controls were found to be shedding coronavirus-like particles detected by electron microscopy stools from all but one of the nine children had been taken within 1 month of each other dot-blot hybridization tests for the presence of ad40 or ad41 dna revealed 44 positive stools 41 of which were from patients 13.2% positivity only three of the ad40-or ad41-positive stools by dna hybridization were positive by electron microscopy and only these three strains could be grown in semipermissive chang conjunctival cells and their identity checked by restriction enzyme analysis further attempts to rescue the other strains using a helper virus failed but nine of the stools proved positive by elsa using a subgroup f-specific monoclonal antibody on the basis of the dna hybridization results alone subgroup f adenoviruses were encountered as frequently as rotavirus in the study and were significantly associated with diarrhea although the viability and intactness of virus particles by the time of laboratory analysis appeared to be very low
infectious bronchitis virus ibv the first coronavirus described was initially associated with severe respiratory disease however outbreaks have more recently also been associated with nephropathogenesis topographically interrelated antigenic determinants of the nephropathogenic gray strain of ibv were characterized using eleven monoclonal antibodies mabs four mabs igg 2a~c defined epitopes that were both conformation-independent and group specific reacting with gray arkansas ark and massachusetts41 mass41 strains seven mabs igg 1~ defined conformation-dependent epitopes that could differentiate the gray from the ark and mass strains the spike protein specificity of the mabs was determined with the conformation-independent mabs and one mab that reacted only in "non-denaturing" western blot assays competitive binding studies using these mabs suggested a high degree of functional dependency among the associated epitopes as might be expected with a protein of complex secondary and tertiary structure at least two regions associated with complete protection of infected embryos were identified that consisted of both conformation-dependent and independent epitopes however a "non-neutralizing" mab which did not protect the embryo from gross lesions did inhibit virus-induced lesions and replication in the kidneys these mabs should be valuable tools in studying ibv pathogenesis
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a major gastrointestinal disease afflicting suckling pigs that causes huge industrial economic losses in this study we investigated microbiota from the colonic mucosa and content in healthy and ped piglets high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed to identify inter-group differences firmicutes fusobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the top four affected phyla the proportion of proteobacteria was higher in infected than in healthy piglets and the opposite was observed for bacteroidetes more than four-fold higher in the healthy group in the infected group fusobacterium accounted for 36.56% and 21.61% in the colonic mucosa and contents respectively while in the healthy group they comprised 22.53% and 12.67% respectively the percentage of lactobacillus in healthy colons 15.63% was considerably higher than that in the disease group <10%. in both the colonic mucosa and contents functional enrichment differed significantly between healthy and diseased groups overall infection with the ped virus increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the colons of piglets targeting intestinal microbiota could be a promising method for ped prevention thus opening new avenues for future research
despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of rsv-associated disease but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection in contrast the role of memory cd8 t cells in protecting against a secondary rsv infection is less established we recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory cd8 t cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following rsv infection but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by ifn-γ to evaluate the ability of rsv-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory cd8 t cell-mediated immunopathology mice with high-magnitude memory cd8 t cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to rsv challenge neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following rsv challenge compared with igg-treated controls neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication which caused a substantial reduction in memory cd8 t cell activation and ifn-γ production directly resulting in survival in contrast therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity mortality or ifn-γ levels despite significantly reducing lung viral titers therefore only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory cd8 t cell-mediated immunopathology following rsv infection overall our results have important implications for the development of future rsv vaccines mucosal immunology 2020 13507-517 https//doi
the evolution of influenza viruses is remarkably dynamic influenza viruses evolve rapidly in sequence and undergo frequent reassortment of different gene segments homologous recombination although commonly seen as an important component of dynamic genome evolution in many other organisms is believed to be rare in influenza in this study 256 gene segments from 32 influenza a genomes were examined for homologous recombination three recombinant h1n1 strains were detected and they most likely resulted from one recombination event between two closely rated parental sequences these findings suggest that homologous recombination in influenza viruses tends to take place between strains sharing high sequence similarity the three recombinant strains were isolated at different time periods and they form a clade indicating that recombinant strains could circulate in addition the simulation results showed that many recombinant sequences might not be detectable by currently existing recombinant detection programs when the parental sequences are of high sequence similarity finally possible ways were discussed to improve the accuracy of the detection for recombinant sequences in influenza
neospora caninum is widely distributed in the world and this parasite is one of the major causes of abortion in cattle dogs and coyotes are definitive hosts of n caninum and several species of domestic and wild animals are intermediate hosts dogs can become infected by the ingestion of tissues containing cysts and then excrete oocysts it is not yet known whether sporulated oocysts are able to induce a patent infection in dogs i e a shedding of n caninum oocysts in feces the objective of this study was to experimentally examine the infection of dogs by sporulated oocysts the oocysts used in the experiment were obtained by feeding dogs with brain of buffaloes bubalus bubalis positive for anti-n caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test ifat ≥200 oocysts shed by these dogs were confirmed to be n caninum by molecular methods and by bioassay in gerbils and sporulated n caninum oocysts were used for the oral infection of four dogs the dogs were 8 weeks old and negative for antibodies to n caninum and toxoplasma gondii dogs 1 and 4 received an inoculum of 10000 sporulated oocysts each dog 2 an inoculum of 5000 sporulated oocysts and dog 3 received 1000 sporulated oocysts of n caninum the total feces excreted by these dogs were collected and examined daily for a period of 30 days no oocysts were found in their feces the dogs were monitored monthly for a 6-month period to observe a possible seroconversion and when this occurred the animals were eliminated from the experiment dogs 1 and 4 seroconverted 1 month after the infection with titer in the ifat of 1600 and 800 respectively the other two dogs presented no seroconvertion during the 6-month period dogs 1 and 2 were euthanized 180 days after infection and were examined for the detection of n caninum in tissues brain muscle lymph node liver lung heart and bone marrow by immunohistochemistry and pcr with negative results in both techniques bioassay in gerbils with brain of these dogs was also performed and again the results were negative in conclusion dogs infected with sporulated oocysts of n caninum were not able to shed oocysts in feces however a higher dose of infection stimulated the production of antibodies against n caninum in the dogs
various viruses can be considered as one of the most frequent causes of human diseases from mild illnesses to really serious sicknesses that end fatally numerous viruses are also pathogenic to animals and plants and many of them mutating become pathogenic also to humans several cases of affecting humans by originally animal viruses have been confirmed viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans the increase of which is caused by general immunosuppression of the world population changes in climate and overall globalization in spite of the fact that the pharmaceutical industry pays great attention to human viral infections many of clinically used antivirals demonstrate also increased toxicity against human cells limited bioavailability and thus not entirely suitable therapeutic profile in addition due to resistance a combination of antivirals is needed for life-threatening infections thus the development of new antiviral agents is of great importance for the control of virus spread on the other hand the discovery and development of structurally new antivirals represent risks therefore another strategy is being developed namely the reformulation of existing antivirals into nanoformulations and investigation of various metal and metalloid nanoparticles with respect to their diagnostic prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral applications this chapter is focused on nanoscale materials/formulations with the potential to be used for the treatment or inhibition of the spread of viral diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus influenza a viruses subtypes h3n2 and h1n1 avian influenza and swine influenza viruses respiratory syncytial virus herpes simplex virus hepatitis b and c viruses ebola and marburg viruses newcastle disease virus dengue and zika viruses and pseudorabies virus effective antiviral long-lasting and target-selective nanoformulations developed for oral intravenous intramuscular intranasal intrarectal intravaginal and intradermal applications are discussed benefits of nanoparticle-based vaccination formulations with the potential to secure cross protection against divergent viruses are outlined as well
a serological survey for avian infectious bronchitis virus and newcastle disease virus antibodies in backyard free-range village chickens in mexico the commercial £ocks in yucatan mexico are free of newcastle disease virus ndv in its velogenic viscerotropic form but little is known about the disease status of backyard poultry a seroprevalence survey in 30 villages using haemagglutination inhibition hi tests for infectious bronchitis virus ibv and ndv antibodies was carried out from december 1997 to june 1998 the seroprevalences were 56.5% 95% ci 50^63% for ibv and 2.2% 95% ci 0.5^3.8% for ndv all the villages had chickens that were positive for antibodies to ibv and nine of the villages had chickens that were positive for antibodies to ndv this suggests that ibv may be responsible for a large proportion of the respiratory disease observed in backyard chickens in yucatan the implications of these ¢ndings are discussed including the highly susceptible status of the backyard chickens in yucatan to ndv and the possibility of this virus being one cause of the syndrome known as mortandad by the local people
a new coronavirus sars-cov is the aetiological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars because of the critical role played by serological assays for sars diagnosis an in-house elisa based on sars-cov recombinant antigens was developed the sars-cov nucleocapsid protein n three n fragments n1 n2 and n3 and the intraviral domain of the membrane protein m2 were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins six reference sera from sars patients were used to detect virus-specific igg in an elisa using each recombinant protein as coating antigen high-titre positive reactions were detected in all sars positive sera the specificity of the assay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non-sars low-tract respiratory infections specific hyper-immune sera to sars-cov and the recombinant proteins n n1 n2 n3 and m2 were also generated in mice and rabbits the specificity of these sera was confirmed by an immunocytochemical assay on biochips of sars-cov infected and uninfected cells
c57 strain mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with denatured mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 particles and virus surface projection membrane and ribonucleoprotein subeomponents obtained from detergent treated purified virus preparations all immunised animals developed high levels of serum antibody directed against the respective antigens detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay mice that had been immunised with denatured virus particles or surface projections were protected against infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 whereas immunisation with virus membrane or ribonucleoprotein subcomponents failed to protect mice against virus challenge
a veterinarian became infected with hendra virus hev after managing a terminally ill horse and performing a limited autopsy with inadequate precautions although she was initially only mildly ill serological tests suggested latent hev infection nevertheless she remains well 2 years after her initial illness recently emerged zoonotic viruses such as hev necessitate appropriate working procedures and personal protective equipment in veterinary practice
the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex mhc are classical examples for high levels of genetic diversity and non-neutral evolution this is particularly true for the regions containing the antigen-binding sites as for instance in the exon 2 of the mhc class ii gene drb we surveyed for the first time in the order chiroptera the genetic diversity within this exon in the sac-winged bat saccopteryx bilineata we detected 11 alleles among 85 bats of which 79 were sampled in one population pairwise comparisons revealed that interallelic sequence differences ranged between 3 and 22% although nucleotide substitutions were not evenly distributed along the exon sequence this was most probably the result of intragenic recombination high levels of sequence divergence and significantly more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions d n /d s 41 suggest long-term balancing selection thus the data are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination gives rise to new alleles at the drb locus of the sac-winged bat and these are maintained in the population through balancing selection in this respect the sac-winged bat closely resembles other mammalian species
cellular restriction factors which render cells intrinsically resistant to viruses potentially impose genetic barriers to crossspecies transmission and emergence of viral pathogens in nature one such factor is apobec3g to overcome apobec3gmediated restriction many lentiviruses encode vif a protein that targets apobec3g for degradation as with many restriction factor genes primate apobec3g displays strong signatures of positive selection this is interpreted as evidence that the primate apobec3g locus reflects a long-term evolutionary ''arms-race'' between retroviruses and their primate hosts here we provide direct evidence that apobec3g has functioned as a barrier to cross-species transmission selecting for viral resistance during emergence of the aids-causing pathogen sivmac in captive colonies of asian macaques in the 1970s specifically we found that rhesus macaques have multiple functionally distinct apobec3g alleles and that emergence of sivmac and simian aids required adaptation of the virus to evade apobec3g-mediated restriction our evidence includes the first comparative analysis of apobec3g polymorphism and function in both a reservoir and recipient host species sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques respectively and identification of adaptations unique to vif proteins of the sivmac lineage that specifically antagonize rhesus apobec3g alleles by demonstrating that interspecies variation in a known restriction factor selected for viral counter-adaptations in the context of a documented case of cross-species transmission our results lend strong support to the evolutionary ''arms-race'' hypothesis importantly our study confirms that apobec3g divergence can be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses including viruses with the potential to infect and spread in human populations citation krupp a mccarthy kr ooms m letko m morgan js et al 2013 apobec3g polymorphism as a selective barrier to cross-species transmission and emergence of pathogenic siv and aids in a primate host plos pathog 910 e1003641
background-recently several new human coronaviruses have been identified study design-a recombinant protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on portions of the nucleocapsid protein of group i human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults hcov-229e the percentages of seropositive individuals were 57.1% for infants < 2 months old 38.9% for infants 2-3 months old 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old 42.9-50.0% for infants 6-12 months old and 34.8-62.5% for individuals 1-20 years old for hcov-nl63 the percentages of seropositive individuals were 45.2% for infants < 2 months old 11.1% for infants 2-3 months old 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old 28.6-40.0% for infants 6-12 months old and 25.0-70.3% for individuals 1-20 years old conclusions-infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year
viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results our data suggest that rspv-st is potentially an effective vaccine against infection with emerging pedv strains
acute gastroenteritis is one of the main causes of mortality in humans and young animals domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geo-
viruses of lower vertebrates recently became a ®eld of interest to the public due to increasing epizootics and economic losses of poikilothermic animals these were reported worldwide from both wildlife and collections of aquatic poikilothermic animals several rna and dna viruses infecting ®sh amphibians and reptiles have been studied intensively during the last 20 years many of these viruses induce diseases resulting in important economic losses of lower vertebrates especially in ®sh aquaculture in addition some of the dna viruses seem to be emerging pathogens involved in the worldwide decline in wildlife 3irido- herpes-and polyomavirus infections may be involved in the reduction in the numbers of endangered amphibian and reptile species in this context the knowledge of several important rna viruses such as orthomyxo- paramyxo- rhabdo- retro- corona- calici- toga- picorna- noda- reo-and birnaviruses and dna viruses such as parvo- irido- herpes- adeno- polyoma-and poxviruses is described in this review
next-generation vaccines that utilize t cells could potentially overcome the limitations of current influenza vaccines that rely on antibodies to provide narrow subtype-specific protection and are prone to antigenic mismatch with circulating strains evidence from animal models shows that t cells can provide heterosubtypic protection and are crucial for immune control of influenza virus infections this has provided hope for the design of a universal vaccine able to prime against diverse influenza virus strains and subtypes however multiple hurdles exist for the realisation of a universal t cell vaccine overall primary concerns are extrapolating human clinical studies seeding durable effective t cell resident memory trm population human leucocyte antigen hla coverage and the potential for t cell-mediated immune escape further comprehensive human clinical data is needed during natural infection to validate the protective role t cells play during infection in the absence of antibodies furthermore fundamental questions still exist regarding the site longevity and duration quantity and phenotype of t cells needed for optimal protection standardised experimental methods and eventually simplified commercial assays to assess peripheral influenza-specific t cell responses are needed for larger-scale clinical studies of t cells as a correlate of protection against influenza infection the design and implementation of a t cell-inducing vaccine will require a consensus on the level of protection acceptable in the community which may not provide sterilizing immunity but could protect the individual from severe disease reduce the length of infection and potentially reduce transmission in the community therefore increasing the standard of care potentially offered by t cell vaccines should be considered in the context of pandemic preparedness and zoonotic infections and in combination with improved antibody vaccine targeting methods current pandemic vaccine preparedness measures and ongoing clinical trials under-utilise t cell-inducing vaccines reflecting the myriad questions that remain about how when where and which t cells are needed to fight influenza virus infection this review aims to bring together basic fundamentals of t cell biology with human clinical data which need to be considered for the implementation of a universal vaccine against influenza that harnesses the power of t cells
the human gut microbiota has been the interest of extensive research in recent years and our knowledge on using the potential capacity of these microbes are growing rapidly microorganisms colonized throughout the gastrointestinal tract of human are coevolved through symbiotic relationship and can influence physiology metabolism nutrition and immune functions of an individual the gut microbes are directly involved in conferring protection against pathogen colonization by inducing direct killing competing with nutrients and enhancing the response of the gut-associated immune repertoire damage in the microbiome dysbiosis is linked with several life-threatening outcomes viz inflammatory bowel disease cancer obesity allergy and auto-immune disorders therefore the manipulation of human gut microbiota came out as a potential choice for therapeutic intervention of the several human diseases herein we review significant studies emphasizing the influence of the gut microbiota on the regulation of host responses in combating infectious and inflammatory diseases alongside describing the promises of gut microbes as future therapeutics
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv induces a weak immune response enabling it to persist in different organs of infected pigs this has been attributed to the ability of prrsv to influence the induction of cytokine responses in this study we investigated the cytokine transcriptional profiles in different compartments of the mediastinal lymph node of pigs infected with three genotype 1 prrsv strains of differing pathogenicity the low virulence prototype lelystad virus lv and uk field strain 215-06 and the highly virulent subtype 3 su1-bel isolate from belarus we have used a combination of laser capture micro-dissection lcm followed by real time quantitative pcr rt-qpcr and immunohistochemical ihc detection of immune cell markers cd3 cd79a and mac387 and rt-qpcr quantification of prrsv and cytokine transcripts compared to mock infected pigs we found a significant downregulation of tnf-α and ifn-α in follicular and interfollicular areas of the mediastinal lymph node from 3 days post-infection dpi in animals infected with all three strains this was accompanied by a transient b cell depletion and t cell and macrophage infiltration in the follicles together with t cell depletion in the interfollicular areas a delayed upregulation of ifn-γ and
canine influenza virus civ subtype h3n2 is a newly identified highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes cough pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms in dogs data indicate that the virus is responsible for recent clinical cases of dog disease in china however therapeutic options for this disease are very limited in this study seven monoclonal antibodies mabs against civ js/10 an h3n2 subtype virus were produced and characterized among them mab d7 which is specific for the ha2 glycopeptide gp induced the highest neutralization titers the protection provided by mab d7 was evaluated in balb/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of h3n2 influenza virus including two strains of civ and one strain of swine influenza virus siv the data show that mab d7 protected the mice from infection with the three viral strains especially the homologous strain which was indicated by the recovery of body weight reduction of viral load and reduction of tissue damage moreover the levels of ifn-γ and tnf-α in the lungs as detected by elisa were reduced in the infected mice treated with the mab d7 compared with those without mab d7 treatment thus our findings demonstrate for the first time that a mab could reduce the release of ifn-γ and tnf-α associated with tissue damage by civ infection and that the mab might be of great therapeutic value for civ infection
foot-and-mouth disease viruses were isolated from cells infected with a mixture of temperature-sensitive fs mutants belonging to different subtype strains in order to select for recombination events in many different regions of the genome crosses were performed between various pairs of mutants with ts mutations in different regions of the genome ts+ progeny were analysed by electrofocusing virus-induced proteins and rnase t fingerprinting of their rna all but 5 out of 43 independent isolates from nine crosses proved to have recombinant rna genomes maps of these genomes based on a knowledge of the locations of the unique oligonucleotides were constructed most could be interpreted as being the products of single genetic cross-overs although three recombinants were formed by two cross-overs each cross-overs in at least twelve distinct regions of the genome were identified this evidence of a large number of recombination sites suggests that rna recombination in picornaviruses is a general as opposed to a site-specific phenomenon picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus recombination rna fingerprint
this report describes five cases of naturally occurring feline coronavirus enteritis the affected animals aged 2 months to 7 years had a clinical history of intestinal symptoms including diarrhoea or vomiting or both they exhibited variable histological changes in the epithelium of the small intestine ranging from degeneration of single cells and detachment of groups of cells from the villous tips to regenerative processes of the crypt epithelia post-mortem diagnosis was based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen within intestinal epithelial cells and on the electron microscopical demonstration of coronavirus particles in the faeces in addition one animal was immunohistochemically positive for antigens of feline leukaemia virus felv and exhibited intestinal changes consistent with felvassociated enteritis two cats were tested serologically for feline immunodeficiency antibodies with negative results the findings indicate that natural coronavirus infection is a potential cause of severe enteritis in juvenile and adult cats
arboviruses are often maintained in complex cycles involving vertebrates such as mammals or birds and blood-feeding mosquitoes however the role of wildlife hosts in their emergence or re-emergence in human populations has received little attention the recent emergence of zika virus in america and previous occurrences of chikungunya and dengue forces us to confront a potential new disease-emergence phenomenon using a spatial data mining framework to identify potential biotic interactions based on the degree of co-occurrence between different species we identified those mammal species with the highest potential for establishing mammal-vector interactions considering as principal vector aedes aegypti seven of the top ten identified mammal species with highest potential were bats with two of them having previously been confirmed as positive hosts for dengue in mexico we hope that this will raise interest of mexican public health authorities and academic institutions to assess the role of wild hosts in the maintenance and spread of arboviruses
a double-inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus sars-cov was developed and manufactured at large scale using fermenter cultures of serum protein free vero cells a two step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and u v inactivation was utilised in order to ensure an extremely high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity the immunogenicity of this double-inactivated vaccine was characterised in the mouse model mice that were immunised twice with the candidate sars-cov vaccine developed high antibody titres against the sars-cov spike protein and high levels of neutralising antibodies the use of the adjuvant aloh 3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in addition cell mediated immunity as measured by interferon-␥ and interleukin-4 stimulation was elicited by vaccination moreover the vaccine confers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with sars-cov protection of mice was correlated to antibody titre against the sars-cov s protein and neutralising antibody titre
a large quantity of sars-cov virus was proliferated in vero cells inactivated with -propiolactone then purified by sepharose 4ff column chromatography to prepare inactivated vaccine the vaccine was identified by western blot mass spectrographic analysis elisa and electron microscopy the vaccine with or without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was inoculated into female balb/c mice at different dosages the result showed that the antibodies to sars-cov were induced in the mice the antibody levels induced by the vaccine with aluminum hydroxide were higher than those without aluminum hydroxide

clostridium difficile toxins were associated with calf diarrhea in a recent retrospective study however no causal relationship has been prospectively investigated this infection study tested whether the oral inoculation of neonatal calves with a toxigenic strain of c difficile pcr-ribotype 077 results in enteric disease fourteen 6-24 h old male colostrums-fed holstein calves received either three doses of c difficile 1.4 â 10 8 ae 3.5 â 10 8 cfu n = 8 or sterile culture broth n = 6 calves were euthanized on day 6 or after the onset of diarrhea whichever came first fecal and intestinal samples were blindly cultured for c difficile and tested for its toxin a/b c difficile tox a/b ii elisa techlab pcr-ribotyping was used to compare inoculated and recovered isolates diarrhea was observed in all control calves and 3/8 of inoculated calves p = 0.03 but it did not occur in calves that tested positive for c difficile toxins fecal toxins were identified only from two controls pcr-ribotyping confirmed the presence of c difficile pcr-ribotype 077 in samples of all inoculated calves but not from controls the identification of five other pcrribotypes in 3/8 37.5% and 2/6 33.3% of inoculated and control calves respectively indicated early natural infection 24 h of age five of 14 cecal samples had c difficile p = 0.01 in conclusion the oral administration of c difficile pcr-ribotype 077 to neonatal calves resulted in fecal/intestinal colonization but not in detection of toxins or signs of enteric disease further studies are required to investigate the clinical relevance of c difficile in calves crown
the pathogenesis of giii.2 bovine norovirus bonov is not well understood our study demonstrated persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding but with a lack of significant intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic gn calves infected with giii.2 bonov cv186-oh/00/us strain nine 4 to 7-day-old angus/jersey crossbred gn calves were orally inoculated with 10.0-11.9 log 10 genomic equivalents ge/calf of cv186-oh n=7 or mock n=2 calves were euthanized at post-inoculation day pid 1 n=1 when moderate to severe lethargy was observed and at pids 2-6 n=4 after lethargy had subsided two calves were kept longer term until pid 30 for monitoring fecal shedding patterns by taqman real-time rt-pcr qrt-pcr most infected calves exhibited two clinical signs i acute but persisting diarrhea and ii acute moderate to severe lethargy the two infected calves followed longer-term had prolonged fecal viral rna shedding at least until pid 20 by qrt-pcr 5 infected calves had low viral rna titers in serum ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 log 10 ge/ml at pids 1-5 but not <2.7 log 10 ge/ml at pids 6-30 the latter observation coincided with the presence of serum igg antibody to bonov at pids 8-30 collectively the giii.2 bonov strain cv186-oh induced only mild enteropathogenicity evident by the lack of significant intestinal lesions but it led to persisting mild diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding in gn calves the prolonged fecal shedding of giii.2 bonov might partially explain how this virus is maintained as endemic infections in cattle
background gray wolves canis lupus were reintroduced into yellowstone national park ynp after a .70 year absence and as part of recovery efforts the population has been closely monitored in 1999 and 2005 pup survival was significantly reduced suggestive of disease outbreaks methodology/principal findings we analyzed sympatric wolf coyote canis latrans and red fox vulpes vulpes serologic data from ynp spanning 1991-2007 to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure identify associated risk factors and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data we found high constant exposure to canine parvovirus wolf seroprevalence 100% coyote 94% canine adenovirus-1 wolf pups 91% adults 96% coyote juveniles 18% adults 83% and canine herpesvirus wolf 87% coyote juveniles 23% young adults 51% old adults 87% suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within ynp wolves and coyotes an average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite neospora caninum although individuals' odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable wolf coyote and fox exposure to canine distemper virus cdv was temporally variable with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005 and perhaps a smaller isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of ynp in 2002 the years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in cdv seroprevalence suggesting that cdv contributed to the observed mortality conclusions/significance of the pathogens we examined none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in ynp however cdv appears capable of causing short-term population declines additional information on how and where cdv is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the northern rocky mountain wolf population
canine parvovirus cpv is an important pathogen in domestic dogs and the original antigenic types cpv-2 and its variants cpv-2a 2b and 2c are prevalent worldwide a multiplex taqman real-time pcr method was developed for the detection and differentiation of four antigenic types of cpv a set of primers and probes cpv-305f/cpv-305r and cpv-2-305p for cpv-2/cpv-2a-305p for cpv-2a 2b and 2c was able to differentiate cpv-2 and its variants cpv-2a 2b and 2c another set of primers and probes cpv-426f/cpv-426r and cpv-2-426p for cpv-2 and 2a/cpv-2b-426p for cpv-2b/cpv-2c-426p for cpv-2c was able to differentiate cpv-2a 2 cpv-2b and cpv-2c with these primers and probes the multiplex taqman real-time pcr assay detected effectively and differentiated cpv-2 2a 2b and 2c by two separate real-time pcrs no cross reactivity was observed with canine distemper virus canine adenovirus and canine coronavirus the detection limit of the assay is 10 1 genome copies/μl for cpv-2 cpv-2a cpv-2b and 10 2 copies/μl for cpv-2c the multiplex realtime pcr has 100% agreement with dna sequencing we provide a sensitive assay that simultaneously detects and differentiate four antigenic types of cpv and the method was also used for quantification of cpvs viral genome
one cross-sectional study describing the clinicopathologic abnormalities in 24 dogs seropositive to bartonella vinsonii ssp berkhoffi was identified three of 4 anemic dogs tested were coombs'-positive 1 yielding an ime value of 3.81 bartonella spp induce imha is low as the range of pathogenesis for this organism is still emerging further prospective controlled studies are needed to address this question borrelia spp one retrospective study described 1 dog with imha that was seropositive for b burgdorferi a phagocytophilium and r rickettsii 2 owing to the co-exposure status evidence for b burgdorferi as a cause of imha could not be evaluated in a separate study a coombs'positive anemia was documented in a dog with borrelia turicatae spirochetemia 3 yielding an ime value of 2.37 based on isolated case reports the overall evidence that borrelia spp infection induces imha is negligible considering that borrelia infection in dogs is associated with other immune-mediated conditions notably polyarthritis 4 future prospective
in this study swine fecal specimens n = 251 collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by rt-pcr porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % 33/251 of the samples we demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in kenya and uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs nursing piglets 15 % post-weaning 3-month-old pigs 17 % 4-month-old pigs 10 %. genetic analysis of the partial rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp region 690 nt revealed that kobuviruses circulating in east africa are diverse sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses respectively the nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 % 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 % respectively additionally upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp rt-pcr bands while using the same primer set we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses to our knowledge this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an african region further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies
objectives respiratory syncytial virus rsv causes respiratory infection across the world with infants and the elderly at particular risk of developing severe disease and death the replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus panad3-rsv and modified vaccinia virus ankara mva-rsv vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60-75 years methods we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of mva-rsv given by intramuscular im injection n = 6 two doses of im panad3-rsv given 4-weeks apart n = 6 im panad3-rsv prime and im mva-rsv boost 8-weeks later n = 6 intra-nasal in spray of panad3-rsv prime and im mva-rsv boost 8-weeks later n = 6 or no vaccine n = 6 safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses rsv-and panad3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and seap assays respectively peripheral b-cell immune responses frequencies of f-specific igg and iga antibody secreting cells and memory b-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour elispot assays respectively and peripheral rsv-specific t-cell immune responses frequencies of ifn γ -producing t-cells by ex vivo elispot and cd4 + /cd8 + /tfh-like cell frequencies by ics/facs assay results the vaccines were safe and well tolerated compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum rsv-neutralising antibody appearance and magnitude of f-specific igg and iga ascs and expansion of cd4 + /cd8 + ifn γ -producing t-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose there were little/no iga memory b-cell responses in younger and older adults expansion of ifn γproducing t-cells was most marked in older adults following im prime with balanced cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses the rsv-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of panad3 vector neutralising antibody conclusions panad3-rsv and mva-rsv was safe and immunogenic in older adults and the parallel induction of rsv-specific humoral and cellular immunity merits further assessment in providing protection from severe disease
sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus strain gz50 was partially purified and inactivated with 12000 formaldehyde in cell culture the inactivated virus blocked the replication of live virus by decreasing the tcid 5.0 of the live virus 10 3.6 to 10 4.6 times inactivated gz50 was used to immunize mice intranasally either alone or after precipitation with polyethylene glycol peg or with cpg or ctb as an adjuvant the titer of serum neutralizing antibodies was up to 1640 in mice immunized with adjuvants or peg precipitated gz50 specific iga was detected in tracheal-lung wash fluid by immunofluorescence though serum antibodies were detected no anti-sars-iga could be detected in mice immunized only with inactivated gz50 the roles of adjuvants in intranasal immunization with inactivated sars-cov is discussed
sars-cov infection of human results in antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses however it is critical to determine whether sars-cov-specific memory t cells can persist for long periods of time in this study we analyzed the cellular immune response from 21 sarsrecovered individuals who had been diagnosed with sars in 2003 by using elisa cba elispot and multiparameter flow cytometry assays our results demonstrated that low levels of specific memory t cell responses to sars-cov s m e and n peptides were detected in a correspondence to chang-you wu changyou_wu@yahoo com proportion of sars-recovered patients and ifn-γ was the predominant cytokine produced by t cells after stimulation with peptides cytometry analysis indicated that the majority of memory cd8 + t cells produced ifn-γ whereas memory cd4 + t cells produced ifn-γ il-2 or tnf-α these results might provide valuable information on the cellular immune response in recovered sars-cov patients for the rational design of vaccines against sars-cov infection fan et al
recently identified hantaviruses harbored by shrews and moles order soricomorpha suggest that other mammals having shared ancestry may serve as reservoirs to investigate this possibility archival tissues from 213 insectivorous bats order chiroptera were analyzed for hantavirus rna by rt-pcr following numerous failed attempts hantavirus rna was detected in ethanol-fixed liver tissue from two banana pipistrelles neoromicia nanus captured near mouyassué village in côte d'ivoire west africa in june 2011 phylogenetic analysis of partial l-segment sequences using maximum-likelihood and bayesian methods revealed that the newfound hantavirus designated mouyassué virus mouv was highly divergent and basal to all other rodent-and soricomorph-borne hantaviruses except for nova virus in the european common mole talpa europaea full genome sequencing of mouv and further surveys of other bat species for hantaviruses now underway will provide critical insights into the evolution and diversification of hantaviruses
a total of 332 fecal specimens collected during january-december 2008 from adult patients with diarrhea were screened for group a and c rotaviruses noroviruses gi and gii sapovirus aichi virus human parechovirus enterovirus adenovirus and astrovirus by rt-multiplex pcr the detection rate for diarrheal viruses was 4.2 %. adenovirus and enterovirus were equally detected as the most predominant viruses with prevalence of 1.2 % followed by aichi virus 0.9 % and norovirus gii 0.6 %. mixed infection with norovirus gii and human parechovirus was also detected 0.3 %. this study provides epidemiological data for a wide variety of diarrheal viruses circulating in adult patients with diarrhea in chiang mai thailand

this paper analyzes the main trend of the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids vaccines in recent years designing an hiv-1 vaccine that provides robust protection from hiv-1 infection remains a challenge despite many years of effort therefore we describe the receptor binding domain of gp120 as a target for developing aids vaccines and we recommend some measures that could induce efficiently and produce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies with high binding affinity those measures may offer a new way of the research and development of the potent and broad aids vaccines
bat research networks and viral surveillance are assumed to be at odds due to seemingly conflicting research priorities yet human threats that contribute to declines in bat populations globally also lead to increased transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses which may pose a threat to global health and food security in this review we discuss the importance of and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations between bat research networks and infectious disease experts to tackle shared threats that jeopardize bat conservation as well as human and animal health moreover we assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses globally and demonstrate that western asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research the lack of bat research in western asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region-specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover we detail a regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in western asia i e the western asia bat research network wab-net with the aim of integrating ecological research on bats with virus surveillance to find "win-win" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region
canine respiratory coronavirus crcov is a group ii coronavirus that was firstly identified in lung samples of dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease cird in uk in 2003 we report for the first time the identification of crcov in italy together with serological evidence that the virus has been circulating in the italian dog population as from 2005 serological investigations on 216 dog sera carried out by an elisa test using the strictly related bovine coronavirus bcov as antigen revealed an overall crcov seroprevalence of 32.06% in the last 2 years rt-pcr targeting the s-gene of crcov was carried out on 109 lung samples collected from carcasses of dogs submitted for diagnostic investigations positive results were obtained from the lungs of a dog of the apulia region that was co-infected with canine parvovirus type 2 sequence analysis of the s-gene fragment amplified by rt-pcr 595 bp showed similarity to group ii coronaviruses with the highest nucleotide identity 98% to the only crcov strain currently available in the genbank database strain t101 the results of the present study show that crcov is present also in continental europe although further studies are required to determine the real pathogenic potential of the virus #
bats are important hosts of many viruses and in several cases they may serve as natural reservoirs even for viruses with zoonotic potential worldwide including europe however they also serve as natural reservoir for other virus groups with important evolutionary relevance and yet unknown zoonotic potential we performed viral metagenomic analyses on miniopterus schreibersii bat fecal samples as a result a novel parvovirus was detected for the first time in european bats although bufavirus was recently discovered as a novel human infecting parvovirus here we report sequence data of the first bufavirus from european bats related to human bufaviruses based on our sequence data a possible intragenic recombination event was detected within bufaviruses which may serves as an important milestone in their evolution
although many studies provide strong evidence supporting the development of hcv virus-like particle vlp-based vaccines the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or multiple dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity in this study we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the tlr2 agonist pam 2 cys e 8 pam 2 cys to enhance the immunogenicity of vlps containing the hcv structural proteins core e1 and e2 of genotype 1a while co-formulation of this lipopeptide with vlps only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell dc uptake its ability to concomitantly induce dc maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using vlps alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant alum dramatically improved vlp and e2-specific antibody responses were observed in vlp+e 8 pam 2 cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted vlps was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of vlps formulated with this lipopeptide this result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of vlp+e 8 pam 2 cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of vlps by huh7 cells moreover vaccination of hla-a2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better vlp-specific ifn-c-mediated responses compared to nonadjuvanted vlps but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund's adjuvant these results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of hcv vlps can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to dcs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of hcv

newcastle disease virus ndv an avian virus is being evaluated for the development of vectored human vaccines against emerging pathogens previous studies of ndv-vectored vaccines in a mouse model suggested their potency after delivery by injection or by the intranasal route we compared the efficacy of various routes of delivery of ndv-vectored vaccines in a non-human primate model while delivery of an ndv vectored vaccine by the combined intranasal/intratracheal route elicited protective immune responses delivery by the subcutaneous route or the intranasal route alone elicited limited or no protective immune responses suggesting the necessity for vaccine delivery to the lower respiratory tract furthermore direct comparison of a vaccine based on an ndv mesogenic strain ndv-bc with a similarly designed ndv vector based on a modified lentogenic strain carrying a polybasic f cleavage site ndv-vf suggested that the two ndv strains were similar in immunogenicity and were equally protective
human adenoviral had vectors have demonstrated great potential as vaccine vectors preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of vector design robust antigen expression and protective immunity using this system however clinical use of adenoviral vectors for vaccine purposes is anticipated to be limited by vector immunity that is either preexisting or develops rapidly following the first inoculation with adenoviral vectors vector immunity inactivates the vector particles and rapidly removes the transduced cells thereby limiting the duration of transgene expression due to strong vector immunity subsequent use of the same vector is usually less efficient in order to circumvent this limitation nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been proposed as alternative vectors in addition to eluding had immunity these vectors possess most of the attractive features of had vectors several replication-competent or replication-defective nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been developed and investigated for their potential as vaccine delivery vectors here we review recent advances in the design and characterization of various nonhuman adenoviral vectors and discuss their potential applications for human and animal vaccination
faeces samples from 218 1 to 30-day-old diarrheic dairy calves in 65 dairy herds were screened for the presence of cryptosporidium and concurrent infections with rotavirus coronavirus f5 escherichia coli and salmonella spp calves were grouped according to their age as follows 1±7 8±14 15±21 and 22±30 days cryptosporidium infection was detected in 43.8% 71.9% 63.2% and 6.9% of the calves in the respective age groups significant differences in the detection rate of cryptosporidium were found between the age group 22±30 days and all other age groups and between the age group 1±7 days and the age groups 8±14 days and 15±21 days cryptosporidium was the only enteropathogen detected in 60 of the 114 52.6% diarrheic calves concurrent infections with other enteropathogens were detected in 64.3% 46.3% 39.5% and 0% of the cryptosporidium-infected calves in the age groups 1±7 8±14 15±21 and 22±30 days respectively a significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections p < 0.05 was found the detection rates of the other enteropathogens considered in calves with cryptosporidium infection were 87% for rotavirus 11.1% for coronavirus 27.8% for f5 e coli and 1.8% for salmonella #
the in situ hybridization ish technique was developed to detect the swine coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv in cell culture and tissue sections from tgev-or prcv-infected pigs the 35s-labeled rna probes were generated from two plasmids ppsp fp and ppsp fp containing part of the s gene of tgev the procedure was first standardized in cell cultures the radiolabeled ppsp fp probe detected both tgev and prcv in virus-inoculated cell cultures whereas ppsp fp probe detected tgev but not prcv the probe was then used to detect tgev or prcv in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with tgev or prcv or naturally infected with tgev again the probes detected tgev in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and prcv in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs tgev rna was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and less often within some crypt epithelial cells prcv was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type ii pneumocytes type i pneumocytes alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells respectively ish has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of tgev and prcv in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections
the prevalence of infectious diseases in wild and feral carnivores is poorly known in primorsky krai where rare species such as the amur tiger and the far east leopard roam in this study we evaluated the prevalence of seropositivity in feral cats dogs and wild raccoon dog badger american mink far eastern wild cat carnivores to various pathogens distemper virus parvovirus feline immunodeficiency and feline leukemia virus feline coronavirus toxoplasma gondii mycoplasma sp and chlamydia sp it was shown that seropositivity occurred significantly more frequent in feral animals than in wild ones the highest percentage of seropositive animals was observed in feral dogs it is these diseases that can be dangerous for the amur tiger and the far east leopard thus affecting their populations
reports of rotavirus excretion in calves usually result from cross-sectional studies and in face of the conflicting results regarding protection of calves born to vaccinated dams against diarrhea the aim of the present study was to evaluate rotavirus excretion in dairy calves born to vaccinated or unvaccinated dams to identify the genotypes of bovine rotavirus group a rva strains isolated from these animals as well as to investigate characteristics of the disease in naturally occurring circumstances throughout the first month of life five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves 28 from each farm and in the vaccinated herd 11/281 samples 3.91% taken from six different calves tested positive for rva while in the unvaccinated herd 3/271 samples 1.11% taken from 3 different calves tested positive the genotyping of the vp7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to g6 genotype ncdv strain and for the vp4 gene strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to b223 strain while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to p genotype uk strain genotypes found in this study were g6p in the vaccinated herd and g6p in the unvaccinated herd all calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine g6p and g10p and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure
while influenza viruses are a common respiratory pathogen sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract the ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection however the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood here we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route we found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection h5n1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route virus transmissibility to naïve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation these data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes
the henipaviruses hendra virus hev and nipah virus niv are enigmatic emerging pathogens that causes severe and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease in both animals and humans amongst people case fatality rates range between 40 and 75% and there are no vaccines or treatments approved for human use a number of species of animals including guinea pigs hamsters cats ferrets pigs and african green monkeys have been employed as animal models of human henipavirus infection here we review the development of animal models for henipavirus infection discuss the pathology and pathogenesis of these models and assess the utility of each model to recapitulate important aspects of henipavirus-mediated disease seen in humans

bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and other viruses with zoonotic potential florida has indigenous non-migratory populations of brazilian free-tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis that mostly roost in colonies in artificial structures unlike their counterparts in brazil and mexico the viruses harbored by the florida bats have been underexplored we report the detection of an alphacoronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different t brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health the rdrp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats t brasiliensis and molossus molossus in brazil in common with the experience of others doing similar work attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful we surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region as various coronaviruses covs that affect humans emerged from bats our study raises the question whether covs such as the one detected in our work are yet-to-be-detected pathogens of humans and animals other than bats
the cross-species transmission of viruses from one host species to another is responsible for the majority of emerging infections however it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others if related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies by analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families notably our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies the hepadnaviridae polyomaviridae poxviridae papillomaviridae and adenoviridae all of which possess double-stranded dna genomes exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here at the other extreme the virus and host trees for all the rna viruses studied here particularly the rhabdoviridae and the picornaviridae displayed high levels of topological incongruence indicative of frequent host switching overall we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping
to increase immune responses of plant-based vaccines in intestine mucosal immune systems a synthetic neutralizing epitope scoe gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was fused with m cell-targeting ligand co1 and introduced into a plant expression vector under the control of rice amylase 3d promoter the scoe-co1 fusion gene was introduced into rice calli via the particle bombardment-mediated transformation method the stable integration and transcriptional expression of the scoe-co1 fusion gene was confirmed by genomic dna pcr amplification and northern blot analysis respectively the expression of the coe-co1 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis the highest expression level of the coe-co1 fusion protein reached 0.083 % of the total soluble protein according to quantitative densitometry of western blot analysis mice immunized with transgenic rice calli protein extracts induced significant serum igg and fecal iga antibody levels against purified bacterial coe the systemic and mucosal immune responses were confirmed by measuring coe-specific igg and iga antibody-secreting cells in the lymphocytes extracted from the spleen and coe-specific iga antibody-secreting cells in the peyer's patches from immunized mice these results indicated that oral immunization of plant-produced coe-co1 fusion protein could elicit efficient systemic and mucosal immune responses against the coe antigen key message neutralizing epitope from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-m cell targeting ligand fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli and elicited systemic and mucosal immune responses by oral administration in mice
since it emerged in brazil in may 2015 the mosquito-borne zika virus zikv has raised global concern due to its association with a significant rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly and neurological disorders such as guillain-barré syndrome we developed prototype subunit and adenoviral-based zika vaccines encoding the extracellular portion of the zikv envelope gene e fused to the t4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain efl the subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array mna the immunogenicity of these two vaccines named ad5 zikv-efl and zikv-refl was tested in c57bl/6 mice prime/boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a zikv-specific antibody response which provided neutralizing immunity moreover protection was evaluated in seven-day-old pups after virulent zikv intraperitoneal challenge pups born to mice immunized with ad5 zikv-efl were all protected against lethal challenge infection without weight loss or neurological signs while pups born to dams immunized with mna-zikv-refl were partially protected 50%. no protection was seen in pups born to phosphate buffered saline-immunized mice this study illustrates the preliminary efficacy of the e zikv antigen vaccination in controlling zikv infectivity providing a promising candidate vaccine and antigen format for the prevention of zika virus disease
we evaluated the antigenicity of recombinant infectious bronchitis virus ibv s1 protein expressed in mammalian cells recombinant s1 was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a trimerization motif peptide then purified using ni sepharose the purified protein was analyzed by western blotting mixed with oil adjuvant and administered to 29-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens six weeks after immunization anti-ibv neutralizing titer and anti-s1 elisa titer were determined immunized chickens then were inoculated with ibv via the trachea and ciliary activity was observed results showed that the recombinant s1 protein was highly glycosylated and the neutralizing antigenicity of recombinant s1 protein was lower than that of inactivated virus however anti-s1 elisa indicated that the recombinant s1 protein induced antibodies against s1 these results suggest that the recombinant s1 may retain non-neutralizing epitopes but have unnatural glycosylation pattern and conformation resulting in lacking neutralizing conformational epitopes in conclusion the neutralizing antigenicity of recombinant s1 protein expressed from mammalian cells was decreased and was not sufficient to induce neutralizing antibodies
wild migratory birds are often implicated in the introduction maintenance and global dissemination of different pathogens such as influenza a viruses iav and antimicrobial-resistant amr bacteria trapping of migratory birds during their resting periods at the northern coast of egypt is a common and ancient practice performed mainly for selling in live bird markets lbm in the present study samples were collected from 148 wild birds representing 14 species which were being offered for sale in lbm all birds were tested for the presence of aiv and enterobacteriaceae ten samples collected from northern shoveler birds spatula clypeata were positive for iav and pcr sub-typing and pan ha/na sequencing assays detected h5n8 h9n2 and h6n2 viruses in four four and one birds respectively sequencing of the full haemagglutinin ha gene revealed a high similarity with currently circulating iav in egypt from all the birds e coli was recovered from 37.2% and salmonella from 20.2% with 66-96% and 23-43% isolates being resistant to at least one of seven selected critically important antimicrobials cia respectively the presence of enzootic iav and the wide prevalence of amr enterobacteriaceae in wild birds highlight the potential role of lbm in the spread of different pathogens from and to wild birds continued surveillance of both aiv and antimicrobial-resistant enterobacteriaceae in wild birds' habitats is urgently needed
background the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature and originate from wildlife reservoirs borna disease caused by borna disease virus 1 bodv-1 is an infectious disease affecting mammals but recently it has also been shown to cause fatal encephalitis in humans the endemic character of borna disease points towards a nature-bound reservoir with only one shrew species identified as reservoir host to date bats have been identified as reservoirs of a variety of zoonotic infectious agents endogenous borna-like elements in the genome of certain bat species additionally point towards co-evolution of bats with bornaviruses and therefore raise the question whether bats could serve as a potential reservoir of orthobornaviruses methods frozen brain samples n = 257 of bats of seven different genera from germany were investigated by orthobornaviral rt-pcr additionally tissue slides of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of a subset of these bats n = 140 were investigated for orthobornaviral phosphoprotein by immunohistochemistry results the brain samples were tested by rt-pcr without any evidence of orthobornavirus specific amplicons immunohistochemistry revealed a faint immunoreaction in 3/140 bats but with an untypical staining pattern for viral antigen conclusions rt-pcr-screening showed no evidence for orthobornaviral rna in the investigated bats however immunohistochemistry results should be investigated further to elucidate whether the reaction might be associated with expressed endogenous bornaviral elements or other so far unknown bornaviruses
coronavirus infections are a continuous threat raised time and again with the recent emergence of novel virulent strains these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus ped virus pedv in the absence of effective vaccines infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical early detection and differential diagnosis of pedv infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease therefore there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols no-wash high-throughput immunoassays this study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against pedv under experimental and field conditions using a rapid sensitive luminescent proximity homogenous assay alphalisa pedv igg and iga antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection pedv igg antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure remarkably the serum iga levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study lasting longer than the serum igg response overall alphalisa allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed sensitivity and simplicity of use particularly the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the "time to result" metric of currently available immunoassays
although some previously common infections such as sendai virus and mycoplasma pulmonis have become rare in laboratory rodents in north american research facilities others continue to plague researchers and those responsible for providing biomedical scientists with animals free of adventitious disease long-recognized agents that remain in research facilities in the 21 st century include parvoviruses of rats and mice mouse rotavirus theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev mouse hepatitis virus mhv and pinworms the reasons for their persistence vary with the agent the resilience of parvoviruses for example is due to their resistance to inactivation their prolonged shedding and difficulties with detection especially in c57bl/6 mice rotavirus also has marked environmental resistance but periodic reintroduction into facilities possibly on bags of feed bedding or other supplies or equipment also seems likely tmev is characterized by resistance to inactivation periodic reintroduction and relatively long shedding periods although mhv remains active in the environment at most a few days currently prevalent strains are shed in massive quantities and likely transmitted by fomites pinworm infestations continue because of prolonged infections inefficient diagnosis and the survivability of eggs of some species in the environment for all of these agents increases in both interinstitutional shipping and the use of immunodeficient or genetically modified rodents of unknown immune status may contribute to the problem as might incursions by wild or feral rodents elimination of these old enemies will require improved detection strict adherence to protocols designed to limit the spread of infections and comprehensive eradication programs
in terms of its highly pathogenic nature there remains a significant need to further define the immune pathology of sarscoronavirus sars-cov infection as well as identify correlates of immunity to help develop vaccines for severe coronaviral infections here we use a sars-cov infection-reinfection ferret model and a functional genomics approach to gain insight into sars immunopathogenesis and to identify correlates of immune protection during sars-cov-challenge in ferrets previously infected with sars-cov or immunized with a sars virus vaccine we identified gene expression signatures in the lungs of ferrets associated with primary immune responses to sars-cov infection and in ferrets that received an identical second inoculum acute sars-cov infection prompted coordinated innate immune responses that were dominated by antiviral ifn response gene irg expression reinfected ferrets however lacked the integrated expression of irgs that was prevalent during acute infection the expression of specific irgs was also absent upon challenge in ferrets immunized with an inactivated aloh 3 -adjuvanted whole virus sars vaccine candidate that protected them against sars-cov infection in the lungs lack of ifn-mediated immune enhancement in infected ferrets that were previously inoculated with or vaccinated against sars-cov revealed 9 irg correlates of protective immunity this data provides insight into the molecular pathogenesis of sars-cov and sars-like-cov infections and is an important resource for the development of cov antiviral therapeutics and vaccines citation cameron mj kelvin aa leon aj cameron cm ran l et al 2012 lack of innate interferon responses during sars coronavirus infection in a vaccination and reinfection ferret model plos one 79 e45842
dna vaccines expressing codon-optimized venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev and ebola virus ebov glycoprotein genes provide protective immunity to mice and nonhuman primates when delivered by intramuscular im electroporation ep to achieve equivalent protective efficacy in the absence of ep we evaluated veev and ebov dna vaccines constructed using minimalized nanoplasmid expression vectors that are smaller than conventional plasmids used for dna vaccination these vectors may also be designed to co-express type i interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pwrg7077-based vaccines when delivered by im injection and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes the nanoplasmid veev dna vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol veev challenge as compared to the pwrg7077 veev dna vaccine although all mice receiving the pwrg7077 and nanoplasmid ebov dna vaccines at the dose tested survived ebov challenge only mice receiving the nanoplasmid ebov dna vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge our results suggest that nanoplasmid vectors can improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of alphavirus and filovirus dna vaccines
from 28 young children in the netherlands we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative new member of the metapneumovirus genus based on virological data sequence homology and gene constellation previously avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus human metapneumovirus the clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia serological studies showed that by the age of five years virtually all children in the netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years
bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and can be native or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus pestivirus under the family flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts including swine and ruminants two classic types of pestiviruses bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus are important causative agents of mild-to-severe disease in bovine and swine hosts respectively and cause tremendous economic losses in these industries recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus which cause disease in piglets showed a close genetic relationship with a specific bat pestivirus rapestv-1 this study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout china two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced these viruses were identified from two bat species and four rodent species in different chinese provinces there were two distinct lineages present in these viruses that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus these findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous hosts this study may provide new insight for the prevention of future viral disease outbreaks originating from bats and rodents
single dose treatments have the important advantages of simple administration excellent compliance short-lived side effects if any and short period of drug pressure however drugs used for single dose treatments must possess important characteristics namely long half-life effective concentration in tissues over a long period and low toxicity in tropical medicine such drugs are an important advance in the treatment of malaria mefioquine and halofantrine schistosomiasis praziquantel and metrifonate filariasis ivermectin and genitourinary tract and intestinal infections intestinal infections are one of the most frequent problems in tropical medicine while a large number of cases of diarrhoea are of viral rotavirus or bacterial salmonella escherichia coli origin necessitating only oral rehydration some are of parasitological origin giardia entamoeba histolytica strongyloides trichuris schistosoma and can be cured by a single dose treatment tinidazole secnidazole ivermectin albendazole praziquantel secnidazole is the nitroimidazole with the longest half-life and is therefore used in single dose treatments for giardia acute intestinal amoebiasis and e histolytica cyst carriers single dose treatments of most intestinal parasites will be a major advance in the management of tropical infectious diarrhoea in the next decade opportunistic intestinal infections cryptosporidium isospora enterocytozoon in aids patients that are refractory to treatment could be the major problem
two neutralizing human scfv b1 and h12 were identified initially using elisa employing highly purified virus as the coating antigen the biosensor technique based on imaging ellipsometry was employed directly to detect two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and serial serum samples from 10 sars patients and 12 volunteers who had not sars further the kinetic process of interaction between the antibodies and sars-cov was studied using the real-time function of the biosensor the biosensor is consistent with elisa that the antibody h12 showed a higher affinity in encountering the virus than antibody b1 the affinity of antibody b1 and antibody h12 was 9.5 × 10 6 m −1 and 1.36 × 10 7 m −1 respectively as a label free method the biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry proved to be a more competent mechanism for measuring serum samples from sars patients and the affinity between these antibodies and the sars coronavirus
four outbreaks of infectious canine hepatitis ich occurring in italy between 2001 and 2006 are reported three outbreaks were observed in animal shelters of southern italy whereas a fourth outbreak involved two purebred pups imported from hungary few days before the onset of clinical symptoms in all outbreaks canine adenovirus type 1 cav-1 was identified by virus isolation and pcr in three outbreaks other canine viral pathogens were detected including canine distemper virus canine parvovirus or canine coronavirus the present study shows that cav-1 is currently circulating in the italian dog population and that vaccination is still required
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has two genotypes g1 and g2 to research the immunogenicity differences of pedv g1 and g2 genotype strains and obtain a neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab we inoculated specific-pathogen-free balb/c mice with a newly emerged strain pedv-lnct2 after immunizations cells from the spleen of the mice were fused with sp2/0 myeloma cells following culturing and subcloning a strain 1b9 secreting neutralizing antibody was obtained the 1b9 mab neutralized new variant genotype 2 pedv strains lnct2 lnsy and hjms but it did not neutralize a genotype 1 pedv strain cv777 in vitro results showed that the epitope recognized by the 1b9 mab lies in the spike protein and that it is a conformational epitope these findings confirm that allelic differences in the pedv s gene between the g1 and g2 genotype strains led to changes in the s protein and thus differences in its immunogenicity
a novel vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea bvd induced pathogenic antibody production in 5-10% of bvd-vaccinated cows transfer of these antibodies via colostrum caused bovine neonatal pancytopenia bnp in calves with a lethality rate of 90%. the exact immunological mechanisms behind the onset of bnp are not fully understood to date to gain further insight into these mechanisms we analyzed the immune proteome from alloreactive antibody producers bnp cows and non-responders after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes pbl we detected distinctly deviant expression levels of several master regulators of immune responses in bnp cells pointing to a changed immune phenotype with severe dysregulation of immune response in bnp cows interestingly we also found this response pattern in 22% of non-bvd-vaccinated cows indicating a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant id phenotype in cattle we additionally analyzed the functional correlation of the id phenotype with 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months the significantly increased prevalence of mastitis among id cows emphasizes the clinical relevance of this deviant immune response and its potential impact on the ability to fight infections
infection with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness therefore the prevalence of mers-cov infections in the general population could be underestimated which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-mers-cov antibodies in high-and low-risk groups in qatar a total of 4858 samples were screened including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors bd over a period of five years 2012-2016 135 samples from baseline case contacts cc collected from individuals in close contact with three positive pcr-confirmed patients cp and four samples from mers-cov cp initial screening using anti-mers-cov igg igg rs1-elisa kit revealed ten reactive samples from bd 10/4719 0.21% one from cc 1/135 0.74% and three from cp 3/4 75%. samples from cp but not from bd were also reactive by whole-virus anti-mers-cov igg n = 3/4 and igm n = 1/4 indirect immunefluorescent tests iift and pseudoparticle neutralization test ppnt the reactive sample from cc was also confirmed by ppnt surprisingly one out of thirteen 7.7% randomly selected igg rs1-elisa-negative bd samples from the initial screening was reactive by the igm-iift but not by the igg-iift and was subsequently confirmed by ppnt all igg rs1-elisa-reactive samples from bd exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses hku1 oc43 229e and nl63 cross-reactivity with sars was only reported for samples from cp using igg and igm-iift in conclusion we report a low prevalence of anti-mers antibodies in the general population which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study 2017 in qatar n = 21 the false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between mers-cov and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays
inoculation of plasmid dna encoding an immunogenic protein gene of an infectious agent stands out as a novel approach for developing new generation vaccines for prevention of infectious diseases of animals the potential of dna vaccines to act in presence of maternal antibodies its stability and cost effectiveness and the non-requirement of cold chain have heightened the prospects even though great strides have been made in nucleic acid vaccination still there are many areas that need further research for its wholesome practical implementation major areas of concern are vaccine delivery designing of suitable vectors and cytotoxic t cell responses also the induction of immune responses by dna vaccines is inconclusive due to the lack of knowledge regarding the concentration of the protein expressed in vivo alternative delivery systems having higher transfection efficiency and the use of cytokines as immunomodulators needs to be further explored recently efforts are being made to modulate and prolong the active life of dendritic cells in order to make antigen presentation a more efficacious one for combating diseases like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids influenza malaria and tuberculosis in humans and foot and mouth disease aujesky's disease swine fever rabies canine distemper and brucellosis in animals dna vaccine clinical trials are underway this review highlights the salient features of dna vaccines and measures to enhance their efficacy so as to devise an effective and novel vaccination strategy against animal diseases
background middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in 2012 causing severe acute respiratory disease and pneumonia with 44% mortality among 136 cases to date design of vaccines to limit the virus spread or diagnostic tests to track newly emerging strains requires knowledge of antigenic and serologic relationships between mers-cov and other covs methods using synthetic genomics and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons vrps expressing spike and nucleocapsid proteins from mers-cov and other human and bat covs we characterize the antigenic responses using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serologic responses using neutralization assays against 2 mers-cov isolates in comparison with those of other human and bat covs results serologic and neutralization responses against the spike glycoprotein were primarily strain specific with a very low level of cross-reactivity within or across subgroups cov n proteins within but not across subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with mers-cov isolates our findings were validated using a convalescent-phase serum specimen from a patient infected with mers-cov na 01 and human antiserum against sars-cov human cov nl63 and human cov oc43 conclusions vaccine design for emerging covs should involve chimeric spike protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across subgroups to reduce immune pathology and a diagnostic platform should include a panel of nucleocapsid and spike proteins from phylogenetically distinct covs
recombinant plant expression systems offer a means to produce large quantities of selected antigens for subunit vaccines cereals are particularly well-suited expression vehicles since the expressed proteins can be stored at relatively high concentrations for extended periods of time without degradation and dry seed can be formulated into oral vaccines suitable for commercial applications a subunit vaccine candidate directed against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and expressed in corn seed has been developed for oral delivery to swine here we show that this vaccine when administered to previously sensitized gilts can boost neutralizing antibody levels in the animals' serum colostrum and milk thus this vaccine candidate is effective at boosting lactogenic immunity and is appropriate to pursue through large-scale field trials preceding commercialization
infectious bronchitis virus ibv represents a major threat to poultry production worldwide particularly when complicated with bacterial infection in the present study samples were collected from forty broiler farms with respiratory manifestations to characterize ibv and e coli bacteriophages were isolated and enriched from sampled farms to study its efficacy to control single and mixed infections with e coli and ibv in vivo twelve out of forty farms were positive for ibv phylogenetic analysis of partial spike protein revealed that all positive cases clustered within the gi-23 genotype eight out of forty farms were positive for e coli serogroups o26 o78 o86 o114 o119 with o125 found on three farms bacteriophage treatment delayed the onset and reduced the severity of clinical signs and prevented the mortality associated with single and mixed infection with ibv and e coli furthermore in mixed infections bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced e coli as well as ibv shedding groups treated with bacteriophages showed a significant reduction of e coli shedding that gradually decreased over time in contrast to higher and gradually increasing shedding without bacteriophage treatment in conclusion bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced the pathogenicity and shedding of ibvand e coli in mixed infections article history
in this in vitro study the replication kinetics of porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 in porcine alveolar macrophages pam and fetal cardiomyocytes fcm two target cells in vivo was compared with that in pk-15 cells cultures were inoculated with either the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws-associated strain stoon-1010 or the abortion-associated strain 1121 viral proteins were visualized and virus production was determined in pk-15 cells the capsid protein was expressed between 6 and 12 hours post inoculation hpi it relocated to the nucleus between 12 and 24 hpi at that time rep protein was also detected in the nucleus this sequence of events also occurred in fcm and pam but nuclear localized antigens appeared later 48 hpi and in a lower percentage of cells in pam clear differences in susceptibility were seen between pigs in pam from two out of five tested pigs nuclear localized antigens were not detected whereas in pam from three other pigs they were seen in up to 20% of the antigen-positive cells virus production was observed in pk-15 but not in pam or fcm cultures in a second study the replication kinetics of seven different pcv2 strains were compared in pk-15 cells it was shown that the two abortion-associated strains had a different replication kinetics in comparison with pmws or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome associated strains with the abortion-associated strains a higher number of infected cells was observed at 24 hpi and the percentage of infected cells with nuclear localised antigens was lower compared to that of other strains 428 p meerts et al
background since 2010 outbreaks of genotype 2 g2 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv have caused high mortality in neonatal piglets and have had devastating impacts on the swine industry in many countries a reliable serological assay for evaluating the pedv-specific humoral and mucosal immune response is important for disease survey monitoring the efficacy of immunization and designing strategies for the prevention and control of ped two pedv spike s glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas were developed using g2b pedv-pintung 52 pedv-pt trimeric full-length s and truncated s 1-501 proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney hek-293 cell expression system the truncated s 1-501 protein was selected from a superior expressed stable cell line the sensitivity and specificity of these two elisas were compared to immunostaining of g2b pedv-pt infected cells and to a commercial nucleocapsid n-based indirect elisa kit using a panel of pedv negative and hyperimmune sera the commercial n-based elisa exhibited a sensitivity of 37% a specificity of 100% and a fair agreement kappa = 0.37 with the immunostaining result in comparison the full-length s-based elisa showed a sensitivity of 97.8% a specificity of 94% and an almost perfect agreement kappa = 0.90 with the immunostaining result interestingly the s 1-501 -based elisa had even higher sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 99.1% and an almost perfect agreement kappa = 0.97 with the immunostaining result a fair agreement kappa< 0.4 was seen between the commercial n-based elisa and either of our s-based elisas however the results of the full-length s-based elisa shared an almost perfect agreement kappa = 0.92 with that of s 1-501 -based elisa continued on next page

porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv belongs to the genus alphacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhoea vomiting dehydration and high mortality in seronegative newborn piglets thus a precise and rapid diagnosis of pedv infection is important for the application of control measures to limit viral dissemination in this investigation a monoclonal antibodies mabs-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for detecting antibodies against pedv was developed and validated the diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic roc analysis using a panel of 829 known sera collected from different commercial pig farms with or without a history of ped presence and from experimentally infected pigs the competitive elisa showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with high sensitivity se and specificity sp values se = 96.5% 95% ic 94.1-98.1 sp = 98.2% 95% ic 96.3-99.3 moreover this competitive elisa method has other properties such as high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and automatic and instrument-mediated revealing that makes it appropriate for large-scale screenings of affected pig farms in endemic regions or for monitoring plans in pedvfree areas
background approximately 30% of children worldwide are infected with gastrointestinal parasites depending on the species parasites can disrupt intestinal bacterial microbiota affecting essential vitamin biosynthesis methods stool samples were collected from 37 asymptomatic children from a previous cross-sectional argentinian study a multi-parallel real-time quantitative pcr was implemented for ascaris lumbricoides ancylostoma duodenale necator americanus strongyloides stercoralis trichuris trichiura cryptosporidium spp entamoeba histolytica and giardia duodenalis in addition whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted for bacterial microbiota on all samples and analyzed using livermore metagenomic analysis toolkit and diamond software separate analyses were carried out for uninfected giardia-only giardia + helminth co-infections and helminth-only groups for giardia-only infected children compared to uninfected children dna sequencing data showed a decrease in microbiota biodiversity that correlated with increasing giardia burden and was statistically significant using shannonʼs alpha diversity giardia-only > 1 fg/µl 2.346 non-infected group 3.253 p = 0.0317 an increase in diversity was observed for helminth-only infections with a decrease in diversity for giardia + helminth co-infections p = 0.00178 in giardia-only infections microbiome taxonomy changed from firmicutes towards increasing proportions of prevotella with the degree of change related to the intensity of infection compared to uninfected p = 0.0317 the abundance of prevotella bacteria was decreased in the helminths-only group but increased for giardia + helminth co-infections p = 0.0262 metagenomic analysis determined cobalamin synthesis was decreased in the giardia > 1 fg/µl group compared to both the giardia < 1 fg/µl and the uninfected group p = 0.0369 giardia + helminth group also had a decrease in cobalamin cbim genes from helminth-only infections p = 0.000754 the study results may provide evidence for an effect of parasitic infections enabling the permissive growth of anaerobic bacteria such as prevotella suggesting an altered capacity of vitamin b12 cobalamin biosynthesis and potential impact on growth and development in children .
diarrhea is a major clinical problem affecting foals up to 3 months of age the aim of this study was to identify enteric microorganisms involved in monoinfections and coinfections and the associated virulence factors in healthy and diarrheic foals diarrheic d = 56 and nondiarrheic nd foals = 60 up to three months of age were studied fecal samples were analyzed for identification of infectious agents microbiological culturing molecular techniques and microscopic analyses escherichia coli fimh 30% versus 25% salmonella spp 25% versus 7% strongyloides westeri 25% versus 25% clostridium perfringens type a 21% versus 10% e coli ag43 20% versus 35% strongylus 11% versus 18% and vapa-positive rhodococcus equi 5% versus 2% were the most frequent enteric pathogens detected in d and nd foals respectively the frequency of toxin a-positive c perfringens was significantly increased in the d = 0.033 compared with the nd animals r equi strains harboring virulent plasmids were also identified vapa 85-kb type i and vapa 87-kb type i in d and nd foals coinfections were observed in 46% of the d and 33% of the nd foals our results demonstrate the great diversity of enteric pathogens virulence factors and coinfections involved in enteric infections of foals
canine parvovirus cpv-2 is an enteric virus causing morbidity and mortality in dogs worldwide since cpv-2 emerged as canine pathogen the original cpv-2 strain has constantly evolved and its primary variants cpv-2a cpv-2b and cpv-2c co-circulate to varying extents in canine populations worldwide thus rapid and accurate laboratory diagnoses of cpv-2 variants are crucial to monitor cpv-2 evolution conventional methods for cpv-2 genotyping are laborious time consuming and determining the genotype of a cpv-2 variant often requires two or more reaction tubes the present study developed a probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis fmca for genotyping six different cpv-2 variants original cpv-2 cpv-2a cpv-2b cpv-2c and vaccine strains of cpvpf and cpvint in a single reaction tube using only two taqman probes one of the taqman probes fam labeled was designed to perfectly match with the target sequence of cpv-2a this probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the cpv-2b vp2 gene region a4062g and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization for cpv-2c a4062g and t4064a another taqman probe hex labeled was produced to perfectly match with the target sequence of original cpv-2 this probe enables 1bp mismatched hybridization with the other cpv-2 variants a3045t using the two taqman probes all six cpv-2 variants were readily distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in a single reaction tube the detection limits of this assay were 1-10 copies per reaction for six cpv-2 construction plasmids and no cross reactions were observed with several other common canine viruses in this assay coinfected samples were also directly identified via probe-based fmca without using a mixing control only a pure control is required the clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analyzing 83 clinical fecal samples among which 41 49.39% 8 9.63% and 14 16.87% samples were found to be positive for cpv-2a cpv-2b and cpv-2c respectively the concordance rate between probe-based fmca and sanger sequencing was 100%. thus the duplex fmca is effective rapid simple high-throughput and straightforward for genotyping cpv-2 variants and is useful to effectively diagnose and monitor cpv-2 epidemiology
a number of new virus infections have emerged or re-emerged during the past 15 years some viruses are spreading to new areas along with climate and environmental changes the majority of these infections are transmitted from animals to humans and thus called zoonoses zoonotic viruses are as compared to human-only viruses much more difficult to eradicate infections by several of these viruses may lead to high mortality and also attract attention because they are potential bioweapons this review will focus on zoonotic virus infections occurring in europe
emerging and reemerging diseases that result from pathogen host shifts are a threat to the health of humans and their domesticates rna viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases in the present study we showed that a plant-pathogenic rna virus tobacco ringspot virus trsv could replicate and produce virions in honeybees apis mellifera resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body additionally we showed that trsv-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies while intracellular life cycle species-level genetic variation and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined the increasing prevalence of trsv in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival furthermore we showed that trsv was also found in ectoparasitic varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of varroa mites suggesting that varroa mites may facilitate the spread of trsv in bees but do not experience systemic invasion finally our phylogenetic analysis revealed that trsv isolates from bees bee pollen and varroa mites clustered together forming a monophyletic clade importance pathogen host shifts represent a major source of new infectious diseases here we provide evidence that a pollenborne plant virus tobacco ringspot virus trsv also replicates in honeybees and that the virus systemically invades and replicates in different body parts in addition the virus was detected inside the body of parasitic varroa mites which consume bee hemolymph suggesting that varroa mites may play a role in facilitating the spread of the virus in bee colonies this study represents the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen could also be infected and raises awareness of potential risks of new viral disease emergence due to host shift events about 5% of known plant viruses are pollen transmitted and these are potential sources of future host-jumping viruses the findings from this study showcase the need for increased surveillance for potential host-jumping events as an integrated part of insect pollinator management programs yp 2014 systemic spread and propagation of a plant-pathogenic virus in european honeybees apis mellifera mbio 51e00898-13
causative agent dengue fever df dengue haemorrhagic fever dhf and dengue shock syndrome dss are progressively more severe clinical manifestations of dengue infection caused by four single-strand rna flaviviruses known as den-1-4 virus transmission occurs through the infective bite of aedes aegypti a mosquito with high biting frequencies and readily interrupted feeding behaviour the virus replicates in lymph nodes spleen liver and mononuclear phagocytic cells in other tissue systems
background herpes b virus bv is a zoonotic disease caused by double-stranded enveloped dna virus with cercopithecidae as its natural host the mortality rate of infected people could be up to 70% with fatal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis up to now there are no effective treatments for bv infection among the various proteins encoded by monkey b virus gd a conserved structural protein harbors important application value for serological diagnosis of frequent variations of the monkey b virus objectives this study aimed to expressed the gd protein of bv in escherichia coli by a recombinant vector and prepare specific monoclonal antibodies against gd of bv to pave the way for effective and quick diagnosis reagent research the gd gene of bv was optimized by optimwiz to improve codon usage bias and synthesis and the recombinant plasmid pet32a/gd was constructed and expressed in e coli rosetta de3 the expressed fusion protein his-gd was purified and the balb/c mice were immunized by this protein spleen cells from the immunized mice and sp2/0 myeloma cells were fused together and the monoclonal cell strains were obtained by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa screening followed by preparation of monoclonal antibody ascetic fluid the optimized gd protein was highly expressed in e coli and successfully purified five monoclonal antibodies mabs against bv were obtained and named as 4e3 3f8 3e7 1h3 and 4b6 and with ascetic fluid titers of 2 × 10 6 2 × 10 5 2 × 10 5 2 × 10 3 and 2 × 10 2 respectively the 1h3 and 4e3 belonged to the igg2b subclass while 3e7 3f8 and 4b6 belonged to the igg1 subclass the cell lines obtained in this work secreted potent stable and specific anti-bv mabs which were suitable for the development of herpes b virus diagnosis reagents
epitope-based vaccines designed to induce antibody responses specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov are being developed as a means for increasing vaccine potency in this study we identified four b cell epitopes from the spike s and membrane m protein through bioinformatics analysis and constructed a multi-epitope dna vaccine intramuscular immunization of mice with this vaccine was sufficient to induce specific prime as well as a long-term memory humoral immune response to at least two candidate epitopes s 437-459 and m 1-20 . a dna prime-protein boost strategy greatly enhanced the antibody generation and the immune sera not only reacted with the lysates of sars-cov-infected vero cells but also neutralized the cytopathic effect of sars by 75% at 1160 dilution the novel immunogenic s protein peptide revealed in this study provides new target for sars vaccine design and our work indicated multi-epitope dna vaccine as an effective means for eliciting polyvalent humoral immune response against sars-cov
we identified a novel rhabdovirus american bat vesiculovirus from postmortem tissue samples from 120 rabiesnegative big brown bats with a history of human contact five percent of the tested bats were infected with this virus the extent of zoonotic exposure and possible health effects in humans from this virus are unknown
an outbreak of canine infectious respiratory disease cird associated to canine pneumovirus cnpnv infection is reported the outbreak occurred in a shelter of the apulia region and involved 37 out of 350 dogs that displayed cough and/or nasal discharge with no evidence of fever the full-genomic characterisation showed that the causative agent strain bari/100-12 was closely related to cnpnvs that have been recently isolated in the usa as well as to murine pneumovirus which is responsible for respiratory disease in mice the present study represents a useful contribution to the knowledge of the pathogenic potential of cnpnv and its association with cird in dogs further studies will elucidate the pathogenicity and epidemiology of this novel pneumovirus thus addressing the eventual need for specific vaccines
viral subunit vaccines often contain immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes that divert host immune responses these epitopes should be eliminated in vaccine design but there is no reliable method for evaluating an epitope's capacity to elicit neutralizing immune responses here we introduce a new concept 'neutralizing immunogenicity index' nii to evaluate an epitope's neutralizing immunogenicity to determine the nii we mask the epitope with a glycan probe and then assess the epitope's contribution to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity as proof-of-concept we measure the nii for different epitopes on an immunogen comprised of the receptor-binding domain from mers coronavirus mers-cov further we design a variant form of this vaccine by masking an epitope that has a negative nii score this engineered vaccine demonstrates significantly enhanced efficacy in protecting transgenic mice from lethal mers-cov challenge our study may guide the rational design of highly effective subunit vaccines to combat mers-cov and other life-threatening viruses
the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis vomiting watery diarrhea and a high mortality rate in seronegative neonatal piglets in the last few years ped had a large economic impact on the swine industries in asia and the us and in 2014 the pedv also re-emerged in europe two main pedv variants circulate worldwide but only the s indel variant considered a mild strain is spreading in europe to gain insights into the pathogenicity of this variant its viral load and temporal shedding pattern were evaluated in piglets from infected farms quantitative real-time pcr qpcr targeting the spike gene was validated according to the minimum information for quantitative real-time pcr experiments guidelines the qpcr was applied to longitudinal studies conducted in four swine farms naturally infected with the pedv s indel variant clinical data fecal swabs and blood samples were collected from 103 piglets at 15-30-day intervals for 2-5 months on all four farms diarrhea was observed in sows during gestation and in farrowing units and the mortality rates of piglets were 18 25 30 and 35%. different clinical pictures 0−50% of diarrhea positivity viral titer levels mean 5.3−7.2 log 10 genome copies/ml and antibody conditions 30−80% of positivity were registered among sows on the four farms the percentage of qpcr positive piglets varied greatly from the beginning 63-100% to the end 0% of the infection course clinical signs were present in 96% of the qpcr positive animals viral loads ranged from 8.5 log 10 to 4 log 10 genome copies/ml in suckling pigs at 3-6 days of age and were not statistically different among farms despite the different patterns observed in sows after 2-3 weeks only a few piglets still showed detectable viral levels and clinical signs and they developed antibody responses moreover co-infections with other pathogens and biosecurity procedures limiting the circulation of the virus could have influenced the severity of ped infection qpcr and clinical data were useful in understanding the dynamics of pedv infections and therefore in implementing appropriate control measures
the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza a virus hpaiv subtype h5n1 in 1997 has since resulted in large outbreaks in poultry and in transmission from poultry to humans mostly in southeast asia but also in several european countries effective diagnosis and control measures are essential for the management of hpaiv infections to develop a rapid diagnostic test a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies mabs against influenza virus a subtype h5 was generated eleven mabs were produced and characterised according to their reactivity by indirect and sandwich elisa and western blotting against different h5 subtypes representing past and viruses currently circulating ten out of 11 mabs reacted strongly with the haemagglutinin ha protein of h5 viruses whereas one mab reacted with the m1 protein targeted ha protein epitopes seemed to be conformational one hybridoma clone binds to a linear epitope of the m1 protein one specific mab reacts with hpaiv h5 in the immunofluorescence test and two antibodies neutralised h5 viruses on the basis of the results the set of seven mabs is appropriate for developing diagnostic tests with the generated mabs a sandwich elisa was developed recognising all h5n1 strains tested but no other influenza viruses with this elisa as little as 0.005 ha units or 0.1 ng/ml h5n1 was detected surpassing other elisa tests the novel reagents have the potential to improve significantly available rapid antigen detection systems
humans may be infected by different influenza a viruses-seasonal pandemic and zoonotic-which differ in presentation from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe and sometimes fatal pneumonia with extra-respiratory spread differences in spatial and temporal dynamics of these infections are poorly understood therefore we inoculated ferrets with seasonal h3n2 pandemic h1n1 ph1n1 and highly pathogenic avian h5n1 influenza virus and performed detailed virological and pathological analyses at time points from 0.5 to 14 days post inoculation dpi as well as describing clinical signs and hematological parameters h3n2 infection was restricted to the nose and peaked at 1 dpi ph1n1 infection also peaked at 1 dpi but occurred at similar levels throughout the respiratory tract h5n1 infection occurred predominantly in the alveoli where it peaked for a longer period from 1 to 3 dpi the associated lesions followed the same spatial distribution as virus infection but their severity peaked between 1 and 6 days later neutrophil and monocyte counts in peripheral blood correlated with inflammatory cell influx in the alveoli of the different parameters used to measure lower respiratory tract disease relative lung weight and affected lung tissue allowed the best quantitative distinction between the virus groups there was extra-respiratory spread to more tissues-including the central nervous system-for h5n1 infection than for ph1n1 infection and to none for h3n2 infection this study shows that seasonal pandemic and zoonotic influenza viruses differ strongly in the spatial and temporal dynamics of infection in the respiratory tract and extra-respiratory tissues of ferrets
bats chiroptera are the only mammals naturally able to fly due to this characteristic they play a relevant ecological role in the niches they inhabit these mammals spread infectious diseases from enzootic to domestic foci rabbies sars fungi ebola and trypanosomes are the most common pathogens these animals may host we conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from casanare department in eastern colombia blood-edta samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species the findings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of trypanosoma cruzi cruzi 51% t c marinkellei 9% t dionisii 13% t rangeli 21% t evansi 4% and t theileri 2% among 107 positive bat specimens regarding the t cruzi dtus we observed the presence of tci 60% tcii 15% tciii 7% tciv 7% and tcbat 11% being the first evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype tcbat in colombia these results allowed us to propose reliable hypotheses regarding the ecology and biology of the bats circulating in the area including the enigmatic question whether tcbat should be considered a novel dtu the epidemiological and evolutionary implications of these findings are herein discussed
the high case-fatality rate of confirmed mers-cov infections underlines the urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the disease severity and mortality regn3051 and regn3048 are two fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies mab against mers-cov that reduced virus replication in mice expressing human dpp4 upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment here we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of regn3048 and regn3051 in the common marmoset model of mers-cov infection intravenous administration of mab resulted in high levels of mers-cov-neutralizing activity in circulating blood when animals were treated with mabs one day before challenge respiratory disease was less severe and in animals treated with both regn3048 and regn3051 viral loads in the lungs were reduced however therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals thus mab administration may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment of mers
bats are a unique group of mammals of the order chiroptera they are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission this article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses covs before the sars epidemic bats were not known to be hosts for covs in the last 15 years bats have been found to be hosts of >30 covs with complete genomes sequenced and many more if those without genome sequences are included among the four cov genera only alphacovs and betacovs have been found in bats as a whole both alphacovs and betacovs have been detected from bats in asia europe africa north and south america and australasia but alphacovs seem to be more widespread than betacovs and their detection rate is also higher for betacovs only those from subgenera sarbecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus and hibecovirus have been detected in bats most notably horseshoe bats are the reservoir of sars-cov and several betacovs from subgenus merbecovirus are closely related to mers-cov in addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves bat-animal and bat-human interactions such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in southern china are important for interspecies transmission of covs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks
we have recently developed a transmissible vaccine to immunize rabbits against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease based on a recombinant myxoma virus mv expressing the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus rhdv capsid protein . administration of the recombinant virus protects rabbits against lethal rhdv and mv challenges furthermore the recombinant virus is capable of horizontal spreading promoting protection of contact animals thus providing the opportunity to immunize wild rabbit populations however potential risks must be extensively evaluated before considering its ®eld use in this study several safety issues concerning the proposed vaccine have been evaluated under laboratory conditions results indicated that vaccine administration is safe even at a 100-fold overdose no undesirable eects were detected upon administration to immunosuppressed or pregnant rabbits the recombinant virus maintained its attenuated phenotype after 10 passages in vivo 7
monoclonal antibodies to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv membrane protein m were prepared and used for the comparative assessment of three blocking elisa variants to detect pedv the competitive blocking elisa cb-elisa format showed the highest sensitivity allowing detection of 10 2.5 plaque-forming units of pedv/ml in culture medium its specificity was verified by inclusion of control samples containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and rotavirus a in each analysis eighty porcine field samples of faeces obtained from 38 herds affected with diarrhoea were examined and pedv was found in 15 19% samples from 6 16% herds the suitability of the cb-elisa for the screening herds in epizootiologic situations is discussed #
background rift valley fever rvf is a viral zoonosis that historically affects livestock production and human health in sub-saharan africa though epizootics have also occurred in the arabian peninsula whilst an effective live-attenuated vaccine is available for livestock there is currently no licensed human rvf vaccine replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus chad vectors are an ideal platform for development of a human rvf vaccine given the low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against them in the human population and their excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in human clinical trials of vaccines against a wide range of pathogens methods here in balb/c mice we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector chadox1 encoding the rvf virus envelope glycoproteins gn and gc which are targets of virus neutralizing antibodies the chadox1-gngc vaccine was assessed in comparison to a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector encoding gn and gc hadv5-gngc a strategy previously shown to confer protective immunity against rvf in mice results a single immunization with either of the vaccines conferred protection against rvf virus challenge eight weeks post-immunization both vaccines elicited rvf virus neutralizing antibody and a robust cd8 + t cell response conclusions together the results support further development of rvf vaccines based on replication-deficient adenovirus vectors with chadox1-gngc being a potential candidate for use in future human clinical trials
since 1997 human infection with avian h5n1 having about 60% mortality has posed a threat to public health in this review we describe the epidemiology of h5n1 transmission advantages and disadvantages of different influenza vaccine types and characteristics of adenovirus finally summarizing advances in adenovirus-based h5n1 systemic and mucosal vaccines
our previous study demonstrated that chickens immunized subcutaneously with an eimeria recombinant profilin protein vaccine emulsified in a quil a/cholesterol/dda/carbopol qcdc adjuvant developed partial protection against experimental avian coccidiosis compared with animals immunized with profilin alone because in ovo vaccination is presently used in commercial applications worldwide throughout the poultry industry the current study was undertaken to investigate chicken embryo vaccination with profilin plus qcdc adjuvant eighteen day-old embryos were immunized with isotonic saline control profilin alone qcdc alone or profilin plus qcdc and orally challenged with live eimeria maxima at 7 days post-hatch body weight gain fecal oocyst output and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity while immunization with profilin alone or qcdc alone did not alter body weight gain of infected chickens compared with the saline control group vaccination with profilin plus qcdc increased body weight gain such that it was equal to the uninfected controls immunization with profilin plus qcdc also reduced fecal oocyst shedding compared with unimmunized controls although in this case qcdc failed to provide an adjuvant effect since no difference was observed between the profilin-only and profilin/qcdc groups finally increased levels of transcripts encoding il-1␤ il-15 and ifn-␥ were seen in the intestinal tissues of animals given profilin plus qcdc compared with the profilin-only or qcdc-only groups in summary this study demonstrates an adjuvant effect of qcdc on body weight gain and intestinal cytokine responses following in ovo vaccination of chickens with an eimeria profilin vaccine
a vero cell attenuated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv strain dr13 was distinguished from wild-type pedv using restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism rflp cell attenuated dr13 was orally or intramuscularly im administered to late-term pregnant sows and mortality resulting from the highly virulent pedv challenge was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets of the two different groups the mortality rate of the oral group 13% was lower than that of the im group 60%. in particular the concentration of iga against pedv was higher in piglets of sows in the oral group compared to the im group the attenuated dr13 virus remained safe even after three backpassages in piglets the findings of this study support the theory that the vero cell attenuated dr13 virus may be applied as an oral vaccine for inducing specific immunity in late-term pregnant sows with a high margin of protection against pedv infection
an epizootic of feline infectious peritonitis in a captive cheetah population during 1982-1983 served to focus attention on the susceptibility of the cheetah acinoyx jubatus to infectious disease subsequent observations based upon seroepidemiological surveys and electron microscopy of fecal material verified that cheetahs were indeed capable of being infected by coronaviruses which were antigenically related to coronaviruses affecting domestic cats i e feline infectious peritonitis virus/feline enteric coronavirus coincident with the apparent increased susceptibility of the cheetah to infectious diseases were observations that the cheetah was genetically unusual insofar as large amounts of enzyme-encoding loci were monomorphic and that unrelated cheetahs were capable of accepting allogenic skin grafts these data provided the basis for a hypothesis that the cheetah through intensive inbreeding had become more susceptible to viral infections as a result of genetic homogeneity

the aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of the eleven genes of a g6p bovine group a rotavirus rva strain detected in a diarrhea outbreak from a vaccinated beef cattle herd the outbreak affected 80 % of calves between 15-30 days old rva was identified by rt-pcr in 12 70.6 % out of 17 diarrheic fecal samples evaluated the rotavirus wild-type strain had the genotype constellation g6iv-pix-i2c-r2-c2-m2-a3-n2-t6-e2e-h3a this study confirms the importance of homotypic immunity against the bovine rva p genotype in neonatal diarrhea in cattle herds that are regularly vaccinated against rotaviruses
we screened 217 bats of at least 20 species from 17 locations in kenya during july and august of 2006 for the presence of adenovirus rhabdovirus and paramyxovirus nucleic acids using generic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr and pcr assays of 217 bat fecal swabs examined 4 bats were adenovirus dna-positive 11 bats were paramyxovirus rna-positive and 2 bats were rhabdovirus rna-positive three bats were coinfected by two different viruses by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis the kenya bat paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses from this study may represent novel viral lineages within their respective families the kenya bat adenoviruses could not be confirmed as novel because the same region sequences from other known bat adenovirus genomes for comparison were lacking our study adds to previous evidence that bats carry diverse potentially zoonotic viruses and may be coinfected with more than one virus for excellent technical and logistical assistance the authors thank krista queen for her assistance with the manuscript preparation the authors also thank michael lo for his assistance with cell culture isolation and yan li for her assistance with high-throughput sequencing by 454 gs-flx
keywords epidemiology hepatitis e immunization immunocompromised patienthepatitis e virus hev is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide originally considered to be restricted to humans it is now clear that hev and hev-like viruses have several animal reservoirs with complex ecology and genetic diversity as exemplified by the recent discovery of hev in dromedaries a previously underestimated reservoir of zoonotic viruses prior to the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus zoonotic foodborne transmission from pigs and feral animals such as wild boar is of increasing importance in the rapidly industrializing countries of the asia pacific region such zoonotic hepatitis e infection has particular relevance to the increasing population living with immunosuppression due to the risk of chronic hepatitis e in these patients fortunately major strides have been made recently in the management of chronic hepatitis e patients furthermore an effective vaccine is also available that promises better control of hepatitis e burden in the near future this review highlights these major recent developments in the epidemiology treatment and prevention of hepatitis e hepevirus within the family hepeviridae it is a nonenveloped virus measuring approximately 27e34 nm in diameter the single stranded positive sense rna genome of hev comprises three open reading frames orfs orf1 encodes nonstructural proteins including methyltransferase
background foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv causes a severe livestock disease and the virus is an interesting target for virology and vaccine studies here we evaluated comparatively three different viral antigen-encoding dna sequences delivered via two physical means i e gene gun delivery into skin and electroporation delivery into muscle for naked dna-mediated vaccination in a mouse system both methods gave similar results demonstrating commonality of the observed dna vaccine effects immunization with a cdna vector expressing the major viral antigen vp1 alone routinely failed to induce the production of anti-vp1 or neutralizing antibodies in test mice as a second approach the plasmid l-vp1 that produces a transgenic membrane-anchored vp1 protein elicited a strong antibody response but all test mice failed in the fmdv challenge experiment in contrast for mice immunized with the viral capsid precursor protein p1 cdna expression vector both neutralizing antibodies and 80-100% protection in test mice were detected conclusions this strategy of using the whole capsid precursor protein p1 cdna for vaccination intentionally without the use of virus-specific protease or other encoding genes for safety reasons may thus be employed as a relevant experimental system for induction or upgrading of effective neutralizing antibody response and as a convenient surrogate test system for dna vaccination studies of fmdv and presumably other viral diseases
porcine adenovirus padv has many qualities which make it an ideal choice for use as a delivery vector in swine it is a low grade pathogen present almost world-wide in a number of serotypes varying in their virulence and tissue tropism which may allow for serotype specific vaccine targeting padv is species specific having only been isolated from swine reducing the possibility of its spread to other animals or man following administration when engineered to contain a foreign gene recombinant padv rpadv can be grown to high titres in tissue culture cells making it cheap to produce knowledge of the complete nucleotide sequence of the padv genome has enabled rationally directed insertions of foreign genes which remain stably inserted in the genome and can be expressed at high levels following delivery to the target host importantly recombinant padv can be administered by injection or by the oral route in feed or drinking water we have delivered a range of antigens and immunomodulatory molecules to commercially available pigs using rpadv and found it to be a very effective delivery system significantly recombinant padv serotype 3 is highly effective as a delivery vehicle even when administered in the face of high levels of artificially induced serotype specific neutralising antibody to the vector
porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome-like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide the processes resulting in the emergence and spread of pcv3 remain poorly understood herein the possible origin genotypes and evolutionary dynamics of pcv3 based on available genomic sequences are determined the closest ancestor of pcv3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat cvs using different phylogenetic methods two major genotypes are identified pcv3a and pcv3b it is found that the effective population size of pcv3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of pcv3a and pcv3b a relatively high effective reproductive number re value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single-stranded dna viruses and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 24 of orf2 is identified it is hypothesized that this together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320 might have allowed pcv3 to escape from the host immune response overall this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing pcv3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures phylogenetic analysis
development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov is crucial in the prevention of sars reemergence the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike s protein is an important target in developing safe and effective sars vaccines our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adeno-associated virus encoding rbd rbd-raav induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies in this study we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with rbd-raav prime/rbd-specific t cell peptide boost as compared to those of vaccinations with rbd-raav and rbd-peptides alone our results indicated that rbd-raav prime/rbd-peptide boost induced similar th1 and neutralizing antibody responses but stronger th2 and ctl responses than rbd-raav prime/boost the resulting immune responses protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge which was evidenced by lower level of viral replication in mouse lung tissues however no significant immune responses and protective effect were detected in mice vaccinated with rbdpeptides or blank aav alone since t cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory t cells our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective universal and long-term protection against sars-cov infection
oral rabies vaccination orv is highly effective in foxes and raccoon dogs whereas for unknown reasons the efficacy of orv in other reservoir species is less pronounced to investigate possible variations in species-specific cell tropism and local replication of vaccine virus different reservoir species including foxes raccoon dogs raccoons mongooses dogs and skunks were orally immunised with a highly attenuated high-titred gfp-expressing rabies virus rabv immunofluorescence and rt-qpcr screenings revealed clear differences among species suggesting host specific limitations to orv while for responsive species the palatine tonsils tonsilla palatina were identified as a main site of virus replication less virus dissemination was observed in the tonsils of rather refractory species while our comparison of vaccine virus tropism emphasizes the important role that the tonsilla palatina plays in eliciting an immune response to orv our data also indicate that other lymphoid tissues may have a more important role than originally anticipated overall these data support a model in which the susceptibility to oral live rabv vaccine infection of lymphatic tissue is a major determinant in vaccination efficacy the present results may help to direct future research for improving vaccine uptake and efficacy of oral rabies vaccines under field conditions
the gastrointestinal tract of mammals is a complex ecosystem with distinct environments and comprises hundreds of different types of bacterial cells the gut microbiota may play a critical role in the gut health of the host we herein attempted to identify a microbiota shift that may be affected by porcine epidemic diarrhea ped we observed significant differences in microbiota between the control and ped virus pedv-infected groups at both the phylum and genus level most commensal bacteria i e psychrobacter prevotella and faecalibacterium in the healthy gastrointestinal tract were decreased due to dysbiosis induced by pedv infection
we evaluated the efficacy of three sars vaccine candidates in a murine sars model utilizing lowvirulence pp and sars-cov coinfection vaccinated mice were protected from severe respiratory disease in parallel with a low virus titer in the lungs and a high neutralizing antibody titer in the plasma importantly the administration of spike protein-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody protected mice from the disease indicating that the neutralization is sufficient for protection moreover a high level of il-6 and mcp-1 production but not other 18 cytokines tested on days 2 and 3 after sars-cov infection was closely linked to the virus replication and disease severity suggesting the importance of these cytokines in the lung pathogenicity of sars-cov infection
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus a member of the family coronaviridae is an economically important pathogen that causes severe enteritis vomiting dehydration and a high mortality rate especially among suckling piglets here we report the complete genome sequence 28036 nucleotides of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv strain isolated in a novel outbreak in
background recent studies have shown a 13-fold increase of oropharyngeal cancer in the presence of hpv while α-hpv detection seems to be rare in oral cavity in comparison to anal or cervical district many novel β and γ types have been isolated in this anatomical site suggesting a wide tropism range currently there are no guidelines recommending hpv oral cavity screening as a mandatory test and it remains unknown which hpv types should be included in hpv screening programs our goal was to assess hpv prevalence in oropharyngeal anal and cervical swabs using different sets of primerswhich are able to amplify α β γ hpv types we analysed the presence of hpv dna in oropharyngeal n = 124 anal n = 186 cervical specimens n = 43 from hiv positive and negative patients using fap59/64 and my09/11 primers all untyped strains were genetically characterized through pcr amplification and direct sequencing of partial l1 region and the resulting sequences were classified through phylogenetic analysis results hpv prevalence was 20.9% in 124 oropharyngeal swab samples including infections with multiple hpv types 5.6%. hpv prevalence in this anatomical site was significantly associated with serostatus 63.3%in hiv positive and 36.3% in hiv negative patients p < 0.05 unclassified types were detected in 6 specimens in our analysis we did not observe any difference in hpv α β γ prevalence between men and women overall β species were the most frequently detected 69.7%. when using anal swabs for hiv positive patients β genus prevalence was 1% and γ genus was 3.7% including 6 unclassified types in cervical samples from 43 hiv positive women 18 hpv negative and 25 positive by my09/11 pcr only one sample was positivite for β 1 species 2.4% using fap primers six of the untyped strains clustered with sequences from species 7 9 10 812 of γ genus four sequences remained unclassified finally β and γ hpv prevalence was significantly lower than their respective hpv prevalence as identified by the luminex system in all anatomical sites that were analyzed in previous studies this study provides new information about viral isolates present in oropharyngeal site and it will contribute to improve the monitoring of hpv infection
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov spike protein is known to mediate receptor interaction and immune recognition and thus it is considered as a major target for vaccine design the spike protein plays an important role in virus entry virus receptor interactions and virus tropism sensitive diagnosis of sars is essential for the control of the disease in humans recombinant sars-cov s1 antigen was produced and purified for the development of monoclonal and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies the hybridomas secreting anti-s1 antibodies f26g18 and p136.8d12 were fused respectively with the yp4 hybridoma to generate quadromas the sandwich elisa was formed by using f26g18 as a coating antibody and biotinylated f26g18 as a detection antibody with a detection limit of 0.037 g/ml p < 0.02 the same detection limit was found with p136.8d12 as a coating antibody and biotinylated f26g18 as a detection antibody the sensitivity was improved detection limit of 0.019 g/ml however when using bi-specific monoclonal antibody f157 as the detection antibody in conclusion the method described in this study allows sensitive detection of a recombinant sars spike protein by sandwich elisa with bi-specific monoclonal antibody and could be used for the diagnosis of patients suspected with sars
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is one of the most important infectious agents for the swine industry worldwide zinc zn salts which are widely used as a dietary supplement in swine nutrition have shown antiviral effects in vitro as well as in vivo the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of dietary zinc oxide supplementation on vaccination and challenge infection with prrsv findings the clinical course of prrs and the success of vaccination with an experimental inactivated vaccine were compared between animals receiving a conventional diet 50 ppm zn control group and diets supplemented with zn oxide zno at final zn concentrations of 150 or 2500 ppm pigs receiving higher dietary zn levels showed a tendency towards higher neutralizing antibody levels after infection while dietary zn levels did not substantially influence the number of antiviral ifn-gamma secreting cells ifn-gamma-sc or percentages of blood immune cell subsets after infection finally feeding higher dietary zn levels reduced neither clinical symptoms nor viral loads conclusions our results suggest that higher levels of dietary zno do not have the potential to stimulate or modulate systemic immune responses after vaccination and heterologous prrsv infection to an extent that could improve the clinical and virological outcome
the protective use of plasma powder from cattle and swine against experimentally induced neonatal e coli diarrhoea in colostrum-deprived calves was examined diarrhoea was induced with a strain expressing f5 + fimbriae and a strain expressing f17 + fimbriae in all groups supplemented with bovine plasma powder diarrhoea and fever were less severe than in the control groups for the groups infected with the f5 + e coli strain a reduction in excretion of the challenge strain by 2-4 orders of magnitude and by 1-2 orders of magnitude was seen when supplemented with bovine plasma powder at a dose of 25 g/l milk and 10 g/l milk respectively the bovine plasma powder showed also beneficial effects in the f17 + infected groups no mortality no septicaemia and no severe clinical signs were observed concerning the excretion of the e coli f17 + strain in the faeces no significant difference with the control group was found swine plasma powder showed little beneficial effect on e coli diarrhoea in calves in this study
most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin yet while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes either exclusively humans or exclusively animals without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases
the human coronavirus hcov-oc43 causes a significant fraction of upper respiratory tract infections most coronaviruses show a strong species specificity although the sars-coronavirus crossed species from palm civet cats to infect humans similarly hcov-oc43 likely a member of the same coronavirus group as sars-cov readily crossed the species barrier as evidenced by its rapid adaptation to the murine brain . herein we investigated two consequences of this plasticity in species tropism first we showed that hcov-oc43 was able to infect cells from a large number of mammalian species second we showed that virus that was passed exclusively in suckling mouse brains was highly virulent and caused a uniformly fatal encephalitis in adult mice the surface glycoprotein is a major virulence factor in most coronavirus infections we identified three changes in the hcov-oc43 surface glycoprotein that correlated with enhanced neurovirulence in mice these were located in the domain of the protein responsible for binding to host cells these data suggest that some coronaviruses including hcov-oc43 and sars-cov readily adapt to growth in cells from heterologous species this adaptability has facilitated the isolation of hcov-oc43 viral variants with markedly differing abilities to infect animals and tissue culture cells
using incipient lines of the collaborative cross cc a murine genetic reference population we previously identified a quantitative trait loci qtl associated with low sars-cov titer in this study we integrated sequence information and rna expression of genes within the qtl to identify mucin 4 muc4 as a high priority candidate for controlling sars-cov titer in the lung to test this hypothesis we infected muc4 -/mice and found that female but not male muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with sars-cov femalemuc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology however no change in viral titers was observed comparing across viral families studies with chikungunya virus a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus suggests that muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread although not confirming the original titer qtl our data identifies a role for muc4 in the sars-cov disease and viral pathogenesis given the recent emergence of sars-cov-2 this work suggest that muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following sars-cov infection with the sars-cov-2 outbreak continuing treatments that modulate or enhance muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes in addition the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv infection on the development of the immune response after pseudorabies virus prv vaccination in pigs pigs were intranasally inoculated with the european prrsv strain lelystad virus ter huurne and were vaccinated intramuscularly with prv 2 weeks later lv-prv group control pigs were vaccinated with prv only prv group eight weeks after prv vaccination pigs from both groups were challenged intranasally with wild-type prv we measured the lymphoproliferative and the cytolytic responses to prv of peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc isolated from blood samples in addition serum samples were examined for antibodies against prv and lv one week after prv vaccination pbmc proliferated abundantly to prv in both groups however in the lv-prv group the lymphoproliferative response declined after 1 week whereas in the prv group the lymphoproliferative response was high for 3 weeks and declined thereafter p<0.05 after challenge the lymphoproliferative response was 1 week earlier and was consistently and signi®cantly higher in the prv group than in the lv-prv group the prv-speci®c killing was higher at 3 weeks after prv vaccination and 5 weeks after prv challenge 19ae3 and 24ae6% respectively in the prv group compared to 7ae4 and 6ae9% respectively in the lv-prv group p<0.05 however later after vaccination and challenge the cytolytic response was identical in both groups the antibody titre against prv developed equally in both groups after challenge no prv virus was isolated from both groups from these results we conclude that although prrsv infection did cause changes in the time course of the t-lymphocyte response after prv vaccination prrsv infection did not inhibit the development of vaccine-induced protection after prv #
andes virus andv is associated with a lethal vascular leak syndrome in humans termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps the mechanism for the massive vascular leakage associated with hps is poorly understood however dysregulation of components of the immune response is often suggested as a possible cause alveolar macrophages are found in the alveoli of the lung and represent the first line of defense to many airborne pathogens to determine whether alveolar macrophages play a role in hps pathogenesis alveolar macrophages were depleted in an adult rodent model of hps that closely resembles human hps syrian hamsters were treated intratracheally with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes or control liposomes and were then challenged with andv treatment with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes resulted in significant reduction in alveolar macrophages but depletion did not prevent pathogenesis or prolong disease depletion also did not significantly reduce the amount of virus in the lung of andv-infected hamsters but altered neutrophil recruitment mip-1␣ and mip-2 chemokine expression and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf levels in hamster bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid early after intranasal challenge these data demonstrate that alveolar macrophages may play a limited protective role early after exposure to aerosolized andv but do not directly contribute to hantavirus disease pathogenesis in the hamster model of hps hantaviruses continue to cause disease worldwide for which there are no fda-licensed vaccines effective postexposure prophylactics or therapeutics much of this can be attributed to a poor understanding of the mechanism of hantavirus disease pathogenesis hantavirus disease has long been considered an immune-mediated disease however by directly manipulating the syrian hamster model we continue to eliminate individual immune cell types as the most numerous immune cells present in the respiratory tract alveolar macrophages are poised to defend against hantavirus infection but those antiviral responses may also contribute to hantavirus disease here we demonstrate that like in our prior t and b cell studies alveolar macrophages neither prevent hantavirus infection nor cause hantavirus disease while these studies reflect pathogenesis in the hamster model they should help us rule out specific cell types and prompt us to consider other potential mechanisms of disease in an effort to improve the outcome of human hps
dog circovirus dogcv was identified in an outbreak of enteritis in pups in italy the disease was observed in 6 young dachshunds pups of a litter from a breeding kennel and caused the death of 2 dogs upon full-genome analysis the virus detected in one of the dead pups strain bari/411-13 was closely related to dogcvs that have been recently isolated in the usa the present study if corroborated by further reports could represent a useful contribution to the knowledge of the pathogenic potential of dogcv and its association with enteritis in dogs citation decaro n
the nursery industry pasteurizes soil with steam and quicklime to reduce plant pathogens the mechanism of action for quicklime is the resulting exothermic reaction that occurs when the chemical interacts with water and its ability to increase ph levels these treatments may also reduce pathogens in a commercial poultry house in this study a steam sterilization cart simulated conditions used by the nursery industry to treat litter inoculated with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium a homogenized sample of litter was exposed to steam for 0 5 30 or 120 min quicklime was used at concentrations of 0 control 2.5 5.0 or 10.0%. all steam treatments with or without quicklime significantly reduced salmonella typhimurium colonization by at least 3 orders of magnitude significant reductions were also observed in the treatments with quicklime alone both the steam and the quicklime treatments often reduced colonization to undetectable levels even when samples were enriched therefore we demonstrated 2 novel techniques for reducing salmonella typhimurium in poultry litter soil pasteurization potentially offers an environmentally sound means of reducing the pathogens present in used poultry litter
cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main causes of diarrhea in neonatal calves resulting in significant morbidity and economic losses for producers worldwide we have previously demonstrated efficacy of a new class of antimicrobial antibody fusions in a neonatal mouse model for c parvum infection here we extend efficacy testing of these products to experimental infection in calves the principal target species neonatal calves were challenged with c parvum oocysts and concomitantly treated with antibody-biocide fusion 4h9-g1-ll37 over the course of four days this resulted in reduced severity of the disease when compared to control animals overall clinical health parameters showed significant improvement in treated animals oocyst shedding was reduced in treated when compared to control animals control of oocyst shedding is a prerequisite for breaking the cycle of re-infection on dairy farms antibody-biocide fusion products thus have the potential to reduce the impact of the infection in both individual animals and in the herd
background studies suggest that intranasal vaccination can stimulate nonspecific immunity against agents not contained within the vaccine but this effect is not reported for cats hypothesis a modified live feline herpesvirus-1 fhv-1 and feline calicivirus fcv intranasal vaccine will reduce clinical signs of disease caused by experimental infection with bordetella bronchiseptica animals twenty specific pathogen-free 12-week-old kittens methods experimental study cats were randomized into 2 groups of 10 cats each the vaccinated group was administered a single intranasal dose of a commercially available vaccine containing modified live strains of fhv-1 and fcv and the control group remained unvaccinated all 20 cats were administered b bronchiseptica by nasal inoculation 7 days later and were observed daily for clinical signs of illness for 20 days results in the first 10 days after b bronchiseptica challenge vaccinated cats were less likely to be clinically ill than control cats with a median clinical score of 0/180 range 0-5 versus 2/180 range 0-8 p = .01 nine of 10 control cats and 2 of 10 vaccinated cats were recorded as sneezing during days 1-10 after challenge p = .006 conclusions and clinical importance intranasal vaccination against fhv-1 and fcv decreased signs of illness due to an infectious agent not contained in the vaccine this nonspecific immunity could be beneficial for protection against organisms for which vaccines are not available and as protection before development of vaccine-induced humoral immunity
in this chapter cross-species infections from bats to humans are reviewed that do or do not use intermediate animal ampli fi cation hosts and that lead to humanhuman transmissions with various ef fi ciencies rabies infections hendra virus infections in australia nipah virus infections in malaysia and bangladesh and sars coronavirus infection in china are explored from the public health perspective factors of bat biology are discussed which make them ideal virus reservoirs for emerging diseases in line with the book theme it is asked whether even in these epidemic conditions viruses can be seen as essential agents of life where host species use their viruses to defend their ecological position against intruders it is asked whether another essential function of animal viral infections could be the "killing the winning population" phenomenon known from phage biology which would stabilize species diversity in nature
after human coronaviruses oc43 229e and nl63 human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 is the fourth human coronavirus discovered hcov-hku1 is a group 2a coronavirus that is still not cultivable the g + c contents of hcov-hku1 genomes are 32% the lowest among all known coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available among all coronaviruses hcov-hku1 shows the most extreme codon usage bias attributed most importantly to severe cytosine deamination all hcov-hku1 genomes contain unique tandem copies of a 30-base acidic tandem repeat of unknown function at the n-terminus of nsp3 inside the acidic domain upstream of papain-like protease 1 three genotypes a b and c of hcov-hku1 and homologous recombination among their genomes are observed the incidence of hcov-hku1 infections is the highest in winter similar to other human coronaviruses hcov-hku1 infections have been reported globally with a median range incidence of 0.9 0 -4.4 %. hcov-hku1 is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections that are mostly selflimiting the most common method for diagnosing hcov-hku1 infection is rt-pcr or real-time rt-pcr using rna extracted from respiratory tract samples such as nasopharyngeal aspirates npa both the pol and nucleocapsid genes have been used as the targets for amplification monoclonal antibodies have been generated for direct antigen detection in npa for antibody detection escherichia coli bl21 and baculovirus-viruses 2009 1 58 expressed recombinant nucleocapsid of hcov-hku1 have been used for igg and igm detection in sera of patients and normal individuals using western blot and enzyme-linked immunoassay
despite many reports on the shedding of giardia parasites by scouring calves the role of giardia as a cause of calf diarrhea is still controversial to elucidate the role of giardia duodenalis in calf scours diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage e g duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis our data suggest that under certain circumstances giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours gnotobiotic calf-based infectivity studies are needed if the pathogenicity of giardia in calves is to be definitively determined #
since there is no available serological methods to detect antibodies to ferret coronavirus frcov an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using recombinant partial nucleocapsid n proteins of the ferret coronavirus frcov yamaguchi-1 strain was developed to establish a serological method for detection of frcov infection many serum samples collected from ferrets recognized both a a 1-179 and a a 180-374 of the n protein but two serum samples did not a a 180-374 of the n protein this different reactivity was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the serum from the ferret therefore the a a 1-179 of the n protein was used as an elisa antigen serological test was carried out using sera or plasma of ferrets in japan surprisingly 89% ferrets in japan had been infected with frcov these results indicated that our established elisa using a a 1-179 of the n protein is useful for detection of antibody to frcov for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of frcov infection key words enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa ferret coronavirus frcov nucleocapsid n
attenuated salmonella typhimurium was selected as a transgenic vehicle for the development of live mucosal vaccines against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev a 2.2 kb dna fragment encoding for n-terminal domain glycoprotein s of tgev was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pvax1 the recombinant plasmid pvax-s was transformed by electroporation into attenuated s typhimurium sl7207 the expression and translation of the pvax-s delivered by recombinant s typhimurium sl7207 pvax-s was detected in vitro and in vivo respectively balb/c mice were inoculated orally with sl7207 pvax-s at different dosages the bacterium was safe to mice at dosage of 2 × 10 9 cfu and eventually eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization mice immunized with different dosages of sl7207 pvax-s elicited specific anti-tgev local mucosal and humoral responses as measured by indirect elisa assay moreover the immunogenicity of the dna vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration 10 9 cfu dosage group showed higher antibody response than 10 8 cfu and 10 7 cfu dosages groups during week 4-8 post-immunization the results indicated that attenuated s typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of tgev dna vaccine
a novel influenza a virus emerged in early 2009 to cause the first influenza pandemic of the 21 st century understanding the evolution of influenza virus is crucial to determine pathogenesis vaccine efficacy and resistance to antiviral drugs in this study we investigated the molecular evolution of influenza virus ah1n1pdm09 in the 2010/11 influenza season in southern germany by sequence analysis of the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene from 25 patients with mild moderate and severe disease phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of different genetic groups the d222g mutation which had previously been observed in severe cases was not detected immunocompromised patients were not affected more severely than non-immunocompromised patients p[0.05 although longer shedding was observed in some of them interestingly additional mutations and potential glycosylation sites were detected in samples from the lower respiratory tract in two patients but not in the corresponding upper respiratory tract specimens the h275y mutation in the influenza virus neuraminidase gene known to confer resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir was detected in one patient
the persistent public health threat of infection with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov highlights the need for an effective and safe mers-cov vaccine in this study we prepared and vaccinated mice with either a spike s protein or inactivated whole mers-cov iv with a combined adjuvant alum+cpg as a vaccine formulation similar levels of the anti-s protein igg response and neutralizing activity were induced by both the s protein and iv vaccines in addition immune responses against three other structural proteins the envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins were also detected in sera of mice that received iv no antigen-specific t-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-γ elispot assay mice were transduced with ad5-hdpp4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with mers-cov 1 × 10 5 plaque-forming units compared with the control group adjuvant alone mice immunized with the s protein or iv showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers mice that received iv formulations also showed increased protective immunity almost no live virus was isolated from the lung in conclusion our data indicate that immunization with our iv formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to immunization with the s protein against mers-cov which should be further tested in camels and clinical trials
cohorts of pre-weaned calves were studied for cryptosporidium infection over three successive years 201020112012 in one beef cattle herd in western france each year 25-34 calves were sampled weekly from 3 days to one month of age in order to characterize oocyst output cryptosporidium species and clinical features associated with infection faecal samples were screened for the presence of oocysts using immunofluorescence analysis dna was extracted from positive samples and a pcr ssu rrna followed by rflp or sequencing was performed for the subtyping of c parvum a gp60 pcr was carried out regardless of the year 92-100% of the animals excreted oocysts on at least one sampling date depending on the year of observation the age of highest prevalence varied in contrast the peak of excretion was systematically observed almost at the same age 2nd-3rd week of life with excretion levels ranging from between 100 and 1.7 × 10 7 oocysts/g of faeces differences concerning clinical signs depending on the year of sampling were observed different species patterns were observed with a predominance of c bovis in the 1st year and a predominance of c parvum in the last year moreover two zoonotic subtypes of c parvum iiaa15g2r1 and iiaa18g2r1 were recorded in different years this study shows that in a given farm the cryptosporidium species and c parvum subtypes identified as well as the prevalence of infection and level of excretion may vary greatly and show distinct patterns according to the year
bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin we characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species which were sampled in three locations of yunnan province by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays and next-generation sequencing seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by rt-pcr using degenerate primers and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera rubulavirus henipavirus and jeilongvirus various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using illumina sequencing a total of 7066 assembled contigs ≥200 bp were constructed and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families 1 insect virus and 1 mycovirus 17 were parasites and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms among theviruses 2014 6 2139 103 vertebrate viral contigs 79 displayed low identity <70% to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses overall the most frequently identified viruses particularly in bats from the family hipposideridae were retroviruses the present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in yunnan china and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans
the last decade has witnessed the emergence of several new viral infectious agents most notably avian influenza h5n1 sars and west nile virus the emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors the environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence we suggest that cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites including giardia could be a a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and b a source of zoonoses through infection of the 'target' animal including humans one example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsrna from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsrna viral-like particles the importance of such a surrogate relationship is discussed and its implications for human and animal health highlighted ª a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / b i h y bioscience hypotheses 2009 2 363e369
using recombination analysis we identified a recombinant dengue virus type 1 strain namely gd23/95 with three recombination regions located within the sequences of the prm/e junction ns1 and ns3 respectively the recombinant dengue virus was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on its recombination and non-recombination regions this appears to be the first study to confirm the existence of three recombination regions in a single dengue virus isolate and to report recombination between parent virus strains isolated from the same geographic area guangdong province china it is also the first to report breakpoints within the ns3 gene of dengue viruses both dengue fever df and dengue hemorrhagic fever/ dengue shock syndrome dhf/dss are severe arboviral diseases caused by dengue viruses denv with more than 100 million cases of infection and estimated 25000 deaths recorded annually around the world . denv belongs to the genus flavivirus of the family flaviviridae there are four distinct serotypes of denv-denv1 denv2 denv3 and denv4 the dengue virus genome is a singlestranded positive-sense rna virus of approximately 11 kb that encodes three structural proteins c prm and e and
a key goal for hiv-1 envelope immunogen design is the induction of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies nabs as aids vaccine recipients will not be exposed to strains exactly matching any immunogens due to multiple hiv-1 quasispecies circulating in the human population worldwide heterologous shiv challenges are essential for realistic vaccine efficacy testing in primates we assessed whether polyclonal igg isolated from rhesus monkeys rms with high-titer nabs termed shivig could protect rms against the r5-tropic tier-2 shiv-2873nip which was heterologous to the viruses or hiv-1 envelopes that had elicited shivig results shivig demonstrated binding to hiv gag tat and env of different clades and competed with the broadly neutralizing antibodies b12 vrc01 4e10 and 17b shivig neutralized tier 1 and tier 2 viruses including shiv-2873nip nk-cell depletion decreased the neutralizing activity of shivig 20-fold in pbmc assays although shivig neutralized shiv-2873nip in vitro this polyclonal igg preparation failed to prevent acquisition after repeated intrarectal low-dose virus challenges but at a dose of 400 mg/kg it significantly lowered peak viremia p = 0.001 unexpectedly single-genome analysis revealed a higher number of transmitted variants at the low dose of 25 mg/kg implying increased acquisition at low shivig levels in vitro shivig demonstrated complement-mediated ab-dependent enhancement of infection c'-ade at concentrations similar to those observed in plasmas of rms treated with 25 mg/kg of shivig conclusion our primate model data suggest a dual role for polyclonal anti-hiv-1 abs depending on plasma levels upon virus encounter
coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in normal and diarrhea stool specimens from baboons chimpanzees macaques and marmosets there was a high prevalence of particles in both normal and diarrhea stools of older animals whereas stools from nonweaned animals rarely contained these coronavirus-like particles
effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses however little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-ncov is available we used the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses including sars-cov which has high sequence similarity to 2019-ncov and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses we identified multiple specific regions in 2019-ncov that have high homology to sars virus parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential b and t cell epitopes for 2019-ncov the independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-ncov we identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-ncov and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates

björkman c svensson c christensson b de verdier k cryptosporidium parvum and giardia intestinalis in calf diarrhoea in sweden acta vet scand 2003 44 145-152.-the objective of this study conducted in 75 herds was to investigate the presence and significance of cryptosporidium parvum and giardia intestinalis in swedish dairy calves in comparison with rotavirus coronavirus and escherichia coli k99+. the farmers were asked to collect faecal samples from each heifer calf that had diarrhoea between birth and 90 days of age and also from a healthy calf of the same age in total 270 samples were collected and analysed c parvum either alone or together with g intestinalis and/or rotavirus was detected in 16 11% and 6 5% of the samples from diarrhoeic and healthy calves respectively even though a higher proportion of diarrhoeic calves shed c parvum the difference between the groups was not statistically significant p=0.067 possibly due to the low number of positive samples g intestinalis was found in 42 29% of the diarrhoea samples and in 29 23% of the samples from healthy calves rotavirus and coronavirus were demonstrated in 24% and 3% of the diarrhoea samples respectively whereas e coli k99+ was only found in samples from 2 healthy calves c parvum and g intestinalis were found in samples from calves 7 to 84 days of age and during all seasons the results confirm that c parvum is present in swedish dairy herds and might have clinical significance g intestinalis was the most common agent found but the importance of this parasite remains unclear both parasites have suggested zoonotic potential and thus warrant further attention in addition rotavirus is a major pathogen in neonatal enteritis in sweden whereas coronavirus and e coli k99+ seem to be of less importance figure 1 . distribution of infectious agents in diarrhoeic and healthy calves n=268 younger than 3 months of age in 75 swedish dairy herds
intramuscular im immunization is generally considered incapable of generating a protective mucosal immune response in the swine industry attempts to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling porcine epidemic diarrhea ped via an im route of administration have been unsuccessful in the present study porcine chemokine ligand proteins ccl25 27 and 28 were constructed and stably expressed in the mammalian expression system im co-administration of inactivated pedv ipedv particles with different cc chemokines and freund's adjuvants resulted in recruiting ccr9+ and/or ccr10+ inflammatory cells to the injection site thereby inducing superior systemic pedv specific igg fecal iga and viral neutralizing antibodies in pigs moreover pigs immunized with ipedv in combination with ccl25 and ccl28 elicited substantial protection against a virulent pedv challenge we show that the porcine cc chemokines could be novel adjuvants for developing im vaccines for modulating mucosal immune responses against mucosal transmissible pathogens in pigs vaccines 2020 8 102 2 of 16 immunization region to mucosal sites . on the other hand the ccl25/teck expressed by mucosal epithelial cells can chemo-attract ccr9+ cells and support ccr9 expression leukocytes to migrate to the small intestine . the application of ccl27 and ccl25 as an adjuvant in dna vaccines was proven to enhance systemic and/or mucosal immune responses following im injection in mice or macaques . therefore the incorporation of these cc chemokines as immune trafficking signals could be a potential strategy for the development of effective parenteral pedv vaccine regimens in the present study three porcine ccl proteins namely ccl27 ccl28 and ccl25 were constructed and stably expressed in the mammalian cell expression system different combinations of these chemokines were intramuscularly co-administrated with inactivated pedv ipedv viral particles and freund's adjuvant in pigs immunohistochemical ihc staining was performed to detect the infiltration of cognate chemokine receptors ccr9+ or ccr10+ bearing immune cells to the sites of immunization the immunogenicity and protective efficiency of ipedv adjuvanted with freund's adjuvant in different combinations of cc chemokines were evaluated in 5-week-old pigs
bats are reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic agents including lyssa- henipah- sars-like corona- marburg- ebola- and astroviruses in an effort to survey for the presence of other infectious agents known and unknown we screened sera from 16 pteropus giganteus bats from faridpur bangladesh using high-throughput pyrosequencing sequence analyses indicated the presence of a previously undescribed virus that has approximately 50% identity at the amino acid level to gb virus a and c gbv-a and -c viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 sera 5% from a single colony of free-ranging bats infection was not associated with evidence of hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction phylogenetic analysis indicates that this first gbv-like flavivirus reported in bats constitutes a distinct species within the flaviviridae family and is ancestral to the gbv-a and -c virus clades
background porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a syndrome that is characterized by rapidly spreading watery diarrhea affecting pigs of all ages but with major effects on suckling piglets the disease as well as the causative alphacoronavirus the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was first described in europe in the 1970s and since then has spread over many asian and american countries where it recently led to devastating effects on swine health and pork industry while the disease was seldom reported in europe within the last few decades a few recent reports re-emergence of ped in german pig farms the hitherto isolated german strain seems to be closely related to a low pathogenic pedv variant from the usa this case report describes the first detection of pedv in austria case presentation reduced feed uptake and occasional diarrhea were observed in december 2014 in a group of fattening pigs kept on an austrian swine farm the concerned pigs had been recently purchased from germany within a few weeks diarrhea became apparent also in pigs of austrian origin which were kept in a different stable on the same farm gastrointestinal symptoms among fattening pigs were generally mild quickly resolving and did not lead to death pedv rna was identified by rt-qpcr in pooled feces and serum and pedv antibodies were detectable in serum in both groups of pigs phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete pedv spike gene shows that the austrian pedv strain is highly similar to other strains involved in recent outbreaks in western and central europe conclusion this is the first report demonstrating the presence of pedv in austria the virus was probably introduced by purchasing piglets from a german source which underlines the significance of trans-boundary animal trade for the distribution of highly contagious diseases such as ped
transcutaneous immunization tci is a non-invasive and easy-to-use vaccination method we demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a transcutaneous vaccine formulation using a hydrogel patch in animal experiments in the present study we performed a clinical study to apply our tci formulation for vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria in human the tci device was a hydrogel patch antigen-free applied to the left brachial medial skin of 22 healthy volunteers for 48 h next the hydrogel patch containing 2 mg tetanus toxoid tt and 2 mg diphtheria toxoid dt as the tci formulation was applied to 27 healthy volunteers for 24 h and some volunteers were vaccinated again by tci formulation for safety assessment the patch application site was observed to assess local adverse events and systemic adverse events were determined by a blood test the antigen-free hydrogel patch and tci formulation containing tt and dt did not induce local or systemic severe adverse events for vaccine efficacy estimation toxoid-specific serum antibody titers were determined by elisa and the toxin-neutralizing activity of the induced antibody was evaluated in a passive-challenge experiment the anti-tt igg titer and the anti-dt igg titer increased and a significant effect was detected by paired t-test the antibody titers were maintained at higher level than that before vaccination for at least 1 year moreover toxoid-specific antibodies were produced by the second vaccination in some subjects antibodies induced by application of the tci formulation neutralized the toxin and prevented toxic death in mice in addition changes in the skin condition due to application of the tci formulation were observed under in vivo confocal raman spectroscopy the amount of water and patch components in the stratum corneum increased after application of the tci formulation suggesting that the change in the skin condition was related to antigen penetration these data indicate that this easy-to-use tci system induces an immune response without severe adverse reactions in humans this easy-to-use and safe tci formulation enables mass treatment in an outbreak setting and increased vaccination rates in developing countries and will greatly contribute to worldwide countermeasures against infectious diseases
in vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence and although the precise mechanisms are not clear it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity under-or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence the objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population malnutrition and obesity sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species guinea pigs viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling histopathology viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species additionally nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population in particular an n1124d change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals in vivo comparison of an 1124d plaque isolate to a clone with 1124n genotype indicated that 1124d was associated with increased virulence
flaviviruses continue to cause globally relevant epidemics and have emerged or re-emerged in regions that were previously unaffected factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood here we identify potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks we evaluate variability in wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct clusters with similar hosts models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host characteristics the combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease surveillance in animals and humans
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses hpaivs of subtype h5 are a major threat for poultry holdings worldwide here especially the zoonotic asian h5n1 viruses these hpaivs have caused more than 500 fatal spillover infections from poultry to humans with a looming danger of a new pandemic by establishing human-to-human transmissions besides culling measures in infected farms in endemic areas vaccination is the major tool against hpaiv however the mainly used inactivated preparations have several limitations like application to the individual animal by injection and a reduced efficiency here we present a modified live influenza vaccine prototype which is based on the h17n10 bat influenza virus the new chimeric vaccine strain r65 mono /h17n10 was able to provide full protection against a lethal challenge infection with hpaiv h5n1 of juvenile and subadult chickens as well as ferrets after oronasal immunization in addition the h5 vaccine prototype cannot reassort with avian influenza viruses and therefore is a promising tool against hpaiv h5 infection allowing new vaccination strategies for efficient disease control npj vaccines 2020 540 https//doi
the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries the sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for sars-cov-2 therefore vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need this study took immune-informatics approaches to identify b-and t-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein s of sars-cov-2 followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen hla alleles we identified four b cell epitopes two mhc class-i and nine mhc class-ii binding t-cell epitopes which showed highly antigenic features allergenicity toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes the stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis no mutations were observed in all the selected b-and t-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development
the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a serious threat to 25 global public health and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society the 26 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 can cause 27 severe respiratory illness and death currently there are no specific antiviral drugs 28 that can treat covid-19 several vaccines against sars-cov-2 are being actively 29 developed by research groups around the world the surface s spike protein and the 30 highly expressed internal n nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-2 are widely 31 considered as promising candidates for vaccines in order to guide the design of an 32 effective vaccine we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates in 33 this study we mapped the immunodominant id sites of s protein using sera samples 34 collected from recently discharged covid-19 patients the sars-cov-2 s protein-35 specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered covid-19 patients were strongly 36 correlated with the neutralising antibody titres we used epitope mapping to 37 determine the landscape of id sites of s protein which identified nine linearized b 38 cell id sites four out of the nine id sites were found in the receptor-binding domain 39 rbd further analysis showed that these id sites are potential high-affinity sars-40 cov-2 antibody binding sites peptides containing two out of the nine sites were 41 tested as vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 in a mouse model we detected 42 epitope-specific antibodies and sars-cov-2-neutralising activity in the immunised 43 mice this study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of 44 vaccines against covid-19.45 46
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is a widespread zoonotic viral disease caused by a tick-born virus crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv this disease is endemic in middle east asia africa and south-eastern europe with the mortality rate of 5-30%. cchfv genome is composed of three segments large medium and small segments m segment encodes a polyprotein glycoprotein so called glycoprotein n gn which is considered as a potential druggable target for the effective therapy of cchf the complete structure of gn is still not characterized the aim of the current study is to predict the complete three-dimensional 3d- structure of cchfv gn protein via threading-based modeling and investigate the residues crucial for binding with cchfv envelop the developed model displayed excellent stereo-chemical and geometrical properties subsequently structure based virtual screening sbvs was applied to discover novel inhibitors of gn protein a library of > 1300 anti-virals was selected from pubchem database and directed to the predicted binding site of gn the sbvs results led to the identification of thirty-seven compounds that inhibit the protein in computational analysis those 37 hits were subject to pharmacokinetic profiling which demonstrated that 30/37 compound possess safer pharmacokinetic properties thus by specifically targeting gn less toxic and more potent inhibitors of cchfv were identified in silico
human metapneumovirus hmpv is an important human pathogen that along with respiratory syncytial virus rsv is a major cause of respiratory tract infections in young infants development of an effective vaccine against pneumoviruses has proven to be particularly difficult despite over 50 years of research in this field no vaccine against hmpv or rsv is currently available recombinant chimeric viruses expressing antigens of other viruses can be generated by reverse genetics and used for simultaneous immunization against more than one pathogen this approach can result in the development of promising vaccine candidates against hmpv and several studies have indeed validated viral vectors expressing hmpv antigens in this review we summarize current efforts in generating recombinant chimeric vaccines against hmpv and we discuss their potential optimization based on the correspondence with rsv studies
the mechanism of brain infection with mouse hepatitis virus-jhm was studied in balb/cbyj mice following intranasal inoculation and found to be a consequence of direct viral spread along olfactory nerves into olfactory bulbs of the brain infection was followed sequentially from nose to brain using microscopy immunohistochemistry and virus quantification lesions antigen and virus were observed in the olfactory bulb and anterior brain as early as 2 days and posterior brain by 4 days after inoculation viral antigen extended through nasal mucosa into submucosa then coursed along the olfactory nerve perineurium and fibers through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulbs on days 4 and 7 viral antigen was found in the antero-ventral brain along ventral meninges olfactory tracts and anterior ramifications of the lateral ventricles virus was cleared from nose by 10 days and anterior brain by 20 days but persisted in posterior brain for 20 days after inoculation mice also developed disseminated infection with viremia and hepatitis infection of brain did not correlate with presence of viremia in contrast to intranasally inoculated mice orally-inoculated mice did not develop encephalitis despite evidence of disseminated infection
to better understand the evolution of hepadnaviruses we sampled bats from guizhou henan and zhejiang provinces china and rodents from zhejiang province genetically diverse hepadnaviruses were identified in a broad range of bat species with an overall prevalence of 13.3%. in contrast no rodent hepadnaviruses were identified the newly discovered bat hepadnaviruses fell into two distinct phylogenetic groups the viruses within the first group exhibited high diversity with some closely related to viruses previously identified in yunnan province strikingly the newly discovered viruses sampled from jiyuan city in the second phylogenetic group were most closely related to those found in bats from west africa suggestive of a long-term association between bats and hepadnaviruses a co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species genera and families overall these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses
to investigate canine kobuvirus cakov infection fecal samples n = 59 were collected from dogs with or without diarrhea n = 21 and 38 respectively in the republic of korea rok in 2012 cakov infection was detected in four diarrheic samples 19.0 % and five non-diarrheic samples 13.2 %. all cakov-positive dogs with diarrhea were found to be infected in mixed infections with canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus or canine adenovirus there was no significant difference in the prevalence of cakov in dogs with and without diarrhea by phylogenetic analysis based on partial 3d genes and complete genome sequences the korean isolates were found to be closely related to each other regardless of whether they were associated with diarrhea and to the canine kobuviruses identified in the usa and uk this study supports the conclusion that cakovs from different countries are not restricted geographically and belong to a single lineage
the tent-making bat hepatitis b virus tbhbv is a hepadnavirus closely related to human hepatitis b virus the ecology of tbhbv is unclear we show that it is widespread and highly diversified in peters' tentmaking bats uroderma bilobatum within panama while local prevalence varied significantly between sample sites ranging from 0 to 14.3%. females showed significantly higher prevalence than males and pregnant females were more often acutely infected than non-reproductive ones the distribution of tbhbv in bats was significantly affected by forest cover with higher infection rates in areas with lower forest cover our data indicate that loss of natural habitat may lead to positive feedback on the biotic factors driving infection possibility these results underline the necessity of multidisciplinary studies for a better understanding of mechanisms in pathogen-host relationships and for predictions in disease ecology
porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped is a contagious enteric disease of pigs caused by a coronavirus a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay das-elisa based on the use of monoclonal antibodies was developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv the das-elisa was compared with rt-pcr in the examination of 506 specimens collected during 2006-2007 from pigs originating from different farms located in the po valley both faecal samples obtained directly from the rectum of live animals showing clinical signs and intestinal samples collected from the caecum of deceased pigs were included in the study the correlation between the two methods was higher when testing faecal samples k = 0.97 95% ci 0.94-1.00 than testing intestinal samples k = 0.62 95% ci 0.35-0.89 the use of elisa technology provided an efficient and effective mean of evaluating the presence of coronavirus ped antigen in field samples and indicates that this procedure is a very useful tool in epidemiological studies
background since human immunodeficiency virus hiv-infected individuals are at increased risk of severe disease from pandemic influenza a h1n1pdm09 vaccination was recommended as a prevention strategy the aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety immunogenicity and persistence of the immune response after vaccination against pandemic influenza a h1n1pdm09 with an adjuvanted vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus hiv-infected adults using two single and two double doses
recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses rvsvs are being developed as potential hiv-1 vaccine candidates to characterize the in vivo replication and dissemination of rvsv vectors in mice high doses of a highly attenuated vector expressing hiv-1 gag rvsv in -n4ct9-gag1 and a prototypic reference virus rvsv in -hivgag5 were delivered intramuscularly im intranasally in or intravenously iv we used quantitative real-time rt-pcr q-pcr and standard plaque assays to measure the temporal dissemination of these viruses to various tissues following im inoculation both viruses were detected primarily at the injection site as well as in draining lymph nodes neither virus induced significant weight loss pathologic signs or evidence of neuroinvasion in contrast following in inoculation the prototypic virus was detected in all tissues tested and caused significant weight loss leading to death in administration of rvsv in -n4ct9-gag1 resulted in detection in numerous tissues brain lung nasal turbinates and lymph nodes albeit in significantly reduced levels which caused little or no weight loss nor any mortality following iv inoculation both prototypic and attenuated viruses were detected by q-pcr in all tissues tested in contrast to the prototype rvsv in -n4ct9-gag1 viral loads were significantly lower in all organs tested and no infectious virus was detected in the brain following iv inoculation despite the presence of viral rna these studies demonstrated significant differences in the biodistribution patterns of and the associated pathogenicity engendered by the prototypic and attenuated vectors in a highly susceptible host
little is known about the ecology of many of the parasites and pathogens affecting bats but host social behavior almost certainly plays an important role in bat-parasite dynamics understanding parasite dynamics for bats is important from a human public health perspective because of their role as natural reservoirs for recent high-profile emerging zoonotic pathogens e g ebola hendra and from a bat conservation perspective because of the recent emergence of white-nose syndrome wns in north america highlighting the potential population impacts of parasites and pathogens although some bat species are among the most gregarious of mammals species vary widely in terms of their social behavior and this variation could influence pathogen transmission and impacts here we review the literature on links between bat social behavior and parasite dynamics using standardized search terms in web of science we identified articles that explicitly tested or discussed links between some aspect of bat sociality and parasite transmission or host population impacts we identified social network analysis epidemiological modeling and interspecific comparative analyses as the most commonly used methods to quantify relationships between social behavior and parasite-risk in bats while wns hendra virus and arthropod ectoparasites were the most commonly studied host-parasite systems we summarize known host-parasite relationships in these three systems and propose testable hypotheses that could improve our understanding of links between host sociality and parasite-dynamics in bats
zika virus zikv a mosquito-borne flavivirus discovered in 1947 has only recently caused large outbreaks and emerged as a significant human pathogen in 2015 zikv was detected in brazil and the resulting epidemic has spread throughout the western hemisphere severe complications from zikv infection include neurological disorders such as guillain-barré syndrome in adults and a variety of fetal abnormalities including microcephaly blindness placental insufficiency and fetal demise there is an urgent need for tools and reagents to study the pathogenesis of epidemic zikv and for testing vaccines and antivirals using a reverse genetics platform we generated six zikv infectious clones and derivative viruses representing diverse temporal and geographic origins these include three versions of mr766 the prototype 1947 strain with and without a glycosylation site in the envelope protein and h/pf/2013 a 2013 human isolate from french polynesia representative of the virus introduced to brazil in the course of synthesizing a clone of a circulating brazilian strain phylogenetic studies identified two distinct zikv clades in brazil we reconstructed viable clones of strains sph2015 and beh819015 representing ancestral members of each clade we assessed recombinant virus replication binding to monoclonal antibodies and virulence in mice this panel of molecular clones and recombinant virus isolates will enable targeted studies of viral determinants of pathogenesis adaptation and evolution as well as the rational attenuation of contemporary outbreak strains to facilitate the design of vaccines and therapeutics
zika virus zikv is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has spread to more than 70 countries worldwide since 2015 despite active research there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics we have previously reported the development of various adenoviral vectored vaccine candidates chadox1 zikv with the ability to stimulate effective immunity in mice and provide protection upon a zikv challenge model using a non-adjuvanted single vaccination approach in this study we constructed various modified vaccinia ankara mva viruses to express the zikv envelope e with modifications on the precursor membrane prm or on the c-terminus envelope transmembrane domain tm similar to our chadox1 vaccine candidates mva-zikv vaccine candidates were evaluated as a non-adjuvanted single vaccination regimen against a zikv brazilian isolate using viraemia as the correlate of protection here we report the induction of a modest level of anti-zikv e antibodies by all mva vectored vaccines and sub-optimal efficacy in a zikv challenge model our results indicate the requirement of additional strategies when using mva-zikv vaccines to afford sterile protection upon a non-adjuvanted and single vaccination regime
coronaviruses can become zoonotic as in the case of covid-19 and hunting sale and consumption of wild animals in southeast asia facilitates an increased risk for such incidents we sampled and tested rodents 851 and other mammals and found betacoronavirus rna in 12 rodents the sequences belong to two separate genetic clusters and relate closely to known rodent coronaviruses detected in the region and distantly to human coronaviruses oc43 and hku1 considering close human-wildlife contact with many species in and beyond the region a better understanding of virus diversity is urgently needed for the mitigation of future risks
avian respiratory disease causes significant economic losses in commercial poultry because of the need to protect long-lived poultry against respiratory tract pathogens from an early age vaccination programs for pullets typically involve serial administration of a variety of vaccines including infectious bronchitis virus ibv newcastle disease virus ndv and infectious laryngotracheitis virus iltv often the interval between vaccinations is only a matter of weeks yet it is unknown whether the development of immunity and protection against challenge when vaccines are given in short succession occurs in these birds something known as viral interference our objective was to determine whether serially administered live attenuated vaccines against ibv ndv and iltv influence the development and longevity of immunity and protection against challenge in long-lived birds based on a typical pullet vaccination program specific-pathogen-free white leghorns were administered multiple live attenuated vaccines against ibv ndv and iltv until 16 weeks of age woa after which certain groups were challenged with ibv ndv or iltv at 20 24 28 32 and 36 woa five days post-challenge viral load clinical signs ciliostasis tracheal histopathology and antibody titers in serum and tears were evaluated we demonstrate that pullets serially administered live attenuated vaccines against ibv ndv and iltv were protected against homologous challenge with ibv ndv or iltv for at least 36 weeks and conclude that the interval between vaccinations used in this study at least 2 weeks did not interfere with protection this information is important because it shows that a typical pullet vaccination program consisting of serially administered live attenuated vaccines against multiple respiratory pathogens can result in the development of protective immunity against each disease agent
dinap an analog of a natural product the chalcone flavokawain was synthesized and characterized in this study porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is the most challenging threat to the swine industry worldwide currently commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs in pigs therefore a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for prrsv infection hence the present study evaluated the effects of dinap on the replication of vr2332 a prototype strain of type 2 prrsv initially in vitro antiviral assays against vr2332 were performed in marc-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages pams following this a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of dinap following vr2332 infection dinap inhibited vr2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations ≥0.06 mm without significant cytotoxicity consistent with these findings in the pig study dinap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following vr2332 infection as indicated by comparison of the dinap-treated groups to the untreated control nc group in addition dinap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than nc pigs notably virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with dinap taken together these results suggest that dinap has potential anti-prrsv activity and could be useful as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment drug to control prrsv infection in pigs
the contribution of circulating antibody to the protection of naïve piglets against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was evaluated using a passive antibody transfer model piglets n = 62 derived from 6 sows were assigned to one of 6 different treatments using a randomized block design which provided for allocation of all treatments to all sows' litters each treatment was designed to achieve a different level of circulating anti-pedv antibody via intraperitoneally administration of concentrated serum antibody piglets were orally inoculated with pedv usa/in/2013/19338e 1 x 10 3 tcid 50 per piglet 24 hours later and then monitored for 14 days piglets remained with their dam throughout the experiment sow milk samples piglet fecal samples and data on piglet clinical signs body weight and body temperature were collected daily fecal samples were tested by pedv real-time reverse transcriptase pcr serum colostrum and milk were tested for pedv igg iga and virusneutralizing antibody the data were evaluated for the effects of systemic pedv antibody levels on growth body temperature fecal shedding survival and antibody response the analysis showed that circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of pedv infection specifically antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster and demonstrated a higher rate of survivability than piglets without pedv antibody when combined with previous literature on pedv it can be concluded that both systemic antibodies and maternal secretory iga in milk contribute to the protection of the neonatal pig against pedv infections overall the results of this experiment suggested that passively administered circulating antibodies contributed to the protection of neonatal piglets against pedv infection
a new tentative lyssavirus lleida bat lyssavirus was found in a bent-winged bat miniopterus schreibersii in spain it does not belong to phylogroups i or ii and it seems to be more closely related to the west causasian bat virus and especially to the ikoma lyssavirus
it is a common laboratory practice to propagate viruses in cell culture while convenient these methodologies often result in unintentional genetic alterations which have lead to adaptation and even attenuation in animal models of disease an example is the attenuation of hantaviruses family bunyaviridae genus hantavirus when cultured in vitro in this case viruses propagated in the natural reservoir species cause disease in nonhuman primates that closely mimics the human disease but passaging in cell culture attenuates these viruses to the extent that do not cause any measurable disease in nonhuman primates as efforts to develop animal models progress it will be important to take into account the influences that culture in vitro may have on the virulence of viruses in this review we discuss this phenomenon in the context of past and recent examples in the published literature
viruses are considered as causative agents and contributors to lesion expression in autoimmune disease notions best supported by studies in animal model systems this review discusses relationships between virus infection and autoimmunity focusing on mechanisms by which they could induce autoreactivity the popular idea of molecular mimicry is viewed skeptically with the reviewers taking the viewpoint that viruses contribute to autoimmunity mainly by inducing several nonspecific inflammatory events that together are sufficient to trigger autoreactivity in genetically receptive hosts

after the recent summary of world health organizationauthorized research on smallpox several clinical issues remain this policy review addresses whether early hemorrhagic smallpox is disseminated intravascular coagulation and speculates about the cause of the high mortality rate among pregnant women and whether ocular smallpox is partly the result of trachoma or vitamin a deficiency the joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug clinicians should consider whether patients with smallpox should be admitted to general hospitals although an adequate supply of secondgeneration smallpox vaccine exists in the united states its use is unclear finally political and ethical forces suggest that destruction of the remaining stocks of live smallpox virus is now appropriate
orcid numbers 0000-0002-7705-714x t p resende 0000-0001-5848-0092 m saqui-salces the enteric pathogen lawsonia intracellularis is one of the main causes of diarrhea and compromised weight gain in pigs worldwide traditional cell-line cultures have been used to study l intracellularis pathogenesis however these systems fail to reproduce the epithelial changes observed in the intestines of l intracellularis-infected pigs specifically the changes in intestinal cell constitution and gene expression a more physiologically accurate and state-of-the-art model is provided by swine enteroids derived from stem cell-containing crypts from healthy pigs the objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of two-dimensional swine enteroids as in vitro models for l intracellularis infection we established both three-and two-dimensional swine enteroid cultures derived from intestinal crypts the two-dimensional swine enteroids were infected by l intracellularis in four independent experiments enteroid-infected samples were collected 3 and 7 d postinfection for analysis using real-time quantitative pcr and l intracellularis immunohistochemistry in this study we show that l intracellularis is capable of infecting and replicating intracellularly in two-dimensional swine enteroids derived from ileum
an outbreak of infectious bronchitis caused by the ibvpr03 strain of the massachusetts genotype affected h-120 vaccinated laying hens in south brazil we investigated the cross protection of the vaccine by assessing the traqueal ciliostasis virus recovery and histopathological changes typically observed in the respiratory tract although the ibvpr03 strain is s1genotyped as massachusetts with a high genomic similarity to the h-120 vaccine strains surprisingly we found no tropism or pathogenicity to the trachea in birds infected with this strain on the other hand we observed ovarian and testicle lesions here we show that despite belonging in the massachusetts genotype the ibvpr03 pathotype differs from the expected respiratory pattern causing instead marked histopathological changes in the gonads so far not associated with this group
several human monoclonal antibodies hmabs including b12 2g12 and 2f5 exhibit relatively potent and broad hiv-1 neutralizing activity however their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein env has not been successful we have hypothesized that hiv-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using "holes" absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response in the human germline b cell receptor bcr repertoire to begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12 2g12 and 2f5 as well as to x5 m44 and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively weak neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects the germline-like x5 m44 and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested envs in contrast germline-like b12 2g12 and 2f5 lacked measurable binding to envs in an elisa assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did these results provide initial evidence that env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of x5 m44 m46 and other antibodies that bind germline bcrs with much higher affinity/avidity this hypothesis if further supported by data could contribute to our understanding of how hiv-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens
although canine respiratory coronavirus crcov is an important respiratory pathogen that is prevalent in many countries only one complete genome sequence of crcov south korea strain k37 has been obtained to date genome-wide analyses and recombination have rarely been conducted as small numbers of samples and limited genomic characterization have previously prevented further analyses herein we report a unique crcov strain denoted strain bj232 derived from a crcov-positive dog with a mild respiratory infection phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome of all available coronaviruses consistently show that crcov bj232 is most closely related to human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and bcov forming a separate clade that split off early from other betacoronavirus 1 based on the phylogenetic and simplot analysis we propose that crcov-k37 was derived from genetic recombination between crcov-bj232 and bcov in detail spike s gene of crcov-k37 clustered with crcov-bj232 however orf1ab membrane m and nucleocapsid n genes were more related to bovine coronavirus bcov than crcov-b232 molecular epidemic analysis confirmed the prevalence of crcov-bj232 lineage around the world for a long time recombinant events among betacoronavirus 1 may have implications for crcov transmissibility all these findings provide further information regarding the origin of crcov
the use of live bacteria to induce an immune response to itself or to a carried vaccine component is an attractive vaccine strategy advantages of live bacterial vaccines include their mimicry of a natural infection intrinsic adjuvant properties and their possibility to be administered orally derivatives of pathogenic and non-pathogenic food related bacteria are currently being evaluated as live vaccines however pathogenic bacteria demands for attenuation to weaken its virulence the use of bacteria as vaccine delivery vehicles implies construction of recombinant strains that contain the gene cassette encoding the antigen with the increased knowledge of mucosal immunity and the availability of genetic tools for heterologous gene expression the concept of live vaccine vehicles gains renewed interest however administration of live bacterial vaccines poses some risks in addition vaccination using recombinant bacteria results in the release of live recombinant organisms into nature this places these vaccines in the debate on application of genetically modified organisms in this review we give an overview of live bacterial vaccines on the market and describe the development of new live vaccines with a focus on attenuated bacteria and food-related lactic acid bacteria furthermore we outline the safety concerns and identify the hazards associated with live bacterial vaccines and try to give some suggestions of what to consider during their development
objective to assemble infectious bronchitis virus ibv-like particles bearing the recombinant spike protein and investigate the humoral immune responses in chickens results ibv virus-like particles vlps were generated through the co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately encoding m e or the recombinant s genes the recombinant s protein was sufficiently flexible to retain the ability to selfassemble into vlps the size and morphology of the vlps were similar to authentic ibv particles in addition the immunogenicity of ibv vlps had been investigated the results demonstrated that the efficiency of the newly generated vlps was comparable to that of the inactivated m41 viruses in eliciting ibvspecific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in chickens via subcutaneous inoculation conclusions this work provides basic information for the mechanism of ibv vlp formation and develops a platform for further designing ibv vlpbased vaccines against ibv or other viruses
detection of infectious viral agents has been on the increase globally with the advent and usage of more sensitive and selective novel molecular techniques in the epidemiological study of viral diseases of economic importance to the swine industry the observation is not different for the pig-infecting member of the subfamily parvovirinae in the family parvoviridae as the application of novel molecular methods like metagenomics has brought about the detection of many other novel members of the group surprisingly the list keeps increasing day by day with some of them possessing zoonotic potentials in the last one decade not less than ten novel swine-infecting viruses have been added to the subfamily and ceaseless efforts have been in top gear to determine the occurrence and prevalence of the old and new swine parvoviruses in herds of pig-producing countries worldwide the story however is on the contrary on the african continent as there is presently a dearth of information on surveillance initiatives of the viruses among swine herds of pig-producing countries in the region timely detection and characterization of the viral pathogens is highly imperative for the implementation of effective control and prevention of its spread this review therefore presents a concise overview on the epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses globally and also provides up-to-date highlights on the reported cases of the viral agents in the african sub-region
sporothrix schenckii and associated species are agents of human and animal sporotrichosis that cause large sapronoses and zoonoses worldwide epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks leading to massive transmissions to humans early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans we explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies igg specific against sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives s brasiliensis and s schenckii enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis n = 49 healthy cats n = 19 and cats with other diseases n = 20 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-sporothrix igg exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis area under the curve 1.0 95% confidence interval 0.94-1 p<0.0001 versus controls the two sets of sporothrix antigens plos neglected tropical diseases |
endemic balkan nephropathy ebn is a kidney disease of unknown etiology limited to bulgaria rumania and former yugoslavia primary kidney tissue cultures were established as explants from tissue obtained at operations from 5 ebn patients with urinary tract tumors four out of the five biopsy specimens on extended culture incubation at 33°c yielded a coronavirus virus ebnv which was cytopathogenic for human fibroblast and vero cells in cells inoculated with ebnv cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was found using antisera for human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e as well as the porcine transmissible gastroenteric virus and avian chicken bronchitis virus in neutralization tests ebnv failed to react with antisera to these viruses using hyperimmune serum raised with ebnv positive cytoplasmic immunofluorescence was seen with cells infected with oc43 229e tgv and significantly with the kidney tissue of the biopsy specimens from the ebn patients a screen for neutralizing antibody using the ebn virus revealed that 87.2% of ebn patients on dialysis were positive also 74% of people from an endemic area were also positive while only 13.5% from outside were positive it is suggested that a coronavirus is involved in the etiology of the disease and that humans are an incidental host of a coronavirus zoonosis

background sporozoite immunization of animals and humans under a chemo-prophylactic cover of chloroquine cps-cq efficiently induces sterile protection against malaria in humans cps-cq is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites ras raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to cq chloroquine an established anti-malarial drug is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation the aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of cq during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in plasmodium berghei models methods a number of experiments in selected complimentary p berghei murine models in balb/cbyj and c57bl/6j mice was performed first the effect of cq administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by ras immunization was studied next the effect of cq on the induction of circumsporozoite cs protein-specific cd8 + t cells by immunization with p berghei parasites expressing a mutant cs protein was investigated finally a direct comparison of cps-cq to cps with mefloquine mq an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects was performed results when cq was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of ras this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory cd8 + t cells or cs protein-specific cd8 + t cells also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered replacement of cq by mq for cps immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of ifnγ producing memory t cells in the liver p = 0.01 but similar protection conclusions this study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of cq on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in p berghei malaria models alternatively the higher efficiency of cps compared to ras might be explained by an indirect effect of cq through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and therefore improved breadth of the immune response
neonatal calf diarrhea ncd is a major cause of morbidity mortality and economic losses in the beef and dairy industries this study was conducted to investigate the existence of enteric viruses in two egyptian farms with a history of recurrent diarrhea fecal samples were collected from 25 diarrheic calves rna was extracted and tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr for the presence of rotavirus norovirus astrovirus torovirus coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus overall 76 % 19/25 of samples tested positive for one or more viruses rota- noro-and astroviruses were detected in 48 % 24 % and 32 % of tested samples respectively about 37 % 7/19 of positive samples had two different viruses one-month-old calves were the group most vulnerable to infections based on phylogenetic analysis bovine rotaviruses were of genotypes g6 and g10 bovine noroviruses were in giii.2 and bovine astroviruses were in the bastv lineage 1 astrovirus sequences showed a high level nucleotide sequence similarity with the brazilian bastv sequences available in genbank we believe this is the first report of bovine norovirus and bovine astrovirus circulating among calves in egypt further epidemiological studies are recommended to investigate their presence on a wider scale to predict their association with ncd and to design appropriate diagnostic and control methods electronic supplementary material the online version of this article

background the influenza a virus subtypes h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 are the most prevalent subtypes in swine in 2003 a reassorted h1n2 swine influenza virus siv subtype appeared and became prevalent in denmark in the present study the reassortant h1n2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an "avian-like" h1n1 virus by an experimental infection study methods sequence analyses were performed of the h1n2 virus two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant h1n2 virus and an "avian-like" h1n1 virus respectively followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later measurements of hi antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time rt-pcr the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted h1n2 virus contained a european "avian-like" h1-gene and a european "swine-like" n2-gene thus being genetically distinct from most h1n2 viruses circulating in europe but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in sweden and italy sequence analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose between circulating danish "avian-like" h1n1 and h3n2 sivs infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations pigs inoculated with h1n2 exhibited nasal virus excretion for seven days peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than h1n1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level the difference however was not statistically significant pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation had a high virus load in all lung lobes after the second inoculation the nasal virus excretion was minimal there were no clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions the "avian-like" h1n2 subtype which has been established in the danish pig population at least since 2003 is a reassortant between circulating swine "avian-like" h1n1 and h3n2 the danish h1n2 has an "avian-like" h1 and differs from most other reported h1n2 viruses in europe and north america/asia which have h1-genes of human or "classical-swine" origin respectively the variant seems however also to be circulating in countries like sweden and italy the infection dynamics of the reassorted "avian-like" h1n2 is similar to the older "avian-like" h1n1 subtype
a mammalian orthoreovirus mrv strain was isolated from a pup with fatal diarrhea which had a concurrent infection by canine parvovirus type 2 the reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the s1 segment which is characteristic of mrv type 3 mrv-3 assignment of the isolated virus to mrv-3 was confirmed by type-specific rt-pcr assays targeting the s1 gene and by subsequent sequence analysis of the pcr product by phylogeny based on the s1 gene of several mrvs the isolate fell into lineage e along with the murine strain t3c9/61 and the bovine strains t3c18/61 and t3c31/59 conversely l1 sequences were found to segregate regardless of the viral type a total of 110 fecal samples 56 nasal and 31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were tested by a nested-pcr assay specific for reoviruses and no sample was found to contain mrv rna a finding that is apparently in contrast with the seroprevalence 25.77% observed in dogs #
zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization the loss of natural habitats and exposure to new hosts for coronaviruses covs broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events in this review we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these cov populations for survival amplification and possible emergence in novel hosts
transgenic plants represent an inexpensive alternative to classical fermentation systems for production of recombinant subunit vaccines transgenic potato plants were created that express the n-terminal domain of the glycoprotein s n-gs from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev containing the major antigenic sites of the protein extracts from potato tubers expressing n-gs were inoculated intraperitoneally to mice and the vaccinated mice developed serum igg specific for tgev furthermore when potato tubers expressing n-gs were fed directly to mice they developed serum antibodies specific for gs protein demonstrating the oral immunogenicity of the plant derived spike protein from tgev * transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev is the causative agent of acute diarrhea of newborn piglets that provokes high rate mortalities in affected farms protective immunity against this disease has to be developed in pregnant sows in order to confer passive protection to the piglets trough colostrum and milk neutralizing antibodies against the virus are directed mainly to glycoprotein s and relevant epitopes in neutralization have been mapped into the nterminal domain of this protein . four major antigenic sites have been described in the globular part of glycoprotein s gs of which site a is the immunodominant 21] .the protection of suckling piglets against an enteric tgev infection is based on the uptake of specific lactogenic antibodies mainly of the iga class in the milk
a b s t r a c t dna vaccination is a promising alternative strategy for developing new human and animal vaccines the massive efforts made these past 25 years to increase the immunizing potential of this kind of vaccine are still ongoing a relatively small number of studies concerning poultry have been published even though there is a need for new poultry vaccines five parameters must nevertheless be taken into account for their development the vaccine has to be very effective safe inexpensive suitable for mass vaccination and able to induce immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies when appropriate dna vaccination should meet these requirements this review describes studies in this field performed exclusively on birds chickens ducks and turkeys no evaluations of avian dna vaccine efficacy performed on mice as preliminary tests have been taken into consideration the review first describes the state of the art for dna vaccination in poultry pathogens targeted plasmids used and different routes of vaccine administration second it presents strategies designed to improve dna vaccine efficacy influence of the route of administration plasmid dose and age of birds on their first inoculation increasing plasmid uptake by host cells addition of immunomodulators optimization of plasmid backbones and codon usage association of vaccine antigens and finally heterologous prime-boost regimens the final part will indicate additional properties of dna vaccines in poultry fate of the plasmids upon inoculation immunological considerations and the use of dna vaccines for purposes other than preventing infectious diseases
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is an economically important disease to pork producers worldwide commercially both live and killed prrsv vaccines are available to control prrs but they are not always successful based on the results of mucosal immunization studies in other viral models a good mucosal vaccine may be an effective way to elicit protective immunity to control prrs outbreaks in the present study mucosal adjuvanticity of mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate mtb wcl was evaluated in pigs administered a modified live prrs virus vaccine prrs-mlv intranasally a mtb wcl mediated increase in the frequency of nk cells cd8 + and cd4 + t cells and ␥␦ t cells in pig lungs were detected importantly an increased and early generation of prrsv specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in prrs-mlv+ mtb wcl compared to pigs inoculated with vaccine alone in addition there was an increased secretion of th1 cytokines ifn␥ and il-12 that correlated with a reciprocal reduction in the production of immunosuppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf␤ as well as t-regulatory cells in pigs vaccinated with prrs-mlv+ mtb wcl further a complete rescue in arginase levels in the lungs mediated through mtb wcl was observed in pigs inoculated with prrs-mlv in conclusion mtb wcl may be a potent mucosal adjuvant for prrs-mlv in order to potentiate the anti-prrsv specific immune responses to control prrs effectively
a sudden outbreak of epidemic diarrhoea of piglets occurred in japan the principal features being watery diarrhoea dehydration and high mortality in newborn animals the microscopical lesions were villous atrophy in the small intestine the villous enterocytes being vacuolated and cuboidal in shape the villus-crypt ratio was severely reduced varying from 1 1 to 31 transmission electron microscopy showed numerous coronaviruses within the cytoplasm of enterocytes and among microvilli specific antigens of porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped virus were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes by the streptavidin-biotin sab technique infected cells which were most abundant in the villous epithelia of the jejunum and ileum were present in small numbers in the large intestine the crypt epithelia the lamina propria and peyer's patches the study suggests that the sab technique is useful for the diagnosis of ped
hepatitis c virus is considered a major public health problem infecting 2%-3% of the human population hepatitis c virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in fact hepatitis c virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available hepatitis c virus displays a narrow host species tropism naturally infecting only humans although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection to date there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis c virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic in fact due to this restricted host range a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis immune control and prophylactic vaccine development recently several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis c virus belonging to the hepaci-and pegivirus genera in small wild mammals rodents and bats and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans dogs and horses genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis c virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis c virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models in this review article we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis c virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis c virus finally we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen hcv is an enveloped positive-stranded rna virus belonging to the genus hepacivirus in the family of flaviviridae a second species
neutralizing antibody is associated with the prevention and clearance of influenza virus infection microneutralization mn and hemagglutination inhibition hi assays are currently used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against human and avian influenza viruses including h5n1 the mn assay is somewhat labor intensive while hi is a surrogate for neutralization moreover use of replication competent viruses in these assays requires biosafety level 3 bsl-3 containment therefore a neutralization assay that does not require bsl-3 facilities would be advantageous toward this goal we generated a panel of pseudotypes expressing influenza hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na and developed a pseudotype-based neutralization pn assay here we demonstrate that ha/na pseudotypes mimic release and entry of influenza virus and that the pn assay exhibits good specificity and reveals quantitative difference in neutralizing antibody titers against different h5n1 clades and subclades using immune ferret sera we demonstrated excellent correlation between the pn mn and hi assays thus we conclude that the pn assay is a sensitive and quantifiable method to measure neutralizing antibodies against diverse clades and subclades of h5n1 influenza virus
in a previous study we demonstrated that oral immunization using autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the gal-lectin lc3 fragment acnpv-lc3 of entamoeba histolytica conferred protection against ala development in hamsters in this study we determined the ability of acnpv-lc3 to protect against ala by the intramuscular route as well as the liver immune response associated with protection results showed that 55% of hamsters im immunized with acnpv-lc3 showed sterile protection against ala whereas other 20% showed reduction in the size and extent of abscesses resulting in some protection in 75% of animals compared to the sham control group levels of protection showed a linear correlation with the development and intensity of specific antiamoeba cellular and humoral responses evaluated in serum and spleen of hamsters respectively evaluation of the th1/th2 cytokine patterns expressed in the liver of hamsters showed that sterile protection was associated with the production of high levels of ifn and il-4 these results suggest that the baculovirus system is equally efficient by the intramuscular as well as the oral routes for ala protection and that the gal-lectin lc3 fragment is a highly protective antigen against hepatic amoebiasis through the local induction of ifn and il-4
viral structural proteins share a common nature of homotypic interactions that drive viral capsid formation this natural process has been mimicked in vitro through recombinant technology to generate various virus-like particles vlps and small subviral particles that exhibit similar structural and antigenic properties of their authentic viruses therefore such self-assembled polyvalent and highly immunogenic vlps and small subviral particles are excellent subunit vaccines against individual viruses such as the vlp vaccines against the hepatitis b virus human papilloma virus and hepatitis e virus which have already been in the markets in addition various antigens and epitopes can be fused with vlps small subviral particles or protein polymers forming chimeric mono- bi- or trivalent vaccines owing to their easy-production uninfectiousness and polyvalence the recombinant chimeric vaccines offer a new approach for development of safe low-cost and high efficient subunit vaccines against a single or more pathogens or diseases while the first vlp-based combination vaccine against malaria has been approved for human use many others are under development with promising future which are summarized in this commentary
throughout the world populations of scavenger birds are declining rapidly with some populations already on the brink of extinction much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues lead and other toxins despite increased monitoring of these declining populations little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species to assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in california the california condor gymnogyps californianus turkey vulture cathartes aura and golden eagle aquila chrysaetos california condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus infectious bronchitis virus mycoplasma gallisepticum avian paramyxovirus-2 west nile virus wnv and toxoplasma gondii golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus chlamydophila psittaci and toxoplasma gondii and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus chlamydophila psittaci avian paramyxovirus-1 toxoplasma gondii and wnv risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to wnv among free-flying condors this study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered california condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats aic 101.2 € wild = hatched and raised in the wild laz = raised at the los angeles zoo sdzsp = raised at san diego zoo safari park out = raised outside of california se = standard error ci = confidence interval ref = reference category

ferret and mink coronaviruses typically cause catarrhal diarrhea in ferrets and minks respectively in recent years however systemic fatal coronavirus infection has emerged in ferrets which resembles feline infectious peritonitis fip in cats fip is a highly fatal systemic disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus infection in cats despite the importance of coronavirus infections in these animals there are no effective commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these infections we have previously reported the efficacy of a protease inhibitor in cats with fip demonstrating that a virally encoded 3c-like protease 3clpro is a valid target for antiviral drug development for coronavirus infections in this study we extended our previous work on coronavirus inhibitors and investigated the structure-activity relationships of a focused library of protease inhibitors for ferret and mink 3clpro using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay we identified potent inhibitors broadly effective against feline ferret and mink coronavirus 3clpro multiple amino acid sequence analysis and modelling of 3clpro of ferret and mink coronaviruses were conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings the results of this study provide support for further research to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents for multiple coronavirus infections to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on small molecule inhibitors of ferret and mink coronaviruses
about 30 ~ of weanling rats inoculated with jhm virus developed a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis sde 3 weeks after inoculation a i from the remaining animals 5~ displayed overt neurological signs 3 6 and 8 months a i animals with and without clinical signs 6-8 months a i were morphologically examined fresh demyelinating lesions could be demonstrated in paralyzed animals viral antigen was demonstrated and infectious jhm virus could be recovered from one animal which developed clinical signs at 3 months a i in one animal with clinical onset of 8 months a i completely remyelinated areas as well as recent demyelinating lesions were observed suggesting a recurrence of the disease process remyelinated areas were also found in 40 ~ of clinically silent animals the morphology of the late onset of the demyelination was similar to that occurring in sde remyelination consisted of both cns and pns-type this animal model offers the possibility to investigate the virus-host relationship which is responsible for the induction of a demyelinating process after a long incubation period
background taiwan has been considered free from canine parvovirus type 2c cpv-2c based on the last report of canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 surveillance however since january 2015 the first report of cpv-2c in a puppy has occurred in taiwan there is currently limited information about the cpv-2c variant in taiwan in the present study we characterized the previously unidentified cpv-2c variant and investigated the distribution of cpv-2 variants in taiwan methods during january 2014 to april 2016 fecal or rectal swab samples from 99 dogs with suspected cpv-2 infection in taiwan were collected eighty-eight were identified as being either cpv-2a −2b or -2c variants positive by real-time pcr and sequence analysis results sequence analysis of the 88 isolates confirmed cpv-2c as the dominant variant 54.6 % followed by cpv-2b 26.1 % and . phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent cpv-2c variants are similar to the chinese cpv-2c strain but can be considered as novel asian cpv-2c isolates conclusion the present study provides evidence for the existence of a novel cpv-2c variant in taiwan
the avian respiratory system hosts a wide range of commensal and potential pathogenic bacteria and/or viruses that interact with each other such interactions could be either synergistic or antagonistic which subsequently determines the severity of the disease complex the intensive rearing methods of poultry are responsible for the marked increase in avian respiratory diseases worldwide the interaction between avian influenza with other pathogens can guarantee the continuous existence of other avian pathogens which represents a global concern a better understanding of the impact of the interaction between avian influenza virus and other avian respiratory pathogens provides a better insight into the respiratory disease complex in poultry and can lead to improved intervention strategies aimed at controlling virus spread
for viruses to utilize environmental vectors hard surfaces soil water for transmission physical and chemical stability is a prerequisite there are many factors including ph salinity temperature and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water equine herpesvirus type-1 ehv-1 is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids ehv-1 and recombinants of ehv-1 and ehv-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species particularly in captive settings many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures however in many cases water sources may overlap similarly in the wild equids encounter many species at waterholes in times of seasonal drought therefore we hypothesized that ehv-1 is stable in water and that water may act as a vector for ehv-1 in order to establish the conditions promoting or hindering ehv-1 longevity infectivity and genomic stability in water we exposed ehv-1 to varied water environments ph salinity temperature and turbidity in controlled experiments over 21 days the presence and infectivity of the virus was confirmed by both qpcr and cell culture experiments our results show that ehv-1 remains stable and infectious under many conditions in water for up to three weeks

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is the causative agent for a swine disease affecting the pig industry worldwide infection with prrsv leads to reproductive complications respiratory illness and weak immunity to secondary infections to better control prrsv infection novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed here in vitro gibson assembly ga of viral genomic cdna fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious prrsv in cell culture ga involves the activities of t5-exonuclease phusion polymerase and taq ligase to join overlapping cdna fragments in an isothermal condition four overlapping cdna fragments covering the entire prrsv genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the prrsv genome the assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293t and marc-145 cells supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto marc-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the ga protocol generated infectious prrsv that had similar characteristics to the parental virus this approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus by replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via ga in conclusion this study describes for the first time the use of ga as a simple yet powerful tool for generating infectious prrsv needed for studying prrsv biology and developing novel vaccines
despite the fact that vaccine resistance has been typically considered a rare phenomenon some episodes of vaccine failure have been reported with increasing frequency in intensively-raised livestock infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a widespread avian coronavirus whose control relies mainly on extensive vaccine administration unfortunately the continuous emergence of new vaccine-immunity escaping variants prompts the development of new vaccines in the present work a molecular epidemiology study was performed to evaluate the potential role of homologous vaccination in driving ibv evolution this was undertaken by assessing ibv viral rna sequences from the orf encoding the s1 portion of viral surface glycoprotein s before and after the introduction of a new live vaccine on broiler farms in northern-italy the results of several biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher pressure in the post-vaccination period natural selection was detected essentially on sites located on the protein surface within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions this evidence strongly supports the action of vaccine-induced immunity in conditioning viral evolution potentially leading to the emergence of new vaccine-escape variants the great plasticity of rapidly-evolving rna-viruses in response to human intervention which extends beyond the poultry industry is demonstrated claiming further attention due to their relevance for animal and especially human health
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by sfts virus sftsv which is a novel bunyavirus sftsv was first isolated from patients who presented with fever thrombocytopenia leukocytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction in china subsequently it was found to be widely distributed in southeast asia korea japan and vietnam sftsv can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals companion animals and humans because the case fatality rate of sfts is high 6-30% development of specific and effective treatment for sfts is required studies of potential antiviral drugs for sfts-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates while animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10 6 copies/ml favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against sftsv in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in sfts patients in japan are underway this has yet to be confirmed other drugs including hexachlorophene calcium channel blockers 2 ′ -fluoro-2 ′ -deoxycytidine caffeic acid amodiaquine and interferons have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against sftsv among them calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine one of the calcium channel blockers reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold although further research is necessary to develop sfts-specific therapy considerable progress has been achieved in this area here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against sftsv keywords severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus antiviral ribavirin favipiravir frontiers in microbiology | www frontiersin org

infectious bronchitis virus ibv infection is highly infectious respiratory disease in poultry industry with significant economic importance the prevalence of ibv in quail industry in malaysia was not well documented therefore its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown this study was to determine the susceptibility of japanese quail as one of the species in commercial poultry industry toward ibv in addition it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry moreover to the best of our knowledge it is the first experimental study on ibv inoculation in quail in this experimental study 20 quails were divided into 4 groups n 5 5 for group a b and c n 5 5 for control group the quails in group a b and c were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 ml of 10 5 eid 50 of the virus clinical signs gross lesions positive detection of virus and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these japanese quails the results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds trachea lung and kidney were subjected to onestep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection the virus was found from trachea and lung samples whereas it was absent from all kidney samples only 3 quails were found with gross lesions there was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 6 0.845 p 0.05 within the treatment groups in summary japanese quails might be susceptible to ibv
swine enteric coronavirus cov is an important group of pathogens causing diarrhea in piglets at least four kinds of swine enteric covs have been identified including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov and the emerging hku2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus peav the small intestines particularly the jejunum and ileum are the most common targets of these four covs in vivo and co-infections by these covs are frequently observed in clinically infected pigs this study was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line ipi-2i to different swine enteric covs we found that ipi-2i cells are highly susceptible to tgev pdcov and peav as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication however only a small number of cells could be infected by pedv possibly due to the heterogeneity of ipi-2i cells a homogeneous cell line designated ipi-fx obtained from ipi-2i cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions was found to be highly susceptible to pedv furthermore ipi-fx cells were also highly susceptible to tgev pdcov as well as peav thus this sub-cloned ipi-fx cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection particularly co-infections of swine enteric covs
the notion that certain animal groups disproportionately maintain and transmit viruses to humans due to broad-scale differences in ecology life history and physiology currently influences global health surveillance and research in disease ecology virology and immunology to directly test whether such "special reservoirs" of zoonoses exist we used literature searches to construct the largest existing dataset of virus-reservoir relationships consisting of the avian and mammalian reservoir hosts of 415 rna and dna viruses along with their histories of human infection reservoir host effects on the propensity of viruses to have been reported as infecting humans were rare and when present were restricted to one or two viral families the data instead support a largely host-neutral explanation for the distribution of human-infecting viruses across the animal orders studied after controlling for higher baseline viral richness in mammals versus birds the observed number of zoonoses per animal order increased as a function of their species richness animal orders of established importance as zoonotic reservoirs including bats and rodents were unexceptional maintaining numbers of zoonoses that closely matched expectations for mammalian groups of their size our findings show that variation in the frequency of zoonoses among animal orders can be explained without invoking special ecological or immunological relationships between hosts and viruses pointing to a need to reconsider current approaches aimed at finding and predicting novel zoonoses infectious disease | reservoir | surveillance | generalized additive model
this study showed that the most of the coronaviruses covs detected in brazilian wild birds clustered with the mouse hepatitis virus a59 strain belonging to the betacov group furthermore cov detected in two different bird species amazona vinacea and brotogeris tirica clustered with a cov isolated from sparrow spacov hku17 belonging to a monophyletic group related with the covs isolated from swines porcov hku15 both belonging to the deltacov genus previously unreported in south america considering the risk of inter-species host switching and further adaptation to new hosts detection in bird species of covs closely related to mammal covs should warn for the potential emergence of new threatening viruses
background severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov is a newly emerging virus that causes sars with high mortality rate in infected people successful control of the global sars epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread as well as the development of vaccines and new antiviral compounds including neutralizing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease the human synthetic single-chain fragment variable scfv eth-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scfvs against the nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov using a bio panning-based strategy the selected scfvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for sars-cov n protein detection in elisa western blotting and immunocytochemistry results human scfv antibodies to n protein of sars-cov can be easily isolated by selecting the eth-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen these in vitro selected human scfvs specifically recognize in elisa and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in n protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations sars-cov particles in infected vero cells the human scfv antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful reagents for rapid detection of n sars-cov protein and sars virus particles in infected target cells

continued improvements in vaccination technologies have led to remarkable progress in the control of human infectious diseases our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of dna immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens rather than the actual antigens themselves can be effective in eliciting an immune response given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes the opportunities that dna vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history since its inception dna vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed improved modes of administration the use of codon and antigen gene optimization and the implementation of vaccination dna prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of dna vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials significant progress has been made in developing dna vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets such as hiv-1 influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome associated
bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in cattle and causes yearly outbreaks with high morbidity in europe commercial vaccines against this virus needs improvement of efficacy especially in calves with brsv-specific maternally derived antibodies mda we previously reported that an experimental brsv-iscom vaccine but not a commercial vaccine induced strong clinical and virological protection in calves with mda immunized at 7-15 weeks of age the aim of the present study was to characterize the immune responses as well as to investigate the efficacy and safety in younger animals representing the target population for vaccination four groups of five 3-8 week old calves with variable levels of brsv-specific mda were immunized s c twice at a 3 weeks interval with i brsv immunostimulating complexes brsv-iscoms ii brsv-protein iii adjuvant or iv pbs all calves were challenged with virulent brsv by aerosol 2 weeks later and euthanized on day 6 after infection the cellular and humoral responses were monitored as well as the clinical signs the viral excretion and the pathology following challenge despite presence of mda at the time of the immunization only a minimum of clinical signs were observed in the brsv-iscom group after challenge in contrast in all control groups clinical signs of disease were observed in most of the animals respiratory rates up to 76 min −1 and rectal temperatures up to 41 • c the clinical protection was associated to a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of calves rapid systemic and local antibody responses and t helper cell responses dominated by ifn␥ production animals that did not shed virus detectable by pcr or cell culture following challenge possessed particularly high levels of pulmonary iga the protective immunological responses to brsv proteins and the ability to overcome the inhibiting effect of mda were dependent on iscom borne antigen presentation
the duration and nature of immunity generated in response to sars-cov-2 infection is unknown many public health responses and modeled scenarios for covid-19 outbreaks caused by sars-cov-2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time the timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen the presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination when available will affect future transmission and illness severity the dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity here we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 as well as the related sars-cov-1 mers-cov and human endemic coronaviruses hcovs we reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus 1 antibody kinetics 2 correlates of protection 3 immunopathogenesis 4 antigenic diversity and cross-reactivity and 5 population seroprevalence while studies of sars-cov-2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research
rabies virus remains an important burden of disease claiming an estimated 60000 lives each year mainly children and having a huge economical and societal cost post-exposure prophylaxis pep is highly effective however in patients that present with neurological symptoms the case-fatality ratio is extremely high >99%. during the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules in particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other mononegavirales paramyxoviruses filoviruses which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies effective rabies antivirals for therapeutic use need to be molecules that can be dosed into the cerebrospinal fluid and that rapidly and potently block ongoing virus replication and as such stop the further spread of the virus antivirals for prophylactic use can also be envisaged and these should be able to prevent infection of peripheral nerve cells and should have the potential to replace the current anti-rabies immunoglobulins that are used in pep
currently the pathogenic role of ehrlichia canis in cats has been proposed predominantly on the basis of the serologic evidence of natural infection and the infrequent detection of morulae-like structures within the cytoplasm of leukocytes in cats the purpose of this report was to provide molecular evidence supporting e canis-like infection in 3 cats that had clinical manifestations consistent with canine ehrlichiosis but lacked antibodies to e canis antigens serum from all 3 cats contained antinuclear antibodies anas the predominant disease manifestation was polyarthritis in 1 cat and bone marrow hypoplasia or dysplasia accompanied by pancytopenia or anemia and thrombocytopenia in 1 cat each the alignment of e canis partial 16s ribosomal dna rdna 382 nucleotide positions amplified from edta blood samples from each cat was identical to each other and was identical to a canine isolate of e canis genbank accession number af373613 in 1 cat concurrent treatment with corticosteroids may have interfered with the therapeutic effectiveness of doxycycline for the elimination of e canis-like infection to further define the spectrum of ehrlichiosis in cats polymerase chain reaction pcr testing may be necessary until serologic testing is thoroughly validated in experimentally or naturally infected cats in addition until e canis has been isolated from cats and several tissue culture isolates are available from disparate geographic regions for detailed comparative genetic study the molecular evidence presented in this study supporting e canis-like infection in cats must be interpreted with caution

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs remains one of the most economically significant diseases in the swine industry worldwide the current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence and the need for better vaccines are urgent the immunological hallmarks in prrsv-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type i interferons ifns-a/b and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses indicating that prrsv has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host type i ifns are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity thus ifn antagonism-negative prrsv is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad-spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs such vaccines are promising alternatives to traditional vaccines for prrsv
background la crosse virus lacv family bunyaviridae was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in la crosse wisconsin lacv is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in north america and infects up to 300000 persons each year of which 70-130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system cns as an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development we examined lacv infectivity pathogenesis and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice lacv replicated in various organs before reaching the cns where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease the peripheral site where lacv replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates and presumably lacv can enter the cns via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium the mouse infectious dose 50 and lethal dose 50 was similar for lacv administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally lacv was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 pfu however the infection was asymptomatic and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response in mice lacv likely gains access to the cns via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons the ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that lacv might use this route to infect its natural hosts rhesus monkeys are susceptible to lacv infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 pfu mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for lacv vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal
among approximately 1000 adenoviruses from chimpanzees and bonobos studied recently the pan adenovirus type 3 panad3 isolated from a bonobo pan paniscus has one of the best profiles for a vaccine vector combining potent transgene immunogenicity with minimal pre-existing immunity in the human population in this study we inserted into a replication defective panad3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein np and matrix 1 m1 we then studied antibody and t cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model a single intranasal administration of panad3-npm1 vaccine induced strong antibody and t cell responses and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge thus panad3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines including universal influenza vaccines
newcastle disease virus ndv is a pathogenic strain of avian paramyxovirus apmv-1 that is among the most serious of disease threats to the poultry industry worldwide viral diversity is high in apmv-1 eight genotypes are recognized based on phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences modified live vaccines have been developed to decrease the economic losses caused by this virus vaccines derived from avirulent genotype ii strains were developed in the 1950s and are in use globally whereas australian strains belonging to genotype i were developed as vaccines in the 1970s and are used mainly in asia in this study we evaluated the consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination on the evolution of apmv-1 genotypes there was phylogenetic incongruence among trees based on individual genes and complete coding region of 54 full length apmv-1 genomes suggesting that recombinant sequences were present in the data set subsequently five recombinant genomes were identified four of which contained sequences from either genotype i or ii the population history of vaccine-related genotype ii strains was distinct from other apmv-1 genotypes genotype ii emerged in the late 19 th century and is evolving more slowly than other genotypes which emerged in the 1960s despite vaccination efforts genotype ii viruses have experienced constant population growth to the present in contrast other contemporary genotypes showed population declines in the late 1990s additionally genotype i and ii viruses which are circulating in the presence of homotypic vaccine pressure have unique selection profiles compared to nonvaccine-related strains collectively these data show that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of apmv-1 by maintaining a large effective population size of a vaccine-related genotype allowing for coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains and by applying unique selective pressures on viral glycoproteins

in current sampling approaches there exists a divergence between the surveillance of arthropod-borne and that of non-arthropod-borne viruses it is commonly held that the collection of vector specimens applies only to arbovirus surveillance and that the surveillance of non-arboviruses must rely on traditional methods that involve the sampling of blood faeces or saliva or other examinations the vector-based approach is a sampling method that has the ability to survey both arboviruses and non-arboviruses by distinguishing engorged vector specimens from entire vector samples accordingly five arboviruses and three non-arboviruses were detected in a study using a vector-based approach conducted during 2012-2015 hence this report provides the first description of the taiwanese vector species for the bovine arboviruses detected the present investigations demonstrate that the vector-based approach applies not only to the surveillance of arboviruses but also has potential as a possible tool for monitoring non-arboviruses on livestock farms in the future
hantaviruses hvs are rodent-transmitted viruses that can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps in the americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in eurasia together these viruses have annually caused approximately 200000 human infections worldwide in recent years with a case fatality rate of 5-15% for hfrs and up to 40% for hcps there is currently no effective treatment available for either hfrs or hcps only whole virus inactivated vaccines against htnv or seov are licensed for use in the republic of korea and china but the protective efficacies of these vaccines are uncertain to a large extent the immune correlates of protection against hantavirus are not known in this review we summarized the epidemiology virology and pathogenesis of four hfrs-causing viruses htnv seov puuv and dobv and two hcps-causing viruses andv and snv and then discussed the existing knowledge on vaccines and therapeutics against these diseases we think that this information will shed light on the rational development of new vaccines and treatments

francisella tularensis is classified as a tier 1 select agent by the cdc due to its low infectious dose and the possibility that the organism can be used as a bioweapon the low dose of infection suggests that francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses although~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection the early interactions of virulent francisella with the lung environment are not well understood to provide additional insights into plos one |
the search for new immunobiologicals against canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl has intensified in the last decade however it still remains to be elucidated that mechanisms of the innate immune response in situ after immunization a i the aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of cell migration in the skin dogs with distinct antigenic compounds of the lbsap vaccine our major findings indicated that saponin adjuvant alone or combined with leishmania braziliensis antigen induced strong local acute inflammatory reaction however these reactions not progressed to ulcerated lesions overall the cell profile found in sap and lbsap was composed of neutrophils lymphocytes and eosinophils there was also increased production of inos in sap and lbsap groups thus we can conclude that dogs immunized by lbsap and the saponin adjuvant elicited a potential innate-immune activations status compatible with effective control of the resistance to infection by leishmania and contributing to a better understanding of the innate-immunity events induced by the lbsap vaccine
background pre-weaning diarrhea pwd is a syndrome affecting farm-raised neonatal mink kits apart from diarrhea it causes greasy skin exudation dehydration and distressed behavior and can ultimately lead to death no specific causative agents have been identified and the syndrome is regarded as multifactorial the aim of the present study was to investigate a possible inflammatory state in mink kits with pwd as indicated by raised serum concentrations of the acute phase protein serum amyloid a saa and by changes in intestinal pathomorphology and intestinal contents of bacteria samples collected from 20 diarrheic mink kits with pwd and 20 age-matched non-diarrheic control mink kits from two commercial danish farms during the pre-weaning period april-may in 2016 were analyzed concentrations of saa in serum samples from mink kits with pwd were significantly higher up to 1000fold compared to non-diarrheic control mink kits significant features of enterocytic vacuolization atrophy and fusion of villi in jejunum and mucosal atrophy of the colon of kits with pwd were found moreover attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes was more often found in kits suffering from pwd while intra-cytoplasmic eosinophil bodies were more frequently observed in control kits cellular infiltrations with mononuclear and neutrophil leukocytes were not associated with disease status bacteria from the staphylococcus intermedius group such as staphylococcus delphini were more frequently cultivated from control mink kits whereas enterococcus spp dominated in mink kits with pwd escherichia coli was cultivated from both control and mink kits with pwd but with a higher frequency from mink kits with pwd conclusion a significant increase in circulating concentrations of saa was found in pwd affected mink kits from 6 to 23 days old compared to controls the histopathological changes in pwd mink kits suggest that the type of diarrhea is secretory attachment of coccoid bacteria therefore might be responsible for an enterotoxic effect causing a loss of balance in movements of ions and water leading to the vacuolization and swelling of the enterocytes the slight to moderate infiltrations of neutrophils irrespectively of diarrheic status and the attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes are comparable to observations found in piglets suffering from new neonatal porcine diarrhea © the authors 2018 this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http//creat iveco mmons .org/licen ses/by/4.0/ which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made the creative commons public domain dedication waiver

influenza vaccines are usually non-adjuvanted but addition of adjuvant may improve immunogenicity and permit dose-sparing critical for vaccine supply in the event of an influenza pandemic the aim of this first-in-man study was to determine the effect of delta inulin adjuvant on the safety and immunogenicity of a reduced dose seasonal influenza vaccine healthy male and female adults aged 18-65 years were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled study to compare the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a reduced-dose 2007 southern hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with advax tm delta inulin adjuvant ltiv + adj when compared to a full-dose of the standard tiv vaccine which does not contain an adjuvant ltiv + adj provided equivalent immunogenicity to standard tiv vaccine as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition hi assays against each vaccine strain as well as against a number of heterosubtypic strains hi responses were sustained at 3 months post-immunisation in both groups antibody landscapes against a large panel of h3n2 influenza viruses showed distinct age effects whereby subjects over 40 years old had a bimodal baseline hi distribution pattern with the highest hi titers against the very oldest h3n2 isolates and with a second hi peak against influenza isolates from the last 5-10 years by contrast subjects >40 years had a unimodal baseline hi distribution with peak recognition of h3n2 isolates from approximately 20 years ago the reduced dose tiv vaccine containing advax adjuvant was well tolerated and no safety issues were identified hence delta inulin may be a useful adjuvant for use in seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccines australia new zealand clinical trial registry actrn12607000599471
it was previously reported that up-regulation of ␣-enolase protein was detected in 65% of patients with non-small cell lung cancers nsclc moreover a high titer of anti-␣enolase antibodies was developed in a smaller proportion 7.4% of these patients than in non-tumor-associated patients and healthy subjects in the present study we characterized polyclonal and single-chain variable fragment scfv anti-␣-enolase antibodies from immunized chickens the e coli-derived recombinant ␣-enolase protein was purified to its high homogenicity as verified by sds-page after the 4th immunization a high titer of specific polyclonal anti-␣-enolase antibodies was elicited in immunized chickens and specifically recognized the purified human ␣-enolase antigen as determined by western blot and elisa the expressed heavy and light chain variable genes vh and vl were isolated from spleen b cells and amplified to construct phage antibody libraries containing scfv molecules after four rounds of panning selection the scfv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were expressed and their binding specificity to ␣-enolase protein was verified using competitive elisa flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining nucleotide sequence analysis from 10 ␣-enolase binding clones showed that 3 30% clones used identical heavy and light genes for scfv antibody expression as represented by enl5 notably amino acid changes in complementarity-determining regions cdrs were more frequently observed than those in framework regions frs in all clones indicating a strong affinity selection through mutations all together it is believed that these polyclonal and scfv igy antibodies may be helpful in the development of molecular diagnostic and therapeutic agents for lung cancers in the future
calf preweaning morbidity and mortality risks have been reported as high in several countries with average values approximating 35 and 7% respectively however limited data are available for calf morbidity and mortality risks on australian dairy farms the aims of this study were 1 to investigate current calf management practices on dairy farms in australia and their association with herd-level morbidity and mortality using a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study and 2 to estimate the prevalence of common enteropathogens causing diarrhea the failure of passive transfer of immunity and poor colostrum quality in a sample of australian dairy farms we analyzed 106 completed questionnaires and samples from 23 farms 202 fecal 253 calf serum and 221 colostrum samples morbidity and mortality risks reported by farmers in preweaned heifers were 23.8 and 5.6% respectively these risks were above the australian dairy industry targets in 75.5 and 66.7% of respondents the zoonotic pathogens cryptosporidium spp and salmonella spp were the most prevalent enteropathogens with a true prevalence of 40.9 and 25.2% respectively salmonella o-group d was present in 67.9% of salmonella-positive samples followed by o-groups b 17.9% and c 10.7%. failure of transfer of passive immunity igg <10 g/l was observed in 41.9% of calves mean herd-level prevalence of 36.2% and only 19.5% of colostrum samples met the standards for immunoglobulin content and microbiological quality collectively these data indicate that there is still considerable room for improvement in calf-rearing practices on australian dairy farms particularly with regard to colostrum management and feeding hygiene
therapeutic human polyclonal antibodies hpabs derived from pooled plasma from human donors are food and drug administration approved biologics used in the treatment of a variety of human diseases powered by the natural diversity of immune response hpabs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses we previously showed that transchromosomic tc cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome hac comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain high and kappachain higk germline loci named as κhac are capable of producing functional hpabs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains bighm and bighml1 are homozygously inactivated double knockouts or dko however b lymphocyte development in these tc cattle is compromised and the overall production of hpabs is low here we report the construction of an improved hac designated as cksl-hacδ by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the hac furthermore for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein higm and bovine transmembrane α and β immunoglobulins bigα and bigβ in the pre-b cell receptor pre-bcr complex we partially replaced bovinized the higm constant domain with the counterpart of bovine igm bigm that is involved in the interaction between bigm and bigα/igβ human igm bovinization would also improve the functionality of higm in supporting b cell activation and proliferation we also report the successful production of dko tc cattle carrying the cksl-hacδ cksl-hacδ/ dko the dramatic improvement of b cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpabs as measured for the human igg isotype in the plasma we further demonstrate that upon immunization by tumor immunogens high titer tumor immunogen-specific human igg higg can be produced from such tc cattle

human cytomegalovirus hcmv a herpesvirus is a ubiquitously distributed pathogen that causes severe disease in immunosuppressed patients and infected newborns efforts are underway to prepare effective subunit vaccines and therapies including antiviral antibodies however current vaccine efforts are hampered by the lack of information on protective immune responses against hcmv characterizing the b-cell response in healthy infected individuals could aid in the design of optimal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to address this problem we determined for the first time the bcell repertoire against glycoprotein b gb of hcmv in different healthy hcmv seropositive individuals in an unbiased fashion hcmv gb represents a dominant viral antigenic determinant for induction of neutralizing antibodies during infection and is also a component in several experimental hcmv vaccines currently being tested in humans our findings have revealed that the vast majority .90% of gb-specific antibodies secreted from b-cell clones do not have virus neutralizing activity most neutralizing antibodies were found to bind to epitopes not located within the previously characterized antigenic domains ad of gb to map the target structures of these neutralizing antibodies we generated a 3d model of hcmv gb and used it to identify surface exposed protein domains two protein domains were found to be targeted by the majority of neutralizing antibodies domain i located between amino acids aa 133-343 of gb and domain ii a discontinuous domain built from residues 121-132 and 344-438 analysis of a larger panel of human sera from hcmv seropositive individuals revealed positivity rates of .50% against domain i and .90% against domain ii respectively in accordance with previous nomenclature the domains were designated ad-4 dom ii and ad-5 dom i respectively collectively these data will contribute to optimal vaccine design and development of antibodies effective in passive immunization
transmissible vaccines have the potential to revolutionize infectious disease control by reducing the vaccination effort required to protect a population against a disease recent efforts to develop transmissible vaccines focus on recombinant transmissible vaccine designs rtvs because they pose reduced risk if intra-host evolution causes the vaccine to revert to its vector form however the shared antigenicity of the vaccine and vector may confer vaccine-immunity to hosts infected with the vector thwarting the ability of the vaccine to spread through the population we build a mathematical model to test whether a rtv can facilitate disease management in instances where reversion is likely to introduce the vector into the population or when the vector organism is already established in the host population and the vector and vaccine share perfect crossimmunity our results show that a rtv can autonomously eradicate a pathogen or protect a population from pathogen invasion when cross-immunity between vaccine and vector is absent if cross-immunity between vaccine and vector exists however our results show that a rtv can substantially reduce the vaccination effort necessary to control or eradicate a pathogen only when continuously augmented with direct manual vaccination these results demonstrate that estimating the extent of cross-immunity between vector and vaccine is a critical step in rtv design and that herpesvirus vectors showing facile reinfection and weak cross-immunity are promising this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license http//creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/.
we evaluated the presence of coronaviruses by pcr in 918 australian wild bird samples collected during 2016-17 coronaviruses were detected in 141 samples 15.3% from species of ducks shorebirds and herons and from multiple sampling locations sequencing of selected positive samples found mainly gammacoronaviruses but also some deltacoronaviruses the detection rate of coronaviruses was improved by using multiple pcr assays as no single assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples sequencing of the relatively conserved orf1 pcr amplicons found that australian duck gammacoronaviruses were similar to duck gammacoronaviruses around the world some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to charadriiformes lineages but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available deltacoronavirus sequences from shorebirds formed a lineage with a deltacoronavirus from a ruddy turnstone detected in the united states given that australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions and australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory palearctic duck species we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of australia coronaviruses cov are the causative agents of significant diseases resulting in substantial impact on human and animal health both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have caused a significant burden on human health including a number of deaths and have had significant socioeconomic impacts on the countries in which people were infected 1-3 . coronavirus infections of livestock such as porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv and more recently porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov in pigs and infectious bronchitis virus ibv and turkey coronavirus in poultry have significant impacts on animal health and cause considerable economic costs to producers 4-7 .interspecies spill-over of coronaviruses into new hosts occurs frequently with sars-cov and mers-cov being the most notable examples of spill-over into humans
adjuvants can enhance vaccine immunogenicity and induce long-term enhancement of immune responses thus adjuvants are important for vaccine research polysaccharides isolated from select chinese herbs have been demonstrated to possess various beneficial functions and excellent adjuvant abilities in the present study the polysaccharides iip-a-1 and iip-2 were isolated from isatis indigotica root and compared with the common vaccine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide via intramuscular co-administration of inactivated rabies virus rcvs-11-g into mice blood was collected to determine virus neutralizing antibody vna titers and b and t lymphocyte activation status inguinal lymph node samples were collected and used to measure b lymphocyte proliferation splenocytes were isolated from which antigen-specific cellular immune responses were detected via elispot elisa and intracellular cytokine staining the results revealed that both types of polysaccharides induce more rapid changes and higher vna titers than aluminum hydroxide flow cytometry assays revealed that the polysaccharides activated more b lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and more b and t lymphocytes in the blood than aluminum hydroxide antigen-specific cellular immune responses showed that iip-2 strongly induced t lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and high levels of cytokine secretion from splenocytes whereas aluminum hydroxide induced proliferation in only a small number of lymphocytes and the secretion of only small quantities of cytokines collectively these data suggest that the polysaccharide iip-2 exhibits excellent adjuvant activity and can enhance both cellular and humoral immunity
as a new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 vaccine approach the live-attenuated measles virus mv schwarz vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express the f4 antigen mv1-f4 f4 is a fusion protein comprising hiv-1 antigens p17 and p24 reverse transcriptase and nef this study assessed the toxicity biodistribution and shedding profiles of mv1-f4 cynomolgus macaques were intramuscularly immunized one or three times with the highest dose of mv1-f4 intended for clinical use the reference schwarz measles vaccine or saline and monitored clinically for 11 or 85 days toxicological parameters included local and systemic clinical signs organ weights haematology clinical and gross pathology and histopathology both vaccines were well tolerated with no morbidity clinical signs or gross pathological findings observed mean spleen weights were increased after three doses of either vaccine which corresponded with increased numbers and/or sizes of germinal centers this was likely a result of the immune response to the vaccines either vaccine virus replicated preferentially in secondary lymphoid organs and to a lesser extent in epithelium-rich tissues e g intestine urinary bladder and trachea and the liver at the expected peak of viremia viral rna was detected in some biological fluid samples from few animals immunized with either vaccine but none of these samples contained infectious virus in conclusion no shedding of infectious viral particles was identified in cynomolgus monkeys after injection of mv1-f4 or schwarz measles vaccines furthermore no toxic effect in relation to the mv vaccination was found with these vaccines in this study
a modtfied live virus vaccine against feline infectious peritonitis fip was evaluated in a double blind placebo-controlled field trial in two high-risk populations the vaccine was found to be safe and eficacious in one population of cats that had low antibody titre against feline coronavirus fco v at the time of vaccination although clinically healthy at the time of vaccination retrospectively some vaccinees that later came down with fip were found to be rt-pcr positive for fcov in plasma and showed changes in blood parameters consistent with early stage of fip it is concluded that vaccination can protect cats with no or low fcov antibody titres and that in some cats vaccine failure was probably due to pre-existing infection 0 1997 elsevier science ltd

antigen-specific immunotherapy using dna vaccines has emerged as an attractive approach for the control of tumors another novel cancer therapy involves the employment of the vascular disrupting agent 56dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid dmxaa in the current study we aimed to test the combination of dmxaa treatment with human papillomavirus type 16 hpv-16 e7 dna vaccination to enhance the antitumor effects and e7-specific cd8+ t cell immune responses in treated mice we determined that treatment with dmxaa generates significant therapeutic effects against tc-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice we then found that combination of dmxaa treatment with e7 dna vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and e7-specific cd8+ t cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor bearing mice furthermore the dmxaa-mediated enhancement or suppression of e7-specific cd8+ t cell immune responses generated by crt/e7 dna vaccination was found to be dependent on the time of administration of dmxaa and was also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines in addition we determined that inducible nitric oxide synthase inos plays a role in the immune suppression caused by dmxaa administration before dna vaccination our study has significant implications for future clinical translation
to identify unknown human viruses in the enteric tract we examined 105 stool specimens from patients with diarrhea in bangladesh a novel calicivirus was identifi ed in a sample from 1 patient and subsequently found in samples from 5 other patients phylogenetic analyses classifi ed this virus within the proposed genus recovirus
hantaviruses are the causative agents of hfrs and hcps hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome two severe and often fatal human diseases mortality from hfrs varies between hantaviruses hantaan and dobrava show the highest seoul intermediate and puumala low mortality saaremaa genetically closely related to dobrava is also known to induce hfrs with low or no mortality in this study mice were inoculated with dobrava and saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility lethality viremia nitric oxide production and antibody responses out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of dobrava virus respectively 1/8 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18e26 days in all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production all suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50 500 or 5000 focus-forming units of saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted clearly lower viral titers were observed for the saaremaa virus-inoculated mice also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection compared to those in mice that died following dobrava virus infection dobrava saaremaa puumala and hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic and the anti-nucleocapsid protein igg2a/igg1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with dobrava virus than in those inoculated with saaremaa virus elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice and inosÿ/ÿ mice like normal mice cleared viremia in conclusion we show that dobrava virus and saaremaa virus induce distinct differences in terms of survival viremia nitric oxide production and antibody responses in mice
background diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are rna viruses next generation sequencing ngs deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level the diversity of rna viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by ngs samples were selected among the cases submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratories of infectious diseases of the universitat autònoma de barcelona barcelona spain and universidad de león león spain results the analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of rna viruses most samples were co-infected by several viruses kobuvirus and rotavirus were more commonly reported with sapovirus astrovirus 3 4 and 5 enterovirus g porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pasivirus and posavirus being less frequently detected most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in genbank allowing us to propose several new vp4 and vp7 genotypes for rotavirus b and rotavirus c conclusions among the cases analysed rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs besides in a small number of cases kobuvirus and sapovirus may also have an aetiological role even most animals were co-infected in early life the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear the ngs method applied successfully characterized the rna virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity
disease or pathogen risk prioritisations aid understanding of infectious agent impact within surveillance or mitigation and biosecurity work but take significant development previous work has shown the h-hirsch-index as an alternative proxy we present a weighted risk analysis describing infectious pathogen impact for human health human pathogens and wellbeing domestic animal pathogens using an objective evidence-based repeatable approach the h-index this study established the highest h-index european pathogens commonalities amongst pathogens not included in previous surveillance or risk analyses were examined differences between host types humans/animals/zoonotic in pathogen hindices were explored as a one health impact indicator finally the acceptability of the h-index proxy for animal pathogen impact was examined by comparison with other measures 57 pathogens appeared solely in the top 100 highest h-indices 1 human or 2 animal pathogens list and 43 occurred in both of human pathogens 66 were zoonotic and 67 were emerging compared to 67 and 57 for animals there were statistically significant differences between h-indices for host types humans animal zoonotic and there was limited evidence that h-indices are a reasonable proxy for animal pathogen impact this work addresses measures outlined by the european commission to strengthen climate change resilience and biosecurity for infectious diseases the results include a quantitative evaluation of infectious pathogen impact and suggest greater impacts of human-only compared to zoonotic pathogens or scientific under-representation of zoonoses the outputs separate high and low impact pathogens and should be combined with other risk assessment methods relying on expert opinion or qualitative data for priority setting or could be used to prioritise diseases for which formal risk assessments are not possible because of data gaps
the number of emerging infectious diseases is increasing characterizing novel or re-emerging infections is aided by the availability of pathogen genomes in this review we evaluate methods that exploit pathogen sequences and the contribution of genomic analysis to understand the epidemiology of recently emerged infectious diseases
twenty-five serum samples of 22 free-living european wildcats felis silvestris captured from 1991 to 1993 in central spain were tested for evidence of exposure to seven feline pathogens all the wildcats but one 95.4% presented evidence of contact with at least one of the agents mean=2.2 contact with feline leukemia virus felv was detected in 81% of the wildcats antibodies 77% antigen p27 15%. antibodies to feline calicivirus fcv 80% feline herpesvirus fhv 20% feline parvovirus fpv 18% and chlamydophila sp 27% were also detected analyses were negative for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline coronavirus the probability of having antibodies to fpv was inversely related with the concentration of serum cholesterol and with a morphometric index of body condition similarity in the composition of antibodies against disease agents number and identity of detected and undetected antibodies was significantly higher in pairs of female wildcats than in pairs of males or heterosexual pairs suggesting that females had a more homogeneous exposure to pathogens seroprevalence for fhv was higher in males than in females antibodies to fhv and chlamydophila sp were more frequent in winter than in other seasons in addition the mean similarity of the pathogen community between pairs of serum samples was higher if both wildcats were caught during the same season than if they were not mean similarity was lowest when serum samples obtained in winter were compared with those from spring or summer the results suggest that some agents probably had a reservoir in domestic cats and may cause some undetected morbidity/mortality in the studied wildcat population whereas others such as felv and fcv may be enzootic
this review examines the dynamics of tick biology and tick-borne infections in the united states clinical tick-borne diseases in dogs and cats are discussed we demonstrate that there is much interest in tickborne infections at the level of the lay public pet owners describe trends in the distribution and prevalence of tickborne infections in the u s summarize some issues in understanding the degree of ill health due to tickborne infections and suggest some avenues for research that would clarify these issues
this study analyzed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against hiv-1 using three different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses nsv expressing hiv-1 gag as vaccine vectors rabies virus rabv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv and newcastle disease virus ndv we hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen to this end we primed balb/c mice with each of the nsv-based vectors primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous nsv-gag viruses the magnitude and quality of the gag-specific cd8 + t cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured in addition we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing hiv-1 gag vv-gag thirty-three days after the boost inoculation our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected gag-specific cd8 + t cell recall responses post boost and that ndv-gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of cd8 + t cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used however the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using vv-gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations taken together our data show that nsv vectors can individually stimulate hiv-gag specific cd8 + t cells that are effectively recalled by other nsv vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach these results provide evidence that rabv vsv and ndv can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses
development of antivirals has focused primarily on vaccines and on treatments for specific viral agents although effective these approaches may be limited in situations where the etiologic agent is unknown or when the target virus has undergone mutation recombination or reassortment augmentation of the innate immune response may be an effective alternative for disease amelioration nonspecific broad-spectrum immune responses can be induced by double-stranded dsrnas such as poly iclc or oligonucleotides odns containing unmethylated deocycytidyl-deoxyguanosinyl cpg motifs these may offer protection against various bacterial and viral pathogens regardless of their genetic makeup zoonotic origin or drug resistance
1background the sars-cov-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with sars-cov both 2 exhibiting a similar well conserved structure therefore antibodies produced in covid-19 and 3 sars patients should not be that dissimilar we evaluated sars-cov test assays to detect for 4 the presence of antibodies to sars-cov-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of 5 these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients methods tests were carried out using 6 elisa total antibodies and indirect immunofluorescence iifa igm & igg methods on 7 serial sera from patients confirmed with sars-cov-2 infection results cross-reactivity was 8 seen in these two test assays with sera from covid-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 9 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms five of the patients had detectable antibodies by 10 the 3 rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients the iifa 11 method was marginally more sensitive compared to the elisa assay however the iifa igm test 12 was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity conclusions existing 13 diagnostic assays for sars-cov can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with 14 covid-19 these assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological 15 investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new 16 emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for sars-cov-2
the domestic cat is afflicted with multiple viruses that serve as powerful models for human disease including cancers sars and hiv/aids cat viruses that cause these diseases have been studied for decades revealing detailed insight concerning transmission virulence origins and pathogenesis here we review recent genetic advances that have questioned traditional wisdom regarding the origins of virulent feline infectious peritonitis fip diseases the pathogenic potential of feline immunodeficiency virus fiv in wild non-domestic felidae species and the restriction of feline leukemia virus felv mediated immune impairment to domestic cats rather than other felidae species the most recent interpretations indicate important new evolutionary conclusions implicating these deadly infectious agents in domestic and non-domestic felids
infectious bronchitis ib is an acute highly contagious disease which causes economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide to control the disease biosecurity and vaccination are required in the current research we rapidly attenuated a qx-like ibv field strain zyy-2014 using passage in embryos at limiting dilution and tested the safety and efficacy of the attenuated chinese qx-like ibv strain zyyr-2014 in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free spf chickens through spray route our result revealed that the attenuated strain presented a decreased pathogenicity in 1-day-old chickens the strain zyy-2014 inoculated birds presented typical ibv clinical signs with a mortality of 43% while the attenuated strain zyyr-2014 inoculated birds remained healthy the strain zyyr-2014 also presented stronger antibody responses and lower viral loads in tracheas lungs and kidneys when vaccinated through spray route into 1-day-old spf chickens our data suggest a potential of the attenuated zyyr-2014 strain as a vaccine candidate applied in hatchery which can contribute in preventing the qx-like ibv infections furthermore attenuation by passage at limiting dilution could be applied for rapid vaccine development against emerging strains
we have previously identified neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev by panning a large nonimmune antibody library against a soluble form of the hev attachment-envelope glycoprotein g sg hev . one of these antibodies m102 which exhibited the highest level of cross-reactive neutralization of both niv and hev g was affinity maturated by light-chain shuffling combined with random mutagenesis of its heavychain variable domain and panning against sg hev . one of the selected antibody fab clones m102.4 had affinity of binding to sg hev that was equal to or higher than that of the other fabs it was converted to igg1 and tested against infectious niv and hev it exhibited exceptionally potent and cross-reactive inhibitory activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations below 0.04 and 0.6 g/ml respectively the virus-neutralizing activity correlated with the binding affinity of the antibody to sg hev and sg niv . m102.4 bound a soluble form of niv g sg niv better than it bound sg hev and it neutralized niv better than hev despite being originally selected against sg hev . these results suggest that m102.4 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diseases caused by henipaviruses it could be also used for prophylaxis and diagnosis and as a research reagent hendra virus hev and nipah virus niv are highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses that have recently emerged from flying fox populations to cause serious disease outbreaks in humans and livestock in australia malaysia singapore bangladesh and india . hev emerged in queensland australia in 1994 killing 1 human and 14 horses and the virus was responsible for at least 4 other sporadic outbreaks involving horses and humans between 1994 and 2006 . the closely related niv emerged in 1998 -1999 in peninsular malaysia resulting in the death of more than 100 people and the culling of more than one million pigs . since then several outbreaks of niv infection have been recorded in bangladesh and india . several important observations have been made during these most recent outbreaks such as a higher incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome higher rates of person-to-person transmission and higher case fatality rates 60%-75% compared with the malaysian outbreak with case fatality rates of ϳ40% in which the virus was initially discovered .
background equine coronavirus ecov is associated with clinical disease in adult horses outbreaks are associated with a low case fatality rate and a small number of animals with signs of encephalopathic disease are described objectives the aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of two outbreaks of ecov infection that were associated with an high case fatality rate animals 14 miniature horses and 1 miniature donkey testing fecal positive for ecov from two related disease outbreaks methods retrospective study describing the epidemiological findings clinicopathological findings and fecal viral load from affected horses results in ecov positive horses 27% 4/15 of the animals died or were euthanized severe hyperammonemia 677 lmol/l reference range ≤60 lmol/l was identified in one animal with signs of encephalopathic disease that subsequently died fecal viral load ecov genome equivalents per gram of feces was significantly higher in the nonsurvivors compared to animals that survived p = .02 conclusions and clinical importance equine coronavirus had a higher case fatality rate in this group of miniature horses than previously reported in other outbreaks of varying breeds hyperammonemia could contribute to signs of encephalopathic disease and the fecal viral load might be of prognostic value in affected horses
polymicrobial diseases involve two or more microorganisms that act synergistically or in succession to mediate complex disease processes although polymicrobial diseases in animals and humans can be caused by similar organisms these disease are often also caused by organisms from different kingdoms genera species strains substrains and even by phenotypic variants of a single species animal models are often required to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis and to develop therapies and prevention regimes however reproducing polymicrobial diseases of humans in animal hosts presents significant challenges
peste des petits ruminants ppr is an acute febrile viral disease of small ruminants that has a significant economic impact for many viral diseases vaccination with virus-like particles vlps has shown considerable promise as a prophylactic approach however the processes of assembly and release of peste des petits ruminants virus pprv vlps are not well characterized and their immunogenicity in the host is unknown in this study vlps of pprv were generated in a baculovirus system through simultaneous expression of pprv matrix m protein and hemaglutin in h or fusion f protein the released vlps showed morphology similar to that of the native virus particles subcutaneous injection of these vlps pprv-h pprv-f into mice and goats elicited pprv-specific igg production increased the levels of virus neutralizing antibodies and promoted lymphocyte proliferation without adjuvants the immune response induced by the pprv-h vlps was comparable to that obtained using equivalent amounts of pprv vaccine thus our results demonstrated that vlps containing pprv m protein and h or f protein are potential ''differentiating infected from vaccinated animals'' diva vaccine candidates for the surveillance and eradication of ppr
humans who experience a primary dengue virus denv infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection affected individuals also generate cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous denv serotypes which are non-neutralizing dengue cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection of fc receptor bearing cells and potentially exacerbate disease the actual binding sites of human antibody on the denv particle are not well defined we characterized the specificity and neutralization potency of polyclonal serum antibodies and memory b-cell derived monoclonal antibodies hmabs from 2 individuals exposed to primary denv infections most denv-specific hmabs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing moreover many hmabs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble recombinant antigen re protein nonetheless by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to re we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of denv our mabs results indicate that in these two individuals exposed to primary denv infections a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization
skinks of the genus sphenomorphus are the most diverse clade of squamates in the philippine archipelago morphological examination of these species has defined six phenotypic groups that are commonly used in characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses we used a molecular phylogeny based on four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes to assess the group's biogeographical history in the archipelago and examine the phylogenetic validity of the currently recognized philippine species groups we re-examined traditional characters used to define species groups and used multivariate statistics to quantitatively evaluate group structure in morphometric space clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity indicate that some but not all members of previously defined species groups are phenotypically most similar to other members of the same group however when species group membership was mapped on our partitioned bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis only one species group corresponds to a clade all other species group arrangements are strongly rejected by our phylogeny our results demonstrate that 1 previously recognized species group relationships were misled by phenotypic convergence 2 sphenomorphus is widely paraphyletic and 3 multiple lineages have independently invaded the philippines based on this new perspective on the phylogenetic relationships of philippine sphenomorphus we revise the archipelago's diverse assemblage of species at the generic level and resurrect and/or expand four previously recognized genera and describe two new genera to accommodate the diversity of philippine skinks of the sphenomorphus group
the chapter begins by establishing the defi nition of soft fruit then discusses microbial and chemical hazards that might be found in soft fruit methods developed for virus detection in soft fruit are reviewed and fi nally the factors that mainly affect virus detection are detailed as these pathogens are currently linked to outbreaks caused by soft fruit consumption
and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the northeast pacific ocean risk of s neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events we examined the spatial distribution of s neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from california washington british columbia and alaska significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in california and washington compared with british columbia and alaska adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to s neurona and there were strong associations with terrestrial features wetlands cropland high human housing-unit density in california habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk these findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for toxoplasma gondii with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features ocean physical processes and invertebrate bioconcentration sarcocystis neurona most widely known as the main etiologic agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis is one of two pathogens that causes fatal protozoal encephalitis pe in sea otters enhydra lutris following recognition of this disease in sea otters 1 s neurona and toxoplasma gondii were identified as important causes of mortality of southern sea otters e lutris nereis 1 . although exposure to s neurona may be slightly less common overall 2 s neurona-related disease is generally more severe at least in acute and subacute cases 12 . a mass-stranding event in 2004 was attributed largely to s neurona infection forty sick or dead sea otters stranded on beaches near morro
antibodies against the protective antigen pa of bacillus anthracis play a key role in response to infection by this important pathogen the aim of this study was to produce and characterize monoclonal antibodies mabs specific for pa and to identify novel neutralizing epitopes three murine mabs with high specificity and nanomolar affinity for b anthracis recombinant protective antigen rpa were produced and characterized western immunoblot analysis coupled with epitope mapping using overlapping synthetic peptides revealed that these mabs recognize a linear epitope within domain 2 of rpa neutralization assays demonstrate that these mabs effectively neutralize lethal toxin in vitro
background two french families were investigated in the first a husband wife and 4 children had crohn's disease in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease there was no history of crohn's disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to hla haplotypes methods methods included family interviews review of medical records radiographs and pathology slides serology selective stool culture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection and immunocytochemlstry results in both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7-13-month periods there appeared to be a 4-&year recurrence of new disease in both families radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease confined to distal ileum and cecum in the members of family 1 examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available acid-fast organisms or carnpylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and yersinia stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria yersinia and mycoplasma torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool serology was negative for antibodies to bruce/la yersinia influenza and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals conclusions the circumstances and data suggest that an infectious microorganism is responsible for these clusterings of crohn's disease
we aimed to systematically analyze the immunological properties of monovalent and bivalent dengue virus-like particles denv vlps prepared in our study and provided basis for the development of denv vlps as a promising non-infectious candidate vaccine for dengue infection the denv-1/2 vlps were prepared in the gap promoter-based p pastoris expression system using α-factor secretion signal groups of mice were immunized by monovalent and bivalent vlps compared with inactivated virions and pbs then the humoral immune response in mice were tested by elisa immunofluorescence and neutralization assay elisa and enzyme linked immunospot assay were performed for investigating cytokines production after virus challenge in vivo and in vitro respectively besides the protection ability of vlps was assessed by passive protection assay in suckling mice the recombinant denv-1/2 vlps were successfully expressed with α-factor secretion signal sera of mice immunized with monovalent and bivalent vlps elevated the specific antibodies level comparable to inactivated virions group the monovalent and bivalent vlps induced specific cellular immune response as confirmed by elispot the prnt 50 titers of monovalent and bivalent vlps sera against denv-1/2 were different ranging from 16 to 64 moreover anti-monovalent and anti-bivalent denv vlps sera displayed protective capacity in survival rate and morbidity monovalent and bivalent vlps showed attracting vaccine effect for dengue virus the multivalent vlps may be promising for preventing different types of dengue virus
the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov it spread rapidly to many countries and developing a sars vaccine is now urgently required in order to study the immunogenicity of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov virion as a vaccine candidate we subcutaneously immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov with or without an adjuvant we chose aluminum hydroxide gel alum as an adjuvant because of its long safety history for human use we observed that the uv-inactivated sars-cov virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory b cells with the addition of alum to the vaccine formula serum igg production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice though it was still insufficient to elicit serum iga antibodies notably the sars-cov virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant anti-sars-cov antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus furthermore the uv-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node t-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production il-2 il-4 il-5 ifn-c and tnf-a upon restimulation with inactivated sars-cov virion in vitro thus a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a sars vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity
wildlife are frequently a neglected component of one health however the linkages between the health of wildlife and human domestic animal and environmental health are clear the majority of emerging zoonotic diseases are linked to wildlife primarily driven by anthropogenic land changes despite this risk wildlife have important links to people as environmental indicators food security and safety and through human livelihoods this chapter will describe these linkages and demonstrate the need to understand these linkages through targeted surveillance and understanding the ecology of wildlife diseases while the management of wildlife diseases presents a significant challenge such practices will greatly improve the health of people domestic animals wildlife and the environment
calculation of infectious viral titers represents a basic and essential experimental approach for virologists classical plaque assays cannot be used for viruses that do not cause significant cytopathic effects which is the case for strains 229e and oc43 of human coronavirus hcov an alternative indirect immunoperoxidase assay ipa is herein described for the detection and titration of these viruses susceptible cells are inoculated with serial logarithmic dilutions of samples in a 96-well plate after viral growth viral detection by ipa yields the infectious virus titer expressed as "tissue culture infectious dose" tcid 50 . this represents the dilution of a virus-containing sample at which half of a series of laboratory wells contain replicating virus this technique is a reliable method for the titration of hcov in biological samples cells tissues or fluids
all mammals are colonised by escherichia coli generally at birth and these organisms become part of their intestinal flora for the rest of their lives new types are acquired generally by an oral route some e coli are pathogenic and some may have a far more enhanced ability to colonise the human intestine than most others recently enterohaemorrhagic e coli have emerged they can cause a number of intestinal illnesses in humans including bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome these organisms produce a number of virulence factors particularly the shiga-like toxins verotoxins the intestines of animals may be the reservoir of these organisms for human infection and cattle particularly have been shown to harbour them food especially undercooked meat products have been associated with a number of outbreaks throughout the world while a certain serotype 0157 h7 has been associated with many outbreaks throughout the world other serotypes particularly 011l h- have also been reported this latter serotype appears to be more common in australia a u s~ vet j 73 20 -26
diarrhea and colitis were common clinical entities observed during a recent two-year interval in the marmoset colony located at oak ridge associated universities oak ridge tennessee the diarrhea occurred in sporadic episodes of several weeks duration and affected up to 5% of all animals at any one time the incidence of the colitis is unknown but it appeared to be widespread histologically the colitis was similar to that described in cottontop tamarins saguinus oedipus oedipus at the new england primate center 1 there was infiltration of predominantly mononuclear cells into the interstitium dilation of crypts with flattened epithelium and accumulation of neutrophils and degenerated and necrotic epithelial cells in the lumen 2 the cause of either the diarrhea or the colitis is not known nor is it known to what extent they are causally related in this report we describe studies demonstrating both coronavirus-like particles and campylobacter in marmosets with diarrhea coronavirus-like particles were found in 24% and campylobacter fetus subsp jejuni in 20% of sampled animals with diarrhea immunoblotting studies on serum from a from the
avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis which results in considerable economic losses it is imperative to develop safe and efficient candidate vaccines to control ibv infection in the current study recombinant baculoviruses co-expressing the s1 and n proteins and mono-expressing s1 or n proteins of the gx-yl5 strain of ibv were constructed and prepared into subunit vaccines rhbm-s1-n rhbm-s1 and rhbm-n the levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen-free spf chickens at 14 days of age giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent gx-yl5 strain of ibv 14 days post-booster dpb the commercial vaccine strain h120 was used as a control the ibv-specific antibody levels as well as the percentages of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes were detected within 28 days post-vaccination dpv the morbidity mortality and re-isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post-challenge dpc the results showed that the ibv-specific antibody levels and the percentages of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes were higher in the rhbm-s1-n vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rhbm-s1 and rhbm-n vaccines at 5 dpc the mortality morbidity and virus re-isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rhbm-s1-n vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the h120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rhbm-s1 and rhbm-n vaccines the present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing s1 and n proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono-expressing the s1 or n protein thus the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing s1 and n proteins could serve as a potential ibv vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the s1 and n proteins might be a strategy for the development of an ibv subunit vaccine
infectious bronchitis virus ibv poses a major threat to the chicken industry worldwide in this study we developed a recombinant fowlpox virus rfpv vaccine expressing the ibv s1 gene and chicken interleukin-18 gene il-18 rfpv-s1/il18 recombinant plasmid psy-s1/il18 was constructed by cloning chicken il-18 into fowlpox virus transfer plasmid containing s1 gene and transfected into the chicken embryo fibroblasts cell pre-infected with s-fpv-017 to generate rfpv-s1/il18 expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by rt-pcr and ifa we also constructed the recombinant fowlpox virus rfpv-s1 without il-18 one-day-old chickens were vaccinated by wing-web puncture with the two rfpvs and the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated there was a significant difference in elisa antibody levels p < 0.05 elicited by either rfpv-s1 or rfpv-s1/il18 the ratios of cd4 + to cd8 + in chickens immunized with rfpv-s1/il18 were significantly higher p < 0.05 than in those immunized with rfpv-s1 all chickens immunized with rfpv-s1/il18 were completely protected 20/20 after challenge with the virulent ibv hn99 strain 43 days after immunization while only 15 out of 20 of the chickens immunized with the rfpv-s1 were protected our results show that the protective efficacy of the rfpv-s1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of il-18
reproductive losses in camelids are due to infertility pregnancy loss udder diseases and neonatal mortality caused by a variety of infectious diseases uterine infection and abortion represent the major complaint in camelid veterinary practice the major infectious organisms in endometritis and metritis are e coli and streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus abortion rates due to infectious diseases vary from 10% to more than 70% in some areas leptospirosis toxoplasmosis and chlamydiosis have been diagnosed as the major causes of abortion in llamas and alpacas in camels brucellosis and trypanosomiasis represent the major causes of infectious abortion in the middle east and africa mastitis is rare in south american camelids the prevalence of subclinical udder infection in camels can reach very high proportions in dairy camels udder infections are primarily due to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus neonatal mortality is primarily due to diarrhea following failure of passive transfer and exposure to e coli rotavirus coronavirus coccidia and salmonella this paper reviews the etio-pathogenesis of these causes of reproductive losses as well as the major risk factors and strategies to prevent their occurrence
background the recent ebola virus ebov epidemic highlights the need for efficacious virucidal products to help prevent infection and limit the spread of ebola virus disease however there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against ebov because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide the virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the european standard en144762013/fpra12015 modified vaccinia virus ankara mva was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. for ebov also an enveloped virus the suitability of mva as a surrogate needs to be proven the aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine pvp-i formulations against ebov 4 % pvp-i skin cleanser 7.5 % pvp-i surgical scrub 10 % pvp-i solution and 3.2 % pvp-i and 78 % alcohol solution the formulations were tested with mva to define the test conditions and as a secondary objective the suitability of mva as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like ebov was assessed methods according to en14476 a standard suspension test was used for mva large-volume plating was used for ebov to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects all products were tested under clean 0.3 g/l bsa and dirty 3.0 g/l bsa + 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes conditions with mva for 15 30 and 60 s the concentration-contact time values obtained with mva were verified for ebov results viral titres of mva and ebov were reduced by >99.99 % to >99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of the test products for 15 seconds conclusions all products showed excellent virucidal efficacy against ebov demonstrating the important role pvp-i can play in helping to prevent and limit the spread of ebola virus disease the efficacy against both test viruses after 15 s is helpful information for the implementation of guidance for people potentially exposed to ebov and confirms the excellent virucidal efficacy of pvp-i against enveloped viruses mva was found to be a suitable surrogate for enveloped viruses like ebov

the present study was to characterize turkey coronavirus associated with turkey poult enteritis and mortality intestinal contents or intestines from affected turkey poults and inoculated turkey embryos contained coronaviruses as revealed by electron microscopy or were positive for turkey coronavirus by immunofluorescent antibody assay sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of the virus-containing intestinal homogenate yielded two opalescent bands corresponding to the buoyant densities of 1.14-1.15 and 1.18-1.20 g/ml respectively coronaviral particles from intestinal contents or the sucrose density gradient preparation were mainly spherical in shape and had envelope and central depression they were surrounded by a fringe of regularly spaced petal-shaped projections attached to the particles by a short stalk purified viruses hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 16 major protein bands of purified viruses analyzed by sds-page were located at 200 100-110 50-60 and 30-35 kda the patterns of protein bands were consistent with those of minnesota or quebec turkey coronavirus isolates a 568 bp nucleotide fragment of turkey coronavirus spike protein gene was amplified from rna of inoculated turkey embryo intestine or purified virus sequence analysis of the 568 bp pcr product revealed high degree of identity with the corresponding spike protein gene sequence of human and bovine coronaviruses the results indicated that turkey coronavirus was associated with turkey poults with acute enteritis #
antibodies against the human coronavirus oc43 in human sera were measured by haemagglutination inhibition hi complement fixation cf and radial diffusion-haemolysis in gel hig techniques the apparent hi titres in a fraction of sera with no antibodies detectable by the two other methods were found to be reduced considerably after treating the sera with phospholipase c plc the plc treatment also reduced the apparent hi titres in some sera containing variable amounts of cf and/or hig antibodies but did not affect antibody determinations by the two latter methods these results suggest that false positive results can be obtained in the oc43 hi test unless the sera are treated with phospholipase c before the assay
a 1.5-month-old kangal breed puppy from a dairy cattle farm died after showing severe diarrhoea and incoordination necropsy examination revealed multifocal pulmonary consolidation and necrosis and fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis microscopically there was necrotic and purulent bronchopneumonia myocarditis and non-purulent encephalitis in the jejunum and ileum there was villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia with oocyst-like and schizont-like structures in the epithelia immunohistochemically neospora caninum antigen was detected in association with the intestinal protozoal structures degenerative neurons and areas of necrosis in the lungs and heart polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the organism was n caninum and not toxoplasma gondii the seroprevalence for n caninum was 74.2% 49/66 animals for the cattle and 57.1% 4/7 animals for dogs on this farm this report documents fatal systemic neosporosis and enteroepithelial stages of n caninum in a naturally infected puppy to the authors' knowledge this is the first definition of intestinal neosporosis in a naturally infected dog as well as the first evidence of fatal canine neosporosis in turkey
the duration of challenge resistance in mice immunized with mouse hepatitis virus mhv strain jhm was examined as a model of immunity to corona-virus infection genetically susceptible balb/cbyj mice were immunized by intranasal i n or per os p o inoculation with mhv-jhm or sterile tissue culture fluid sham then challenged i n with mhv-jhm or sterile tissue culture fluid 1 6 or 12 months later four days after challenge virus in nasal turbinates and liver was quantified and prevalance of microscopic lesions in liver and gut-associated lymphoid tissue was tabulated as indices of challenge resistance mhv-immunized and challenged groups were compared to shamimmunized and challenged groups mice immunized by i n inoculation were strongly resistant to challenge at 1 6 and 12 months mice immunized by p o inoculation were resistant at 1 month but became partially susceptible to reinfection at 6 and 12 months based upon all indices these data indicate that depending upon route of immunization mice can become susceptible to reinfection with the same coronavirus strain over time
infectious bronchitis ib is an acute and highly contagious viral respiratory disease of chickens and vaccination is the main method for disease control the s1 protein which contains several virus neutralization epitopes is considered to be a target site of vaccine development however although protective immune responses could be induced by recombinant s1 protein the protection rate in chickens was still low <50%. here we generated fused s1 proteins with ha2 protein rs1-ha2 or transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail rs1-h3tm from hemagglutinin of h3n2 influenza virus after immunization animals vaccinated with fusion proteins rs1-ha2 and rs1-h3tm demonstrated stronger robust humoral and cellular immune responses than that of rs1 and inactivated m41 vaccine the protection rates of groups immunized with rs1-ha2 87% were significantly higher than the groups inoculated with rs1 47% and inactivated m41 vaccine 53%. and chickens injected with rs1-h3tm had similar level of protection 73% comparing to chickens vaccinated with rs1 47% p = 0.07 our data suggest that s1 protein fused to the ha2 or tm proteins from hemagglutinin of h3n2 influenza virus may provide a new strategy for high efficacy recombinant vaccine development against ibv
phylogenetic analysis of complete genomes of the avian coronaviruses avian infectious bronchitis aibv and turkey coronavirus tcov supported the hypothesis that numerous recombination events have occurred between these viruses although the two groups of viruses differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein the gene s encoding this protein showed no evidence of positive selection or of an elevated mutation rate rather the data suggested that recombination events have homogenized the portions of the genome other than the s gene between the two groups of viruses while continuing to maintain the two distinct anciently diverged versions of the s gene the latter hypothesis was supported by a phylogeny of s proteins from representative coronaviruses in which s proteins of aibv and tcov fell in the same clade electronic supplementary material the online version of this article
a murine model to study enteritis induced by bovine brv and murine rotavirus mrv has been developed the course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological immunohistochemical and electron microscopic methods both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with mrv or brv and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation hpi period following infection with lo4 pfu of virus diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction as measured by xylose absorption did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10-15 hpi immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5-8 hpi the appearance of diarrhea1 symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated the disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 x 10' pfuimouse of brv and 1 x 10' pfu/mouse of mrv on the basis of these results mrv was found to be more virulent than brv in this model the model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies this work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model 0 1989 academic press ii-s 186
the success of lentiviral vectors in curing fatal genetic and acquired diseases has opened a new era in human gene therapy however variability in the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic approach has been reported in human patients consequently lentiviral-vector-based gene therapy is limited to incurable human diseases with little understanding of the underlying causes of adverse effects and poor efficacy to assess the role that host genetic variation has on efficacy of gene therapy we characterized lentiviral-vector gene therapy within a set of 12 collaborative cross mouse strains lentiviral vectors carrying the firefly luciferase cdna under the control of a liver-specific promoter were administered to female mice with total-body and hepatic luciferase expression periodically monitored through 41 weeks post-vector administration vector copy number per diploid genome in mouse liver and spleen was determined at the end of this study we identified major strain-specific contributions to overall success of transduction vector biodistribution maximum luciferase expression and the kinetics of luciferase expression throughout the study our results highlight the importance of genetic variation on gene-therapeutic efficacy provide new models with which to more rigorously assess gene therapy approaches and suggest that redesigning preclinical studies of gene-therapy methodologies might be appropriate
feline infectious peritonitis fip continues to be one of the most researched infectious diseases of cats the relatively high mortality of fip especially for younger cats from catteries and shelters should be reason enough to stimulate such intense interest however it is the complexity of the disease and the grudging manner in which it yields its secrets that most fascinate researchers feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years after a half century fip remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease how can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen what are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form wet or dry and outcome death or resistance why is it so difficult and perhaps impossible to develop a vaccine for fip what role do genetics play in disease susceptibility this review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions although much has been learned about fip in the last 5 years the ultimate answers remain for yet more studies
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov has emerged in several pig-raising countries and has been a causative pathogen associated with diarrheal diseases in south korea since 2014 in the present study we were able to isolate and cultivate a korean pdcov strain knu16-07 in cell culture and investigate its pathogenicity pdcov-inoculated piglets showed watery diarrhea accompanied by acute enteritis in the natural host sequencing analysis demonstrated the genetic stability of knu16-07 for at least thirty serial passages
coronaviruses of potential recombinant origin with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev referred to as a new subtype iib of canine coronavirus ccov were recently identifi ed in dogs in europe to assess the distribution of the tgev-like ccov subtype during 2001-2008 we tested fecal samples from dogs with gastroenteritis of 1172 samples 493 42.06% were positive for ccov ccov-ii was found in 218 samples and ccov-i and ccov-ii genotypes were found in 182 approximately 20% of the samples with ccov-ii had the tgev-like subtype detection rates varied according to geographic origin the highest and lowest rates of prevalence for ccov-ii infection were found in samples from hungary and greece 96.87% and 3.45% respectively sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the ccov-iib strains were related to prototype tgev-like strains in the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the spike protein gene
background during the erythrocytic cycle plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites express p falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 pfemp1 that anchor the infected erythrocytes ie to the vascular lining of the host the cidrα1 domain of pfemp1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein c receptor epcr and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths in high transmission regions children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections this immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting pfemp1 causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen the development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the cidrα1 protein family altogether this identifies cidrα1 as an important vaccine target however the antigenic diversity of the cidrα1 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development methods immune responses in mice vaccinated with virus-like particles vlp presenting cidrα1 antigens were investigated antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant cidrα1 domains and the antibodies ability to inhibit epcr binding by the recombinant cidrα1 domains was tested in luminex-based multiplex assays results vlp-presented cidrα1.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong igg response capable of inhibiting epcr-binding of multiple cidrα1 domains mainly within the group a cidrα1.4-7 subgroups the study observations mirror those from previous cidrα1 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms this suggests that broad cidrα1 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of cidrα1 variants in addition this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible vlp vaccine platform
blood parasites of the sub-genus haemoproteus have been reported in seabirds in particular in species in the suliformes order these parasites are transmitted by hippoboscid flies of the genus olfersia strong specificity has been suggested between the vector and its vertebrate host we investigated the prevalence of haemoproteus infection in suliformes and hippoboscid flies in two oceanic islands of the western indian ocean europa and tromelin in total 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds fregata minor masked boobies sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies sula sula fortyone hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on europa tested positive for the presence of haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the pacific ocean and in the caribbean plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on europa however its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved we provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the western indian ocean and suggest that migrations between the pacific and the indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations citation bastien m jaeger a le corre m tortosa p lebarbenchon c 2014 haemoproteus iwa in great frigatebirds fregata minor in the islands of the western indian ocean plos one 95 e97185
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a highly contagious virus infecting pigs of all ages with high morbidity and mortality among newborn piglets currently there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from pedv the n-terminal subunit of spike protein s1 is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes thus we expressed and produced recombinant s1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows methods affinity tagged pedv s1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system purified recombinant protein was analysed by sds-page western blot and deglycosylation assay a pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing pedv-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by elisa and virus neutralization assays piglets were challenged orally with pedv and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge results and conclusion of three eukaryotic expression systems tested yeast insect-cell and mammalian expression by hek-293 t cells gave the highest yield of protein that was n-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of s1-specific igg and iga that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets also high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets after pedv challenge piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow however there were no significant differences in diarrhea body weight and virus shedding thus vaccination with s1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure and further improvements are needed for the development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against pedv infection
outbreaks of zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are not uncommon and an important component in containment of such emerging viral diseases is rapid and reliable diagnostics such methods are often pcr-based and hence require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen rattus norvegicus r norvegicus is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens transmission may be direct via contact with the animal for example through exposure to its faecal matter or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter n = 29 collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both dna and rna among other virus families we found sequences from members of the picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the boone cardiovirus and theiler's encephalomyelitis virus from this study we conclude that picornaviruses within r norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized the virome of r norvegicus should be investigated further to assess the full potential for zoonotic virus transmission
in order to predict pathogen emergence we must distinguish between emergence phenomena that occur via different processes focusing on the appearance of viral pathogens in new host species i outline a framework that uses specific molecular characteristics to rank virus families by their expected a priori ability to complete each of three steps in the emergence process encounter infection and propagation i then discuss the degree to which the patterns expected based solely on molecular-level structural characteristics agree with observations regarding the ability of animal viruses to infect humans this approach yields predictions consistent with empirical observations regarding the ability of specific viral families to infect novel host species but highlights the need for consideration of other factors such as the ecology of host interactions and the determinants of cellular susceptibility and permissivity to specific virus groups when trying to predict the frequency with which a virus will encounter a novel host species or the probability of propagation within a novel host species once infection has occurred
coronaviruses covs can cause mild to severe disease in humans and animals their host range and environmental spread seem to have been largely underestimated and they are currently being investigated for their potential medical relevance infectious bronchitis virus ibv belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of ibv is poorly understood in the present study we examined 1002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the beringia area for the presence of covs and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses we detected diverse covs by rt-pcr in wild birds in the beringia area sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to ibv these findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically we concluded that covs are widespread among wild birds in beringia and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised thus avian cov can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic covs considering the great animal health and economic impact of ibv as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as sarscoronavirus it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in cov infection biology and epidemiology
peninsula there are no approved antiviral therapies or vaccines available to treat or prevent severe disease associated with rvfv infection in humans the adenosine analog galidesivir bcx4430 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate with in vitro antiviral potency ec 50 of less than 50 μm in more than 20 different viruses across eight different virus families here we report on the activity of galidesivir in the hamster model of peracute rvfv infection intramuscular and intraperitoneal treatments effectively limited systemic rvfv strain zh501 infection as demonstrated by significantly improved survival outcomes and the absence of infectious virus in the spleen and the majority of the serum brain and liver samples collected from infected animals our findings support the further development of galidesivir as an antiviral therapy for use in treating severe rvfv infection and possibly other related phleboviral diseases
progress in combatting zoonoses that emerge from wildlife is often constrained by limited knowledge of the biology of pathogens within reservoir hosts we focus on the host-pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats hendra nipah ebola and marburg viruses spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections first pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts if lifelong immunity follows recovery viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration in either case new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool second epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity third pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors the three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different we outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health these concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans domestic animals and wildlife plos neglected tropical diseases | and members of the small mammals rapidd working group for discussions that helped• a limited knowledge of the biology of pathogens within reservoir hosts makes understanding predicting and managing zoonoses that emerge from wildlife very challenging.• one challenge is that different mechanisms can yield similar patterns in epidemiological data yet strategies to predict or manage spillover risk will be different for each therefore distinguishing among mechanisms driving disease dynamics in reservoir hosts may be critical for developing public health interventions
cellular and humoral immune responses of dogs to a candidate vaccine composed of leishmania braziliensis promastigote protein plus saponin as adjuvant have been investigated as a pre-requisite to understanding the mechanisms of immunogenicity against canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl the candidate vaccine elicited strong antigenicity related to the increases of anti-leishmania igg isotypes together with higher levels of lymphocytes particularly of circulating cd8 + t-lymphocytes and leishmania chagasi antigen-specific cd8 + t-lymphocytes as indicated by the intense cell proliferation and increased nitric oxide production during in vitro stimulation by l chagasi soluble antigens the candidate vaccine elicited an immune activation status potentially compatible with effective control of the etiological agent of cvl
ebola virus ebov a non-segmented single-stranded rna virus is often-most transmitted through body fluids like sweat tears saliva and nasal secretions till date there is no licensed vaccine of ebov is available in the market however the world is increasingly vulnerable to this emerging threat hence it is the need of time to develop a vaccine for ebov to hinder its dissemination the current study has been designed for identification and characterization of the potential b and t-cell epitopes using the immuno-informatics tools and it helped in finding the potent vaccine candidates against ebov prediction antigenicity and allergenicity testing of predicted b and t cells' epitopes was done as well to identify their potential as a vaccine candidate and to measure their safety level respectively among b-cell epitopes "wipagigvtgviia" showed a high antigenicity score and it would play an important role in evoking the immune response in t-cell epitopes peptides "aiglawipy" and "irgfprcry" presented high antigenicity score which binds to mhc class-i and mhc class-ii alleles respectively all predicted epitopes were analyzed and compared with already reported peptides carefully comparatively peptides predicted in the present study showed more immunogenicity score than already reported peptides used as positive control and are more immunogenic as compared to them
bats are reservoir hosts for a spectrum of infectious diseases some pathogens such as hendra nipah and marburg viruses appear to use mainly fruit bats as reservoir we describe designed immortalization of primary fetal cells from the egyptian fruit bat rousettus aegyptiacus to facilitate isolation and characterization of pathogens associated with these mammals three cell lines with different properties were recovered and successful immortalization was confirmed by continuous cultivation for over 18 months surprisingly the cell lines are fully permissive for a highly attenuated poxvirus modified vaccinia ankara mva mva is a safe and well characterized vaccine vector that cannot replicate in most mammalian cells high permissivity of rousettus cell lines could justify testing bats for susceptibility to mva as a replication competent vector with low zoonotic potential to induce herd immunity in bat colonies against viruses causing rabies or haemorrhagic fevers
in recent decades drugs used to treat malaria infection have been shown to be beneficial for many other diseases including viral infections in particular they have received special attention due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs against new emerging viruses i e hiv dengue virus chikungunya virus ebola virus etc or against classic infections due to drug-resistant viral strains i e human cytomegalovirus here we reviewed the in vitro/in vivo and clinical studies conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of four classes of antimalarial drugs artemisinin derivatives aryl-aminoalcohols aminoquinolines and antimicrobial drugs
equine rotaviruses were first detected in foals over 30 years ago and remain a major cause of infectious diarrhoea in foals during this time there has been substantial progress in the development of sensitive methods to detect rotaviruses in foals enabling surveillance of the genotypes present in various horse populations however there has been limited epidemiological investigation into the significance of these circulating genotypes their correlation with disease and the use of vaccination in these animal populations our knowledge of the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection in foals is based on a limited number of studies on a small number of foals and therefore most of our understanding in this area has been extrapolated from studies in other species questions such as the concentrations of rotavirus particles shed in the faeces of infected foals both with and without diarrhoea and factors determining the presence or absence of clinical disease remain to be investigated as does the relative and absolute efficacy of currently available vaccines the answer to these questions may help direct research into the development of more effective control measures ß
aquatic birds harbor diverse influenza a viruses and are a major viral reservoir in nature the recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new h17n10 subtype in central american fruit bats suggests that other new world species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses using consensus degenerate rt-pcr we identified a novel influenza a virus designated as h18n11 in a flat-faced fruit bat artibeus planirostris from peru serologic studies with the recombinant h18 protein indicated that several peruvian bat species were infected by this virus phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that in some gene segments new world bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined indicative of a long-standing host-virus association structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release suggesting a unique mode of influenza a virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells taken together these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses
with a global population of about 35 million in 47 countries dromedary camels play a crucial role in the economy of many marginal desert areas of the world where they survive under harsh conditions nonetheless there is scarce knowledge regarding camelsʼ parasite fauna which can reduce their milk and meat productions in addition only scattered information is available about zoonotic parasites transmitted to humans via contamination e g cryptosporidium spp giardia duodenalis balantidium coli blastocystis spp and enterocytozoon bieneusi as foodborne infections e g toxoplasma gondii trichinella spp and linguatula serrata or by arthropod vectors trypanosoma spp herein we draw attention of the scientific community and health policy-making organizations to the role camels play in the epidemiology of parasitic zoonotic diseases also in the view of an increase in their farming in desert areas worldwide
some highly pathogenic viruses such as chikungunya virus japanese encephalitis virus yellow fever virus dengue virus hanta virus sars-cov and h5n1 avian influenza virus can cause severe infectious diseases however the consensus method for detecting these viruses has not been well established a rapid and sensitive microarray approach for detection of these viruses and a panel of specific probes covering nine genera and 16 virus species were designed 70-mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50-mer oligonucleotides were at the species level respectively to decrease the interference of the host genome in hybridization the consensus genus primers were designed and used to reverse transcribe only virus genome the synthesis of the second strand was carried out with a random primer sequence 5 0 -gtttcccagtaggtctcnnnnnnnn-3 0 . the amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses this microarray-based method used the highly conserved consensus primers to synthesize specifically the virus cdna and could identify effectively chikungunya virus japanese encephalitis virus yellow fever virus dengue virus tick borne encephalitis virus and h5n1 avian influenza virus using this method one unknown virus isolated from pig brain in shanxi province china was identified this method may have an important potential application for the diagnosis of virus infection
virus-like particles vlps represent a promising vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov in this study recombinant baculovirus vacs and vacme were constructed to express the s protein and the m and e proteins of sars cov respectively electron microscope analysis demonstrated the formation of vlps in vacme and vacs coinfected insect cells mice immunized four times with vlps developed high antibody titres against sars cov in addition vlps elicited cell-mediated immunity as demonstrated by enhanced interferon-c and interleukin-4 production vlps also conferred protective immunity against the infection of spike protein pseudotyped murine leukaemia virus our findings demonstrate that sars cov vlps are immunogenic and can elicit strong sars cov-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice this is the first study describing the immunogenicity of sars cov vlps providing valuable data for developing a protective vaccine against sars cov infection
the virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans and still posed a serious threat to the global public health the virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics however there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential this study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences the k-nearest neighbor knn model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. even for the knn models built on the contigs as short as 1kb they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences this work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies

aim the kakamega forest western kenya has been biogeographically assigned to both lowland and montane forest biomes or has even been considered to be unique most frequently it has been linked with the guineo-congolian rain forest block the present paper aims to test six alternative hypotheses of the zoogeographical relationships between this forest remnant and other african forests using reptiles as a model group reptiles are relatively slow dispersers compared with flying organisms aves and odonata on which former hypotheses have been based and may thus result in a more conservative biogeographical analysis
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection is a highly contagious infectious disease causing watery diarrhea vomiting dehydration and high mortality rate in newborn piglets pedv infection can cause high economic losses in pig industry in japan a pedv outbreak occurred with high mortality from 2013 to 2015 even though until now pedv infection occurs sporadically for the control and monitoring of pedv infection not only symptomatic pigs but also asymptomatic pigs should be identified the objective of this study is to develop and optimize novel indirect elisa as a simple rapid sensitive and specific method for the detection of anti-pedv antibodies and evaluate the efficacy of the assay as a diagnostic method for ped results one hundred sixty-two serum samples consisting of 81 neutralization test nt positive and 81 nt negative sera were applied to the assay indirect elisa test based on whole virus antigen nk94p6 strain derived from vero cell culture was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic roc analysis with neutralization test nt as a reference method and cut-off value was determined as 0.320 with sensitivity and specificity of 92.6 and 90.1% respectively the area under curve auc was 0.949 indicating excellent accuracy of indirect elisa test there was significant positive correlation between indirect elisa and neutralization test r = 0.815 p < 0.05 furthermore the kappa statics showed the excellent agreement between these two tests kappa value = 0.815 in addition the sensitivity and specificity of preserved plates with different periods 1 day 2 weeks 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 months after drying antigen coated plates were 100% and 80-100% respectively conclusions the developed indirect elisa test in our study would be useful as a reliable test for serological survey and disease control of pedv infection and our pre-antigen coated elisa plates can be preserved at 4°c until at least 6 months
however the biological properties of these bat-derived influenza viruses bativs are still largely unknown since infectious viral particles have never been isolated from the infected host species in this study a reverse genetics approach was used to generate infectious bativ particles entirely from plasmids encoding full-length sequences in eight gene segments we inoculated bativ particles into various cell cultures including bat-derived cell lines and found that bativs infected particular batderived cells efficiently but not the other cell lines tested reassortant viruses between the two bativs were also successfully generated and their replication in the susceptible bat cell lines was confirmed these findings suggest a limited host range and reassortment potential of bativs in nature providing fundamental information for understanding of the ecology of bativs influenza a viruses iavs which belong to the family orthomyxoviridae cause highly contagious diseases in a wide variety of avian and mammalian species including humans pigs horses dogs and poultry and are recognized as one of the most important zoonotic pathogens iavs have 8 segmented negative-sense rna genomes and are divided into subtypes based on combination of two viral envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na iavs with h1-16 ha and n1-9 na subtypes have been identified in wild aquatic birds especially migratory ducks the natural reservoir of iavs 1-4 . importantly due to their propensity for genetic reassortment a variety of iav subtypes are distributed in many host species recently influenza virus-like rna genomes were detected in fruit bats sturnira lilium and artibeus planirostris in central and south america 56 . since the amino acid sequences of their ha and na are distinct from those of all previously known iav subtypes these bat-derived influenza viruses bativs were provisionally designated h17n10 and h18n11 however previous studies have reported that h17 ha does not bind to sialic acids linked to galactose in sugar chains 7 which are known as canonical receptors of iavs and that n10 na lacks neuraminidase activity 8 which is also a common property of all known influenza viruses thus bativ glycoproteins have also been called ha-like hl and na-like nl i e hl17nl10 and hl18nl11 9 . however information on the biological properties of these bativs is limited since infectious virus particles have never been isolated from infected animals bats belonging to the order chiroptera which is known as the second largest order of mammalians are distributed into more than 1000 species globally 10 . it has been shown that bats play crucial roles as natural reservoirs of some zoonotic pathogens such as marburg virus hendra virus nipah virus lyssa virus sars and mers coronaviruses 11-14 . thus it is important to investigate the ecology of bat-derived pathogens and to clarify their potential risks as zoonotic pathogens our previous study revealed that vesicular stomatitis viruses vsvs pseudotyped with bativ glycoproteins efficiently infected cultured cells derived from particular bat species e g miniopterus fuliginosus but not those commonly used for iav propagation and other bat cells tested providing key information on cell lines that are published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/
in the cerebrospinal fluid igg of five patients with lymphomeningoradiculitis bannwarth's syndrome and radiculomyelitis studied by immunoblot technique an oligoclonal pattern was found most of these oligoclonal bands were specific for borrelia burgdorferi in patients suffering from chronic meningoradiculomyelitis repeated csf examination by this technique showed persistent secretion of identical igg bands thus the specific humoral immune response and the disease activity could be documented over the course of the disease
evermann j f mckeirnan a j and ott r l 1991 perspectives on the epizootiology of feline enteric coronavirus and the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis vet microbiol 28 243-255 this review presents some current thoughts regarding the epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and feline coronavirus fecv with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature although the mechanism s whereby fipv causes disease are still incompletely understood there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of fipv and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research the first involves the hypothesis originally promulgated by pedersen in 1981 that fipv is derived from fecv during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract the second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systemic immunity in the case of fipv infection we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level once oral tolerance is disrupted fipv is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death thus it may be that clinical forms of fip are due to a combination of two events the first being the generation of fipv from fecv and the second being the capacity of fipv to circumvent oral tolerance
malaria infection starts with the injection of motile plasmodium sporozoites into the host's skin during a mosquito bite previous studies using the rodent malaria model indicate that the dermal inoculation site may be where sporozoites are most vulnerable to antibodies yet functional in vivo assays with human malaria parasites are lacking here we present the first characterization of p falciparum sporozoites in the skin comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species and investigating whether the environment of its natural host influences p falciparum sporozoite motility using a human skin xenograft model the combined data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages the skin is not a species-specific barrier for plasmodium we observe that p falciparum sporozoites inoculated into mouse skin move with similar speed displacement and duration and enter blood vessels in similar numbers as the rodent parasites thus interventions targeting p falciparum sporozoite migration can be tested in the murine dermis importantly to streamline quantification of sporozoite motility we developed a toolbox allowing for automated detection and tracking of sporozoites in intravital microscopy videos this establishes a platform to test vaccine candidates immunization protocols monoclonal antibodies and drug candidates for their impact on human malaria sporozoites in vivo screening of intervention strategies for in vivo efficacy against pf sporozoites using this new platform will have the potential to validate targets prior to expensive clinical trials
high-frequency alleles and/or co-occurring human leukocyte antigen hla alleles across loci appear to be more important than individual alleles because they might be markers of disease risk that have clinical value as biomarkers for targeted screening or the development of new therapies to better elucidate the major histocompatibility complex background and to facilitate the experimental use of cynomolgus macaques mafa-b mafa-dqb1 and mafa-drb alleles were characterized and their combinations were investigated from 30 macaques of vietnamese origin by cloning and sequencing a total of 48 mafa-b 22 mafa-dqb1 and 42 mafa-drb alleles were detected in this study respectively in addition two mafa-dqb1 and eight mafa-drb alleles represented novel sequences that had not been documented in earlier studies our results also showed that the macaque from vietnam might be valuable because ͼ30% of the test animals possessed mafa-drb*w304 30% and -dqb1*0616 30%. we report that the combination of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and ii alleles including the combination of drb3*0403-drb*w304 drb1*1013-drb*w304 and mafa-b*0070101-drb*w304 which was in 17% 13% and 13% of the animals respectively interesting more than two mafa-dqb1 alleles detected in one animal in this study suggest that mafa-dqb1 like mafa-drb might be a duplication in the chromosome which have ever been documented in cynomolgus monkeys but has not yet been observed in rhesus macaques or other primates our results for the high frequency of commonly co-occurring mhc alleles across loci in a cohort of the vietnamese cynomolgus macaque emphasized the value of this species as a model for biomedical research ᭧
canine enteric coronavirus ccov is an alphacoronavirus infecting dogs that is closely related to enteric coronaviruses of cats and pigs while ccov has traditionally caused mild gastro-intestinal clinical signs there are increasing reports of lethal ccov infections in dogs with evidence of both gastrointestinal and systemic viral dissemination consequently ccov is now considered to be an emerging infectious disease of dogs in addition to the two known serotypes of ccov novel recombinant variants of ccov have been found containing spike protein n-terminal domains ntds that are closely related to those of feline and porcine strains the increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel ccovs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one ccov type in the same host

feline coronaviruses comprise multiple strains or biotypes that differ in their pathogenic potential and organ tropism . the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv strains have probably evolved from feline enteric coronaviruses fecv by mutations or recombination events . fecv causes rather inapparent infections and can induce mild enteritis in kittens by contrast fipv induces an array of clinical diseases with high mortality which are characterised by inflammatory changes in
hantaviruses are hosted by rodents insectivores and bats several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the americas it is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases however in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur despite these limitations recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus/reservoir relationships
canine respiratory coronavirus crcov has recently been detected in dogs it is a group 2 coronavirus showing similarity to bovine coronavirus bcov but is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus cecov crcov may play an important role in canine infectious respiratory disease cird either by predisposing to further and potentially more serious viral and bacterial infections or possibly as a primary pathogen the prevalence of serum antibodies to crcov in a population of dogs in the south east of england has been shown previously to be 30.1% on the first day of entry to a rehoming kennel . the purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of crcov in the general canine population within as well as outside the uk an elisa used to test for the presence of antibodies to crcov in canine serum samples identified seropositive dogs in uk usa canada republic of ireland and greece the development of an elisa based on crcov antigen and immunofluorescence assay are described here 54.7% 547/1000 of north american and 36.0% 297/824 of united kingdom dogs were seropositive for crcov the age and geographical distribution of seropositive dogs was also assessed the cross-reactivity demonstrated between crcovantibodies from different countries and a uk viral isolate suggests immunological similarity the overall prevalence of this virus in both north america and the uk suggests that crcov has international significance and that further epidemiological studies are required #
plastid transformation has to date been applied to the expression of heterologous genes involved in agronomic traits and to the production of useful recombinant proteins here we report a feasibility study for producing the human b-site app cleaving enzyme bace via transformation of tobacco chloroplasts stable integration of human bace into the plastome was confirmed by pcr genomic southern blot analysis detected the presence of the tobacco aada and human bace genes between trni and trna in the plastome northern blot analysis revealed that the aada and bace genes were both properly transcribed into a dicistronic transcriptional unit human bace protein expression in transplastomic tobacco was determined by western blot analysis elisa analysis revealed that based on a dilution series of e coli-derived bace as a standard transplastomic lines accumulated bace to levels of 2.0% of total soluble proteins when mice were gavaged with the transplastomic tobacco extracts they showed an immune response against the bace antigen the successful production of plastid-based bace protein has the potential for developing a plant-based vaccine against alzheimer disease
human papilloma virus hpv is the primary etiological agent responsible for cervical cancer in women although in total 16 high-risk hpv strains have been identified so far currently available commercial vaccines are designed by targeting mainly hpv16 and hpv18 viral strains as these are the most common strains associated with cervical cancer because of the high level of antigenic specificity of hpv capsid antigens the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk hpv strains due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other hpv high-risk strains other than hpv16 and 18 it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable cd8 t-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains with this aim we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade cd8 t-cell hpv vaccine candidates by considering e1 e2 e6 and e7 proteins from all the highrisk hpv strains we have identified a set of 14 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments that are supposed to provide protection against infection from any of the high-risk hpv strains across globe
background a growing concern has raised regarding the pandemic potential of the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 viruses consequently there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the divergent h5n1 influenza viruses in the present study we designed a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide map-based vaccine designated m2e-map which contains the sequence overlapping the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 m2e of a hpai h5n1 virus and investigated its immune responses and cross-protection against different clades of h5n1 viruses results our results showed that m2e-map vaccine induced strong m2e-specific igg antibody responses following 3-dose immunization of mice with m2e-map in the presence of freunds' or aluminium alum adjuvant m2e-map vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated histopathological damage in the challenged mouse lungs the m2e-map-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1 vn/1194 and clade2.3.4 sz/406h h5n1 virus challenge being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of h5n1 viruses conclusions these results suggest that m2e-map presenting m2e of h5n1 virus has a great potential to be developed into an effective subunit vaccine for the prevention of infection by a broad spectrum of hpai h5n1 viruses
experimental infection of 2-day-old gnotobiotie lambs with lamb astrovirus produced mild diarrhoea after an incubation period of about 48 hours no other clinical symptoms developed infection was studied by immunofluorescent and histological examination of tissues from the lambs astroviruses infected only mature villus epithelial cells and subepithelial macrophages in the small intestine where they produced partial villus atrophy infected enterocytes were replaced with euboidal cells from the crypts and the lesion gradually healed by 5 days after infection no serological relationship was detected by immunofluorescence between lamb astrovirus antigen in gut sections and antisera to either calf or human astrovirus
background the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a trivalent vaccine mixture and compare it to the respective monovalent vaccines against mycoplasma hyopneumoniae porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv results pigs that were triple challenged with m hyopneumoniae pcv2 and prrsv following vaccination with the trivalent vaccine mixture exhibited a significantly better growth performance when compared to unvaccinated and challenged pigs a statistical difference was not found when comparing pig populations which were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine followed by a triple challenge and pigs vaccinated with monovalent m hyopneumoniae vaccine followed by mycoplasmal single challenge in the following areas m hyopneumoniae nasal shedding the number of m hyopneumoniae-specific interferon-γ secreting cells ifn-γ-sc and mycoplasmal lung lesion scores pigs vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine mixture followed by a triple challenge resulted in a similar reduction of pcv2 viremia an increase in the number of pcv2-specific ifn-γ-sc and reduction in interstitial lung lesion scores when compared to pigs vaccinated with a pcv-2 vaccine and challenged with pcv2 only lastly there was a significant difference in the reduction of prrsv viremia an increase in prrsv-specific ifn-γ-sc and a reduction of interstitial lung lesion scores between pigs vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine mixture followed by a triple challenge and pigs vaccinated with a monovalent prrsv vaccine followed by prrsv challenge only conclusion the trivalent vaccine mixture was efficacious against a triple challenge of m hyopneumoniae pcv2 and prrsv the trivalent vaccine mixture however did not result in equal protection when compared against each respective monovalent vaccine with the largest vaccine occurring within prrsv
a new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 hbov4 was genetically characterized among 641 feces samples obtained from children and adults the most commonly detected bocavirus species were in descending order hbov2 hbov3 hbov4 and hbov1 with an hbov2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in nigerian and tunisian children respectively hbov3 or hbov4 species were found in 12 of 192 patients with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis in tunisia and nigeria and 0 of 96 healthy tunisian contacts p p . evidence of extensive recombination at the np1 and vp1 gene boundary between and within bocavirus .01 species was found the high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces specimens relative to the highly homogeneous hbov1 suggest that this worldwide-distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory tract elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases including acute flaccid paralysis and diarrhea will require further epidemiological studies parvoviruses are small non-lipid-enveloped environmentally resistant viral particles with single-stranded linear dna genomes that frequently infect animals through the fecal-oral route . parvoviruses can cause numerous symptoms in animals including enteritis panleukopenia hepatitis erythrocyte aplasia and cerebellar ataxia . efficacious vaccines against animal parvovirus infections are widely employed .following the identification of the human parvovirus
animals that hunt and scavenge are often exposed to a broad array of pathogens theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores in light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization domestic cats felis catus are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes we used elisa and western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena ig epitopes molecular weights of heavy iga igg igm and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis and as expected they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins in order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin dnp-klh and serum anti-dnp responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for one year the full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to
rabies is progressive fatal encephalitis who estimates 55000 rabies deaths and more than 10 million pep every year world-wide a variety of cell-culture derived vaccines are available for prophylaxis against rabies however their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries where such cases are most often encountered this is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations dna vaccines being most promising amongst them here we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity these strategies include use of signal sequences namely tissue plasminogen activator tpa ubiquitin uq and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 lamp-1 tpa lamp-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the cd4 + t cell and antibody response in contrast the uq tag was utilized for enhancing cd8 + response the potency of modified dna vaccines assessed by total antibody response antibody isotypes cytokine profile neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity interestingly the dna vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response in conclusion our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies
loss of genetic variation may render populations more vulnerable to pathogens due to inbreeding depression and depletion of variation in genes responsible for immunity against parasites here we review the evidence for the significance of variation in genes of the major histocompatibility complex mhc for conservation efforts mhc molecules present pathogen-derived antigens to the effector cells of the immune system and thus trigger the adaptive immune response some mhc genes are the most variable functional genes in the vertebrate genome their variation is clearly of adaptive significance and there is considerable evidence that its maintenance is mainly due to balancing selection imposed by pathogens however while the evidence for selection shaping mhc variation on the historical timescale is compelling a correlation between levels of mhc variation and variation at neutral loci is often observed indicating that on a shorter timescale drift also substantially affects mhc leading to depletion of mhc diversity the evidence that the loss of mhc variation negatively affects population survival is so far equivocal and difficult to separate from effects of general inbreeding some species with depleted mhc variation seem to be particularly susceptible to infection but other species thrive and expand following severe bottlenecks that have drastically limited their mhc variation however while the latter demonstrate that mhc variation is not always critical for population survival these species may in fact represent rare examples of survival despite of the loss of mhc variation there is clearly a compelling need for data that would disclose the possible consequences of mhc diversity for population viability in particular we need more data on the impact of mhc allelic richness on the abundance of parasites or prevalence of disease in populations while controlling for the role of general inbreeding before such evidence accumulates captive breeding programs and other conservation measures aimed at inbreeding avoidance should be favoured over those protecting only mhc variation especially since inbreeding avoidance programs would usually conserve both types of genetic diversity simultaneously
the filoviruses which include the marburg-and ebolaviruses have caused multiple outbreaks among humans this decade antibodies against the filovirus surface glycoprotein gp have been shown to provide life-saving therapy in nonhuman primates but such antibodies are generally virus-specific many monoclonal antibodies mabs have been described against ebola virus in contrast relatively few have been described against marburg virus here we present ten mabs elicited by immunization of mice using recombinant mucin-deleted gps from different marburg virus marv strains surprisingly two of the mabs raised against marv gp also cross-react with the mucin-deleted gp cores of all tested ebolaviruses ebola sudan bundibugyo reston but these epitopes are masked differently by the mucin-like domains themselves the most efficacious mabs in this panel were found to recognize a novel "wing" feature on the gp2 subunit that is unique to marburg and does not exist in ebola two of these anti-wing antibodies confer 90 and 100% protection respectively one hour post-exposure in mice challenged with marv

cases of acute respiratory tract infection caused by pteropine orthoreovirus prv of the genus orthoreovirus family reoviridae have been reported in southeast asia where it was isolated from humans and bats it is possible that prv-associated respiratory infections might be prevalent in southeast asia the clinical course of prv is not fully elucidated the virulence pathology and pathogenesis of two prv strains a human-borne prv strain isolated from a patient who returned to japan from bali indonesia in 2007 and a batborne prv isolated from a bat in the philippines in 2013 were investigated in balb/c mice using virological pathological and immunological study methods the intranasal inoculation of balb/c mice with human-borne prv caused respiratory infection in addition all mice with immunity induced by pre-inoculation with a non-lethal dose of prv were completely protected against lethal prv infection mice treated with antiserum with neutralizing antibody activity after inoculation with a lethal dose of prv showed a reduced fatality rate in this mouse model bat-borne prv caused respiratory infection similar to human-borne prv prv caused lethal respiratory disease in an animal model of prv infection in which balb/c mice were used the balb/c mouse model might help to accelerate research on the virulence of prv and be useful for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents and vaccines for the treatment and plos neglected tropical diseases | https//doi org/10.1371/journal pntd prevention of prv infection prv was shown for the first time to be a causative virus of respiratory disease on the basis of koch's postulations by the additional demonstration that prv caused respiratory disease in mice through their intranasal inoculation with prv it is assumed that pteropine orthoreovirus prv is a causative agent of acute respiratory tract infection rti in humans prv was isolated from patients and fruit bats in southeast asia furthermore the genome of prv was detected in patients with respiratory symptoms suggesting that prv causes rti in humans there is a potential for prv to cause rtis in tropical or sub-tropical regions in southeast asia more widely than thought the virulence pathology and pathogenesis of prv in balb/c mice were elucidated in detail to develop specific countermeasures and prophylactics against prv infection an animal model of lethal prv infection is needed and we developed such a model using balb/c mice this model allows investigation of the pathogenicity of prv and evaluation of the efficacy of drugs and vaccines and might help to accelerate research on the virology of prv development of an animal infection model for prv plos neglected tropical diseases | https//doi org/10
background diarrhea is one of the most common clinical symptoms reported in companion animal clinics dog circovirus dogcv is a new mammalian circovirus that is considered to be a cause of alimentary syndromes such as diarrhea vomiting and hemorrhagic enteritis dogcv has previously only been identified in the united states italy germany genebank accession number kf887949 and china genebank accession number kt946839 therefore the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of dogcv in taiwan and to explore the correlation between diarrhea and dogcv infection clinical specimens were collected between 2012 and 2014 from 207 dogs suffering from diarrhea and 160 healthy dogs results in this study we developed a sensitive and specific sybr green-based real-time pcr assays to detected dogcv in naturally infected animals of the analyzed fecal samples from diarrheal dogs and health dogs 58 28.0 % and 19 11.9 % respectively were dogcv positive the difference in dogcv prevalence was highly significant p = 0 0002755 in diarrheal dogs conclusions this is the first study to reveal that dogcv is currently circulating in domestic dogs in taiwan and to demonstrate its high detection rate in dogs with diarrhea
background rift valley fever rvf is endemic to the tropical regions of eastern and southern africa the seroprevalence of rvf was investigated among the human population in borno state nigeria to determine the occurrence of the disease in the study area in comparison with that of lassa fever and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever methods recombinant nucleoprotein rnp-based igg-elisas for the detection of serum antibodies against rvf virus rvfv lassa fever virus lasv and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv were used to test human sera in borno state nigeria the presence of neutralizing antibody against the rvfv-glycoprotein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype rvfvpv was also determined in the human sera of the 297 serum samples tested 42 14.1% were positive for the presence of rvfv-igg and 22 7.4% and 7 2.4% of the serum samples were positive for antibodies against lasv and cchfv respectively there was a positive correlation between the titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained using rvfvpv and those obtained using the conventional neutralization assay with the attenuated rvfv-mp12 strain conclusions the seroprevalence of rvf was significantly higher than that of lasv and cchf in borno state nigeria the rvfvpv-based neutralization assay developed in this study has the potential to replace the traditional assays based on live viruses for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological studies of rvf
to investigate the efficacy of intracerebral ic immunization in preventing viral spread in the brain we immunized mice with inactivated rabies virus via the subcutaneous sc or ic route followed by administration of a lethal dose of rabies virus challenge virus standard strain directly into the brains of immunized mice progressive paralytic neurological signs were observed in control and 75% of sc immunized mice whereas only 20% of ic immunized mice exhibited symptoms neutralizing antibody titers in blood plasma were significantly elevated in sc and ic immunized mice with the highest levels seen in ic immunized mice analysis of whole brain lysates revealed a strong induction of immunoglobulin in the brains of ic immunized mice that had virus neutralizing activity histopathological examination of brain tissue revealed mild encephalitis and disseminated viral antigen in control and sc immunized mice but rare in ic immunized mice these results suggest that ic immunization induces a preventive humoral immune response against intracerebrally inoculated rabies virus induction of neutralizing antibody in cerebrospinal fluid represents a putative therapeutic measure for the treatment of rabid animals and humans
disease exacerbation was observed in pigs challenged with virulent porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv following immunisation with a recombinant gp5 sub-unit prrsv vaccine rgp5 produced in e coli eighteen animals were divided into three experimental groups group a were immunised twice im with rgp5 21 days apart group b acted as positive controls challenged but not immunised and group c were negative controls pigs in groups a and b were challenged 21 days after the second immunisation of the group a animals following challenge three pigs given rgp5 exhibited more severe clinical signs than the positive controls including respiratory distress and progressive weight-loss although not statistically significant the more severe disease exhibited by group a animals may suggest previous immunisation as a contributory factor the mechanisms of these findings remain unclear and no association could be established between the severity of disease non-neutralising antibody concentrations and tissue viral loads
antimicrobial resistance is of primary importance regarding public and animal health issues persistence and spread of resistant strains within a population contribute to the maintenance of a reservoir and lead to treatment failure an experimental trial was carried out to study the horizontal transmission of a fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli strain from inoculated to naïve pigs all naïve contact pigs had positive counts of fluoroquinolone-resistant e coli after only two days of contact moreover re-infections of inoculated pigs caused by newly contaminated animals were suspected a maximum likelihood method based on a susceptible-infectious-susceptible sis model was used to determine the transmission parameters two transmission levels were identified depending on the quantity of bacteria shed by infected individuals i low-shedders with bacterial counts of resistant e coli in the faeces between 5*10 3 and 10 6 cfu/g b l = 0.41 ii high shedders with bacterial counts above 10 6 cfu/g b h = 0.98 . hence transmission between animals could be pivotal in explaining the persistence of resistant bacteria within pig herds
porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pdev can cause severe diarrhea in pigs development of effective vaccines against tgev and pedv is one of important prevention measures the spike s protein is the surface glycoprotein of tgev and pedv which can induce specific neutralization antibodies and is a candidate antigen for vaccination attempts in this study the open reading frames of the tgev s1 protein and in addition of the s or s1 proteins of pedv were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pires resulting in recombinant plasmids pires-tgev-s1-pedv-s1 and pires-tgev-s1-pedv-s subsequently 6-8 weeks old kunming mice were inoculated with both dna plasmids lymphocyte proliferation assay virus neutralization assay ifn-c assay and ctl activity assay were performed tgev/pedv specific antibody responses as well as kinetic changes of t lymphocyte subgroups of the immunized mice were analyzed the results showed that the recombinant dna plasmids increased the proliferation of t lymphocytes and the number of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocyte subgroups in addition the dna vaccines induced a high level of ifn-c in the immunized mice the specific ctl activity in the pires-tgev-s1-pedv-s group became significant at 42 days postimmunization at 35 days post-immunization the recombinant dna plasmids bearing full-length s genes of tgev and pedv stimulated higher levels of specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice
astroviruses cause disease in a variety of species yet little is known about the epidemiology of a majority of astroviruses including porcine astrovirus type 3 poastv3 which is a putative cause of polioencephalomyelitis in swine accordingly a cross-sectional study was conducted on sow farms with or without reported poastv3-associated neurologic disease in growing pigs weaned from those farms additionally a conveniently selected subset of piglets from one farm was selected for gross and histologic evaluation the distribution of poastv3 in the enteric system was evaluated through in situ hybridization poastv3 as detected by rt-qpcr on fecal samples was frequently detected across sows and piglets 66-90% on all farms 65-85%. poastv3 was detected subsequently at a similar detection frequency 77% vs 85% on one farm after three months viral shedding as determined by the cycle quantification value suggests that piglets shed higher quantities of virus than adult swine no link between gastrointestinal disease and poastv3 was found however poastv3 was detected by in situ in myenteric plexus neurons of piglets elucidating a possible route of spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system these data suggest poastv3 has endemic potential is shed in the feces at greater quantities by suckling piglets when compared to sows and infection is widespread on farms in which it is detected
monoclonal antibodies to group a rotavirus vp6 protein were prepared and used for verification of three blocking enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa modifications to detect rotavirus a selected competitive blocking elisa cb-elisa and electron microscopy em were used for examination of 194 field faecal samples of piglets affected with diarrhoea rotavirus was detected in 43 samples 22.2% by cb-elisa method whereas in 26 13.4% samples by em examination however of 26 samples positive by em rotavirus a was detected by cb-elisa in 19 73.1% samples indicating the share of group a rotavirus in all cases of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus the sensitivity and specificity of the cb-elisa was verified both by inclusion of control samples containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv in each analysis and by comparative examination of samples with the commercial elisa kit the cb-elisa sensitivity was positively affected by examination of samples in the presence of chelating agent u s

hantaviruses have previously been recognised to cause two separate syndromes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps in the americas however increasing evidence suggests that this dichotomy is no longer fruitful when recognising human hantavirus disease and understanding the pathogenesis herein are presented three cases of severe european puumala hantavirus infection that meet the hps case definition the clinical and pathological findings were similar to those found in american hantavirus patients consequently hantavirus infection should be considered as a cause of acute respiratory distress in all endemic areas worldwide
in chinese meishan/german landrace cross-bred swine f 2 generation interferon gamma ifn-g production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc was determined directly ex vivo at different time points after survival of a virulent pseudorabies virus prv infection this reactivity was compared with the reactivity of naïve pbmc significant ifn-g production was determined in elisa and elispot only after in vitro pbmc re-stimulation with prv and not with the closely related bovine herpesvirus bhv-1 the prv-specific ifn-g secretion from re-stimulated pbmc showed high levels 6 days after infection before the presence of serum antibodies and it persisted at a high level over a 3 months period the response of a group of eight piglets infected intranasally with prv varied only two animals showed the expected typical fever response prv specific ifn-g production by pbmc clearly indicated that infection had occurred early significant ifn-g production by primed pbmc turned out to be a reliable and specific ex vivo marker for cellular response against productive prv infection in swine before antibody formation #
this paper deals with a method of using unknown serum as the first antibody to coat wells of the microtiter plate directly in application of the sandwich elisa method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus this method was used for assay of the antibody against adult rotavirus in 1380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of china of which 141 showed a positive result with a total positive rate of 10.2%. the infection rate varied in different regions in order to confirm the accuracy of these results a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive specimens and the results revealed that the p/n ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking seventeen of these 25 positive serum specimens were obtained from rural areas of qian'an county hebei province where epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred two years ago the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus was not detected in 50 adult sera from xizang autonomous region only one out of 50 adult sera from hainan island was positive for the antibody modified elisa for assay of antibody antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus sera of healthy adult ~_
dna vaccines present one of the most cost-effective platforms to develop global vaccines which have been tested for nearly three decades in preclinical and clinical settings with some success in the clinic however one of the major challenges for the development of dna vaccines is their poor immunogenicity in humans which has led to refinements in dna delivery dosage in prime/boost regimens and the inclusion of adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity in this review we focus on adjuvants that can enhance the immunogenicity of dna encoded antigens and highlight the development of a novel cytolytic dna platform encoding a truncated mouse perforin the application of this innovative dna technology has considerable potential in the development of effective vaccines
the persistent public health threat of infection with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov highlights the need for an effective mers-cov vaccine previous studies have focused mainly on the receptor-binding domain rbd on the spike protein of mers-cov herein we investigated the immunogenicity and protective potential of the recombinant n-terminal domain rntd of spike proteins as a vaccine candidate balb/c mice vaccinated with 5 or 10 lg of rntd protein demonstrated a significant humoral immune response serum igg and neutralizing activity additionally according to the enzyme-linked immunospot intracellular cytokine staining and cytometric bead array assays significant and functional t-cell immunity was induced by 10 lg of the rntd vaccination with aluminum and cpg adjuvant furthermore rntd-immunized mice showed reduced lung abnormalities in a mers-covchallenge mouse model transfected with an adenoviral vector expressing human dpp4 showing protection consistent with that found with rrbd vaccination these data show that rntd induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and that it demonstrated protective capacity against a viral challenge indicating that rntd is a vaccine candidate against mers-cov infection
feline and primate immunodeficiency viruses fivs sivs and hiv are transmitted via direct contact e g fighting sexual contact and mother-offspring transmission this dynamic likely poses a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild recently several host intracellular anti-viral proteins that contribute to species-specificity of primate lentiviruses have been identified revealing adaptive mechanisms that further limit spread of lentiviruses between species consistent with these inter-species transmission barriers phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that fiv transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings recently we documented that puma and bobcats in southern california share an fiv strain providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins these studies are facilitated by the availability of the 2x cat genome sequence annotation in addition concurrent viral and host genetic analyses have been used to track patterns of migration of the host species and barriers to transmission of the virus within the african lion these studies illustrate the utility of fiv as a model to discover the variables necessary for establishment and control of lentiviral infections in new species
the right hand end nde i fragment 3 90.8-100 map units of the fowl adenovirus serotype 10 fav-10 was characterised so as to allow the location of an insertion site for recombinant vector construction infectious bursal disease virus ibdv vp2 gene from the australian classical strain 002/73 under the control of the fav-10 major late promoter/leader sequence mlp/ls was inserted into a unique not i site that was generated at 99.5 map units this recombinant virus was produced without deletion of any portion of the fav-10 genome when administered to specific pathogen free spf chickens intravenously intraperitoneally subcutaneously or intramuscularly it was shown that the fav-10/vp2 recombinant induced a serum vp2 antibody response and protected chickens against challenge with ibdv v877 an intermediate virulent classical strain birds were not protected when the recombinant was delivered via the conjunctival sac
streptococcus pneumoniae is the main bacterial pathogen involved in pneumonia pneumococcal acquisition and colonization density is probably affected by viral co-infections the local microbiome composition and mucosal immunity here we report the interactions between live-attenuated influenza vaccine laiv successive pneumococcal challenge and the healthy adult nasal microbiota and mucosal immunity using an experimental human challenge model nasal microbiota profiles at baseline are associated with consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome non-carrier low-dense and high-dense pneumococcal carriage independent of laiv co-administration corynebacterium/dolosigranulumdominated profiles are associated with low-density colonization lowest rates of natural viral co-infection at baseline and post-laiv influenza replication are detected in the low-density carriers also we detected the fewest microbiota perturbations and mucosal cytokine responses in the low-density carriers compared to non-carriers or high-density carriers these results indicate that the complete respiratory ecosystem affects pneumococcal behaviour following challenge with low-density carriage representing the most stable ecological state
cryptosporidium and giardia spp are small coccidian veterinary diagnostic laboratory at colorado state university samples were evaluated using the merifluor xu cryptosporidium/giardia direct immunofluorescent detection procedure one horse 0.33% was detected positive for cryptosporidium and two horses 0.66% were positive for giardia the low prevalence of cryptosporidia and giardia in the trail horse population surveyed indicates that the adult recreational trail horse population is not likely to be a significant source of cryptosporidium and giardia environmental contamination in watershed areas
it is well known that mucosal tissues contain the largest surface area of the human body and are the front line of natural host defense against various pathogens in fact more than 80% of infectious disease pathogens probably gain entry into the susceptible human hosts through open mucosal surfaces human immunodeficiency virus type one hiv-1 a mainly sexually transmitted virus also primarily targets the vaginal and gastrointestinal mucosa as entry sites for viral transmission seeding replication and amplification since hiv-1 establishes its early replication in vaginal or rectal mucosal tissues the induction of sufficient mucosal immunity at the initial site of hiv-1 transmission becomes essential for a protective vaccine however despite the fact that current conventional vaccine strategies have remained unsuccessful in preventing hiv-1 infection sufficient financial support and resources have yet to be given to develop a vaccine able to elicit protective mucosal immunity against sexual transmissions interestingly chinese ancestors invented variolation through intranasal administration about one thousand years ago which led to the discovery of a successful smallpox vaccine and the final eradication of the disease it is the hope for all mankind that the development of a mucosal aids vaccine will ultimately help control the aids pandemic in order to discover an effective mucosal aids vaccine it is necessary to have a deep understanding of mucosal immunology and to test various mucosal vaccination strategies viruses 2010 2 284
aetiologies we used next generation sequencing ngs to investigate the possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis in puppies from a dog kennel in victoria australia the near complete genome of a canine astrovirus was obtained from pooled faecal samples and was found to be 94.7% identical with a canine astrovirus detected in the united kingdom in 2012 the phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene found similarities to those of canine astroviruses identified in italy in 2005 and in uk and hungary in 2012 but distant from that of a canine astrovirus previously identified in australia in 2012 thus different serotypes of canine astrovirus are likely circulating in australia the close relationship to european astroviruses also suggested that there had been recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses between australia and europe ngs also detected other infections in the puppies including several canine papillomaviruses and a canine parvovirus vaccine strain as well as a very low level of campylobacter canine astrovirus was the probable cause of diarrhoea in these puppies with the possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria ngs was effective as a non-targeted method to determine the likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis
has the most extensive geographic distribution of the medically important tickborne viral diseases closely approximating the known global distribution of hyalomma spp ticks human beings become infected through tick bites by crushing infected ticks after contact with a patient with cchf during the acute phase of infection or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock clinical features commonly show a dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage myalgia and fever the levels of liver enzymes creatinine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase are raised and bleeding markers are prolonged infection of the endothelium has a major pathogenic role besides direct infection of the endothelium indirect damage by viral factors or virus-mediated host-derived soluble factors that cause endothelial activations and dysfunction are thought to occur in diagnosis enzyme-linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr are used early diagnosis is critical for patient therapy and prevention of potential nosocomial infections supportive therapy is the most essential part of case management recent studies suggest that ribavirin is eff ective against cchf although defi nitive studies are not available healthcare workers have a serious risk of infection particularly during care of patients with haemorrhages from the nose mouth gums vagina and injection sites simple barrier precautions have been reported to be eff ective
while bats are often viewed as carriers of infectious disease agents little research has been conducted on the effects these potential pathogens may have on the bat populations themselves the southern bent-winged bat miniopterus orianae bassanii is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern australia population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years but the reasons for this are unclear as part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats miniopterus orianae oceanensis from three different locations the eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations at least six novel herpesviruses five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus were identified the prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats 44% 51/ 116 compared to southern bent-winged bats 27% 95/351 although this varied across the locations and sampling periods adenoviruses and a range of different rna viruses lyssaviruses filoviruses coronaviruses and henipaviruses were also tested for but not detected the detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bentwinged bat the detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses
low-pathogenicity avian influenza h9n2 remains an endemic disease worldwide despite continuous vaccination indicating the need for an improved vaccine strategy bacillus subtilis b subtilis a gram-positive and endosporeforming bacterium is a non-pathogenic species that has been used in probiotic formulations for both animals and humans the objective of the present study was to elucidate the effect of b subtilis spores as adjuvants in chickens administered inactivated avian influenza virus h9n2 herein the adjuvanticity of b subtilis spores in chickens was demonstrated by enhancement of h9n2 virus-specific igg responses b subtilis spores enhanced the proportion of b cells and the innate cell population in splenocytes from chickens administered both inactivated h9n2 and b subtilis spores spore + h9n2 furthermore the h9n2 and spore administration induced significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and il-6 compared to that in the h9n2 only group additionally total splenocytes from chickens immunized with inactivated h9n2 in the presence or absence of b subtilis spores were restimulated with inactivated h9n2 the subsequent results showed that the extent of antigen-specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cell proliferation was higher in the spore + h9n2 group than in the group administered only h9n2 taken together these data demonstrate that b subtilis spores as adjuvants enhance not only h9n2 virus-specific igg but also cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production this approach to vaccination with inactivated h9n2 together with a b subtilis spore adjuvant in chickens produces a significant effect on antigenspecific antibody and t cell responses against avian influenza virus.© the authors 2020 this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 4.0 international license which permits use sharing adaptation distribution and reproduction in any medium or format as long as you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons licence and indicate if changes were made the images or other third party material in this article are included in the article' s creative commons licence unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material if material is not included in the article'
recombinant proteins rn nucleocapsid and rh/nh hemagglutinin of the measles virus strain novo/96 of genotype a were obtained the immunobiological properties of the proteins were studied in the reaction with a panel of positive and negative sera balb/c mice were immunized with recombinant proteins and native antigen of the measles virus strain novo/96 in order to obtain hyperimmune serum and its analysis using elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and prn plaque reduction neutralization the hyperimmune sera against recombinant proteins and native antigen of the measles virus strain novo/96 were found to be highly active in elisa the antibodies against the proteins rn and rh/nh were found to be capable of neutralizing the virus in titer 1 13.5 and 1 22.9 respectively the neutralization titer of the antibodies generated against native antigen of the measles virus strain novo/96 was 1 25.7
licensed live attenuated virus vaccines capable of expressing transgenes from other pathogens have the potential to reduce the number of childhood immunizations by eliciting robust immunity to multiple pathogens simultaneously recombinant attenuated measles virus rmv derived from the edmonston zagreb vaccine strain was engineered to express simian immunodeficiency virus siv gag protein for the purpose of evaluating the immunogenicity of rmv as a vaccine vector in rhesus macaques rmv-gag immunization alone elicited robust measles-specific humoral and cellular responses but failed to elicit transgene gag-specific immune responses following aerosol or intratracheal/intramuscular delivery however when administered as a priming vaccine to a heterologous boost with recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 expressing the same transgene rmv-gag significantly enhanced gag-specific t lymphocyte responses following rad5 immunization gag-specific humoral responses were not enhanced however which may be due to either the transgene or the vector cellular response priming by rmv against the transgene was highly effective even when using a suboptimal dose of rad5 for the boost these data demonstrate feasibility of using rmv as a priming component of heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens for pathogens requiring strong cellular responses
astroviruses are small non-enveloped positive sense single-stranded rna viruses first identified in 1975 in children suffering from diarrhea and then described in a wide variety of animals to date the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22 animal species or families including domestic synantropic and wild animals avian and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments astrovirus infections are considered among the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children second only to rotavirus infections but in animals their association with enteric diseases is not well documented with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus infection genetic variability has been described in almost all astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds however antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses interestingly there is an increasing evidence of recombination events occurring in astroviruses which contributes to increase the genetic variability of this group of viruses a wide variety of species infected the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co -infection of the same host with different astroviruses this can also favor the emergence of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential after more than 30 years from their first description in humans there are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied astroviridae family in the present work we will review the existing knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals with particular focus on the molecular biology interspecies transmission and zoonotic potential of this group of viruses
background individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis we studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic uk cats using results of a real time pcr assay for 8 enteropathogenic species feline coronavirus co feline panleukopenia virus pa clostridium perfringens cl salmonella enterica sa giardia spp gi tritrichomonas foetus tr cryptosporidium spp cr and toxoplasma gondii to age gender breed and history were recorded pcr panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis results overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% co 22.1% pa 56.6% cl 0.8% sa 20.6% gi 18.8% tr 24.4% cr and 1.0% to prevalence of co gi and tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats dsh and prevalence decreased with increasing age for co pa gi cr and tr co-infection was common ≥2 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats and 13.3% of cats had ≥4 enteropathogens mean x enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 ±1.3 sd was significantly higher in pedigree cats x =2.51 compared to dsh x =1.68 and decreased with age x =2.64 <6 months x =1.68 for >1 yr more cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested 12.7% than expected when exact combinations of co-infection were examined tr tended to be found in combinations with co cl and gi conclusions multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats and case management needs to take this into account in contrast the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay
recombinant adenoviruses are currently the most important vector system in gene therapy adenoviruses frequently cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans and antiadenoviral antibodies are found in 35-70% of the population therefore in the majority of potential patients receiving adenoviral gene therapy the contact of virus particles and blood will lead to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes these complexes have the ability to induce inflammatory reactions via an activation of the complement system we have determined the level of c3a the most reactive complement component generated in isolated citrate plasma of healthy individuals after challenge with recombinant and wild-type adenoviruses in amounts corresponding to virus blood levels to be expected in patients during adenoviral gene therapy all plasma samples containing anti-adenoviral antibodies showed a substantial dose-dependent gener-
understanding the immune responses against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is important to prevent infection and to design control strategies we evaluated both systemic and mucosal immune responses to pedv in pigs and assessed if prior exposure to virus protects against re-infection three-week-old pigs were infected with pedv and immune response in blood intestine and mesenteric lymph node mln was evaluated at 30 dpi virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of pedv and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated we found that pedv rna persists in the intestine even after fecal shedding of the virus was stopped at 28 dpi and pigs previously exposed to pedv are protected from virus shedding after re-infection pedv infection induced both humoral and cell mediated immune response with an increase in pedv specific iga and igg antibodies in intestine and serum flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of b cells and lower frequency of t cells at 4 dpi the frequency of cd4/cd8 double positive dp memory t cells was significantly increased in the mln of challenged animals these studies may provide further insights into understanding the mucosal immune response to pedv and its role in protection against disease open access citation krishna vd kim y yang m vannucci f molitor t torremorell m et al 2020 immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in swine and protection against subsequent infection plos one 154 e0231723 https//doi rectal swab samples were collected daily using bbl tm cultureswab tm collection and transport system becton dickinson and co sparks md each swab was suspended inimmune response to pedv in swine plos one | https//doi org/10.1371/journal

background the pig faecal virome which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces is complex and consists of pig viruses bacteriophages transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species only little is known about factors influencing its general composition here the effect of the probiotic bacterium enterococcus faecium e faecium ncimb 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets which received either the probiotic bacterium or not results from 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial dna and rna virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled next generation sequencing resulting in 390650 sequence reads in average 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses the percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest 55-77% in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest 8-10% in the samples of the sows in contrast the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows the dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets kobuvirus 54 day-old piglets boca- dependo-and pig stool-associated small circular dna virus and the sows pigscv circovirus and ''circovirus-like'' viruses cb-a and rw-a in addition the shannon index which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets no consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group conclusion the analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium e faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method
astroviruses are small non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that belong to the astroviridae family astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains once thought to be species specific recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown recombination events can lead to drastic evolutionary changes and contribute to cross-species transmission events this work reviews the current state of research on astrovirus evolution and emergence especially as it relates to cross-species transmission and recombination of astroviruses
oropouche caraparu guama guaroa and tacaiuma viruses orthobunyavirus genus cause human febrile illnesses and/or encephalitis to achieve a therapeutical agent to prevent and/or treat these diseases we evaluated the antiviral action of interferon-alpha ifn-␣ on these orthobunyaviruses in vitro results showed that all the studied orthobunyaviruses are susceptible to antiviral action of ifn-␣ but this susceptibility is limited and dependent on both concentration of drug and treatment period in vivo results demonstrated that ifn-␣ present antiviral action on oropouche and guaroa viruses when used as a prophylactic treatment moreover a treatment initiated 3 h after infection prevented the death of guaroa virus infected-mice additionally mortality of mice was related to the migration and replication of viruses in their brains our results suggest that ifn-␣ could be potentially useful in the prevention of diseases caused by oropouche virus and in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases caused by guaroa virus
introduction adjuvants form an integral component in most of the inactivated and subunit vaccine formulations careful and proper selection of adjuvants helps in promoting appropriate immune responses against target pathogens at both innate and adaptive levels such that protective immunity can be elicited areas covered herein we describe the recent progress in our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants that are licensed for use in human vaccines or in clinical or pre-clinical stages at both innate and adaptive levels different pathogens have distinct characteristics which require the host to mount an appropriate immune response against them adjuvants can be selected to elicit a tailor-made immune response to specific pathogens based on their unique properties identification of biomarkers of adjuvanticity for several candidate vaccines using omics-based technologies can unravel the mechanism of action of modern and experimental adjuvants expert opinion adjuvant technology has been revolutionized over the last two decades in-depth understanding of the role of adjuvants in activating the innate immune system combined with systems vaccinology approaches have led to the development of next-generation novel adjuvants that can be used in vaccines against challenging pathogens and in specific target populations article history
knowledge of immunodominant regions in major viral antigens is important for rational design of effective vaccines and diagnostic tests although there have been many reports of such work done for sars-cov these were mainly focused on the immune responses of humans and mice in this study we aim to search for and compare immunodominant regions of the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins which are recognized by sera from different animal species including mouse rat rabbit civet pig and horse twelve overlapping recombinant protein fragments were produced in escherichia coli six each for the s and n proteins which covered the entire coding region of the two proteins using a membrane-strip based western blot approach the reactivity of each antigen fragment against a panel of animal sera was determined immunodominant regions containing linear epitopes which reacted with sera from all the species tested were identified for both proteins the s3 fragment aa 402-622 and the n4 fragment aa 220-336 were the most immunodominant among the six s and n fragments respectively antibodies raised against the s3 fragment were able to block the binding of a panel of s-specific monoclonal antibodies mab to sars-cov in elisa further demonstrating the immunodominance of this region based on these findings one-step competition elisas were established which were able to detect sars-cov antibodies from human and at least seven different animal species considering that a large number of animal species are known to be susceptible to sars-cov these assays will be a useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of sars-cov and to minimise the risk of animal-to-human transmission
in recent years many studies have shown that recombinant adenovirus live vector-based vaccines are a promising novel vaccine candidate against virus infection erefore in this study a new type of recombinant adenovirus expressing the spike s protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv rad-pedv-s was generated and its characteristics were determined en its efficacy as a vaccine candidate was evaluated in 4-week-old pigs e results showed that the s protein could be well expressed at a high level in rad-pedv-s-infected cells and that the viral titers could reach 10 11 pfu/ml further animal experimental results showed that rad-pedv-s elicited a significant pedv-specific humoral immune response after vaccination p < 0.05 in addition rad-pedv-s provided partial protection for pigs against the highly virulent pedv challenge e results presented in this study indicate that the adenovirus vector can be used as a vaccine delivery vector for the development of a pedv vaccine and is a promising novel vaccine candidate for future prevention and control of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped but its efficacy still needs to be improved in the future
the k418 chimeric virus of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv was engineered by replacing the genomic region containing structure protein genes of an infectious clone of prrsv fl12 with the same region obtained from a korean dominant field strain lmy the k418 reached 10 6 tcid 50 /ml of viral titer with similar growth kinetics to those of parental strains and had a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response to field serum from the entire country the chimeric clone pk418 can be used as a practical tool for further studying the molecular characteristics of prrsv proteins through genetic manipulation furthermore successful construction of the k418 will allow for the development of customized vaccine candidates against prrsv which has evolved rapidly in korea
during two years 1217 children hospitalized with gastroenteritis at·the children's centre in winnipeg manitoba canada were studied bacterial pathogens were present in 25% of these children enteropathogenic escherichia coli in 120 shigella in 139 salmonella in 24 and multiple pathogens in 18 rotavirus was detected in 54 ii % of 472 patients examined rotavirus and enteropathogenic e coli were the most common pathogens in infants and shigella was the most common in older children bacterial diarrhea occurred more commonly in summer whereas rotavirus infection occurred more commonly in winter among 276 children screened enterotoxigenic e coli was found in three and aeromonas shigelloides that produced a similar toxin in two others enteroinvasive e coli was not detected in 70 children organisms producing toxins "cytotoxic" to hela cells were isolated from three of 90 children screening for enterotoxigenic or enteroinvasive organisms was not productive of a significant number of pathogens and although screening for rotavirus did improve the number of etiologic diagnoses the etiology of the majority of cases of diarrhea remained unknown despite a decline in the rate of mortality due to gastroenteritis in north america this illness remains a major cause of infant morbidity during the last few years newer techniques such as direct electron microscopic examination of feces and specialized assays for enterotoxigenic or enteroinvasive organisms have become available with use of these techniques it has become apparent that in north america england and australia the rotavirus is a major cause of gastroenteritis in young children . the role of enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive escherichia

baxter has developed a new recombinant factor ix rfix drug product bax326 for treating patients with hemophilia b or congenital fix deficiency an extensive preclinical program evaluated the pharmacokinetics efficacy and safety of bax326 in different species the efficacy of bax326 was tested in three mouse models of primary pharmacodynamics tail-tip bleeding carotid occlusion and thrombelastography the pharmacokinetics was evaluated after a single intravenous bolus injection in mice rats and macaques toxicity was assessed in rats and macaques safety pharmacology in rabbits and macaques and immunogenicity in mice bax326 was shown to be efficacious in all three primary pharmacodynamic studies p b 0.0076 hemostatic efficacy was dose related and similar for the three lots tested pharmacokinetic results showed that rfix activity and rfix antigen concentrations declined in a bi-phasic manner similar to a previously licensed rfix product bax326 was well tolerated in rabbits and macaques at all dose levels no thrombogenic events and no adverse clinical respiratory or cardiovascular effects occurred bax326 was also shown to have a similar immunogenicity profile to the comparator rfix product in mice these results demonstrate that bax326 has a favorable preclinical safety and efficacy profile predictive of a comparable effect to that of the previously licensed rfix in humans
observed among these centers with some centers exhibiting 3-5 times the titers of the others minor to no differences were observed for levels of anti-mev and anti-cmv respectively importantly elevated anti-hav ig titers were broadly observed across plasma units obtained from the centers exhibiting high titers indicative of a potential regional phenomenon among donors as opposed to few donors with singularly high titers plasma from these high-titer centers conferred significantly greater neutralization against hav in vitro the outcomes of this study give a glimpse of the antibody diversity inherent in human plasma used to manufacture ig products
a b s t r a c t rna viruses have been associated with enteritis in poultry and have been isolated from diseased birds the same viral agents have also been detected in healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease in order to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles which do not involve the use of density gradients for generating viral metagenome data in this study the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for rna viruses from the gastrointestinal tract in addition with the use of the best method and increased sequencing depth a glimpse of the rna viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is presented the viruses from the reoviridae and astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified the rarefaction curve at the species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was included with the increased sequencing depth implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a coronavirus that infects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhea and vomiting in older pigs or extreme dehydration and death that could reach 100% mortality in neonatal piglets in the us the first pedv outbreaks occurred in 2013 and since then us pedv strains have quickly spread throughout the us and worldwide causing significant economic and public health concerns currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the us but there is no live attenuated vaccine which is considered the best option in controlling pedv by inducing transferrable mucosal immunity to susceptible neonatal piglets in this study we passaged an us pedv isolate under various conditions to generate three strains and characterized their growth and antigenicity in cell culture using various assays including western blot analysis serum neutralization assay sequencing analysis and confocal microscopy finally these strains were evaluated for pathogenicity in nursing piglets 1-4 days old results one of the pedv strains generated in this study designated as pedv 8aa is able to replicate in cells without any protease and grows to a high titer of >8 log 10 tcid 50 /ml in cell culture interestingly replication of pedv 8aa was severely reduced by trypsin and this correlated with the inhibition of virus attachment and entry into the cells in neonatal nursing piglets pedv 8aa passage number 70 or 105 was found to be fully attenuated with limited virus shedding conclusions these results suggest that applying selective pressure during viral passages can facilitate attainment of viral attenuation and that pedv 8aa warrants further investigation as an attenuated vaccine
storage of stool specimens at -70°c has been reported to destroy the characteristic morphology of calicivirus to determine if other stool-shed viruses are similarly affected stool specimens previously examined by electron microscopy and observed to contain virus particles were reexamined after 6-10 years of storage at -70°c to -85°c the stools contained virus particles of different morphological types including astrovirus small round structured virus adenovirus and rotavirus as well as calicivirus also reexamined were stools containing coronavirus-like particles and t = 19 virus-like particles characteristic virus particles including calicivirus particles were recognized in all the stools reexamined the results indicate that long-term storage of stools at ultralow temperatures does not present a significant problem for the morphological identification of stool-shed viruses address reprint requests to fred p williams jr environmental monitoring systems laboratory usepa 26 west m l king dr cincinnati oh 45268

bovine herpesvirus-1 bhv-1 is a major cause of respiratory tract diseases in cattle vaccination of cattle against bhv-1 is a high priority a major concern of currently modified live bhv-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection and subsequent reactivation resulting in many outbreaks thus there is a need for alternative strategies we generated two recombinant newcastle disease viruses ndvs expressing the glycoprotein d gd of bhv-1 from an added gene one recombinant rlasota/gdfl expressed gd without any modification the other recombinant rlasota/gdf expressed a chimeric gd in which the ectodomain of gd was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the ndv fusion f glycoprotein remarkably the native gd expressed by rlasota/gdfl virus was incorporated into the ndv virion 2.5-fold more efficiently than the native ndv proteins whereas the chimeric gd was not detectably incorporated even though it was abundantly expressed on the infected cell surface the expression of gd did not increase the virulence of the rndv vectors in chickens a single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with either recombinant ndv elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to bhv-1 with the responses to rlasota/gdfl being higher than those to rlasota/gdf following challenge with bhv-1 calves immunized with the recombinant ndvs had lower titers and earlier clearance of challenge virus compared to the empty vector control and reduced disease was observed with rlasota/gdfl following challenge the titers of serum antibodies specific to bhv-1 were higher in the animals immunized with the rndv vaccines compared to the rndv parent virus indicating that the vaccines primed for secondary responses our data suggest that ndv can be used as a vaccine vector in bovines and that bhv-1 gd may be useful in mucosal vaccine against bhv-1 infection but might require augmentation by a second dose or the inclusion of additional bhv-1 antigens
vaccination is one of the most successful immunology applications that has considerably improved human health the dna vaccine is a new vaccine being developed since the early 1990s although the dna vaccine is promising no human dna vaccine has been approved to date the main problem facing dna vaccine efficacy is the lack of a dna vaccine delivery system several studies explored this limitation one of the best dna vaccine delivery systems uses a live bacterial vector as the carrier the live bacterial vector induces a robust immune response due to its natural characteristics that are recognized by the immune system moreover the route of administration used by the live bacterial vector is through the mucosal route that beneficially induces both mucosal and systemic immune responses the mucosal route is not invasive making the vaccine easy to administer increasing the patient's acceptance lactic acid bacterium is one of the most promising bacteria used as a live bacterial vector however some other attenuated pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella spp and shigella spp have been used as dna vaccine carriers numerous studies showed that live bacterial vectors are a promising candidate to deliver dna vaccines
sialodacryoadenitis sda is a naturally-occurring infection of the laboratory rat raused by the coronavirus sialodacryoadenitis virus sdav the study of sdav has been limited because there is no widely available continuous cell line for the propagation of high titers of the virus the purpose of this study therefore was to compare the ability of sdav to replicate in the permanent cell lines lbc of rat origin and the mouse cell lines l-929 and l-2 following 2 to 6 repeated passages of sdav in lbc cells the virus could be readily propagated in lbc and l-2 cells but not in l-929 cells similarly sdav adapted to replicate directly in l-2 cells could be readily propagated in lbc but not l-929 cells in lbc and l-2 cells cytopathic effect cpe viral antigen viral particles and virus infectivity could be demonstrated titers of up to 108 o infectious viral particles/0.25 ml of culture fluid were obtained at 48 hours in l-2 cells titers in lbc cells were one to two logs lower when susceptible rats were inoculated with eighth passage l-2 cell-adapted virus they developed typical lesions of sda virus could be recovered from infected tissues and propagated in l-2 cells on first passage the ability to propagate sdav to high titers in the widely available l-2 cell line should promote the study of this virus and facilitate its comparison with other murine coronaviruses
host antiviral genes are important regulators of antiviral immunity and plausible genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity after vaccination we genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagsnps from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine associations between snps/ haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in caucasians and african-americans genetic variants within the ddx58/rig-i gene including a coding polymorphism rs3205166/ val800val were associated as single-snps p≤0.017 although these snps did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/fdr and in haplotype-level analysis with measles-specific antibody variations in caucasians haplotype allele p-value=0.021 haplotype global p-value=0.076 four ddx58 polymorphisms in high ld demonstrated also associations after correction for fdr with variations in both measles-specific ifn-γ and il-2 secretion in caucasians p≤0.001 q=0.193 two intronic oas1 polymorphisms including the functional oas1 snp rs10774671 p=0.003 demonstrated evidence of association with a significant alleledose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in african-americans genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of adar genetic variants including a nonsynonymous snp rs2229857/arg384lys p=0.01 in regulating measles virus-specific ifn-γ elispot responses in caucasians haplotype global p-value=0.017 after correction fdr 15 single-snp associations 11 snps in caucasians and 4 snps in african-americans still remained significant at the q-value<0.20 in conclusion our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control as critical determinants differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in caucasians and african-americans dcorresponding q-values adjusting for fdr bolded snps are associated with an allele dose-related decrease in il-2 secretion levels only polymorphisms with p≤0.01 and q<0.2 are presented in the table

cryptosporidiosis was first identified as a disease of veterinary rather than human medical importance and infection of farmed animals with different species of cryptosporidium continues to be of veterinary clinical concern this chapter provides insights into cryptosporidium infection in a range of farmed animals -cattle sheep goats pigs cervids camelids rabbits water buffalo and poultry -presenting not only an updated overview of the infection in these animals but also information on clinical disease infection dynamics and zoonotic potential although extensive data have been accrued on for example cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves and calf cryptosporidiosis continues to be a major veterinary concern especially in temperate regions there remains a paucity of data for other farmed animals despite cryptosporidium infection causing while cryptosporidiosis in farmed animals is of veterinary relevance resulting in clinical morbidity mortality and associated production losses the zoonotic nature 150 l j robertson et al 4 cryptosporidiosis in farmed animals 151table 4.2 location age and prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in cattle in some recent studies a location age no of animals/farms or locations prevalence microscopy m elisa e molecular mo or other o molecular identification/ species or genotype % investigated reference australia nsw calves 196/20 herds 74 % mo 18s rrna and gp60/ ng et al 2012 c parvum 59 % c bovis 20 % c ryanae 10 % mixed infections 10 % not identified 1 % brazil 30 days 196/dairy herds 11 % mo 18s rrna and gp60/ meireles et al 2011 c parvum 33 % c bovis 5 % c ryanae 10 % c andersoni 10 % not identified 42 % canada <2 months 752/20 dairy herds 17 % m 18s rrna/ budu-amoako et al 2012a 2-6 months 14 % c parvum 5 % >6 months 15 % c bovis 51 % c ryanae 17 % c andersoni 27 % canada 6 months 739/20 beef herds 18 % m 18s rrna and hsp70/ budu-amoako et al 2012b >6 months 15 % c parvum 24 % c bovis 20 % c ryanae 7 % c andersoni 49 % czech republic 20-60 days 750/24 dairy herds 21 % m 18s rrna rflp/ kváč et al 2011 c parvum 86 % c bovis 2 % c andersoni 13 % 154 l j robertson et al china 0->48 months 2056/14 dairy herds 19 % m 18s rrna/ chen and huang 2012 c parvum 48 % c bovis 16 % c andersoni 29 % c hominis 6 % c serpentis 1 % china 0-8 weeks 801/8 herds 21 % m 18s rrna and gp60/ wang et al 2011b c parvum 31 % c bovis 38 % c ryanae 11 % c andersoni 7 % mixed infections 12 % england and wales 3 months 229 dairy or beef calves/diagnostic lab 45 % m 18s rrna/ featherstone et al 2010a c parvum 91 % c bovis 2 % not identified 7 % england and wales d clustered with c bovis c ryanae previously cryptosporidium deerlike genotype andcryptosporidium deer genotype
arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses present a substantial threat to human and animal health worldwide arboviruses can cause a variety of clinical presentations that range from mild to life threatening symptoms many arboviruses are present in nature through two distinct cycles the urban and sylvatic cycle that are maintained in complex biological cycles in this review we briefly discuss the factors driving the emergence of arboviruses such as the anthropogenic aspects of unrestrained human population growth economic expansion and globalization also the important aspects of viruses and vectors in the occurrence of arboviruses epidemics the focus of this review will be on dengue zika and chikungunya viruses particularly because these viruses are currently causing a negative impact on public health and economic damage around the world
small-animal models have been developed for several filoviridae species however serial adaptation was required to produce lethal infection these adapted viruses have sequence changes in several genes including those that modulate the host immune response nonhuman primate models do not require adaptation of filoviruses here we describe lethal models of disease for bundibugyo sudan and zaire species of ebolavirus in the domestic ferret using wild-type nonadapted viruses pathologic features were consistent with disease in primates of particular importance this is the only known small-animal model developed for bundibugyo and the only uniformly lethal animal model for bundibugyo
background the predominant subtypes of swine influenza a virus siv in korea swine population are h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 the viruses are genetically close to the classical u s h1n1 and triple-reassortant h1n2 and h3n2 viruses respectively comparative pathogenesis caused by korean h1n1 h1n2 and h3n2 siv was evaluated in this study findings the h3n2 infected pigs had severe scores of gross and histopathological lesions at post-inoculation days pid 2 and this then progressively decreased both the h1n1 and h1n2 infected pigs lacked gross lesions at pid 2 but they showed moderate to severe pneumonia on pid 4 7 and 14 the pigs infected with h1n1 had significant scores of gross and histopathological lesions when compared with the other pigs infected with h1n2 h3n2 and mock at pid 14 mean siv antigen-positive scores were rarely detected for pigs infected with h1n2 and h3n2 from pid 7 whereas a significantly increased amount of viral antigens were found in the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium of the h1n1infected pigs at pid 14 conclusions we demonstrated that korean siv subtypes had different pulmonary pathologic patterns the korean h3n2 rapidly induced acute lung lesions such as broncho-interstitial pneumonia while the korean h1n1 showed longer course of infection as compared to other strains
the nucleocapsid n protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of sars and the development of vaccines it was expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion with human glutathione s-transferase hgst and was confirmed by western blotting analysis this recombinant n protein hgst-n was purified and used to measure the sars-cov n-specific antibody in the sera of eight sars patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific antibody response to this purified recombinant n protein was 100% positive in the sars patients' sera while none of the control sera from 30 healthy people gave a positive reaction in the same assay the sars-cov n protein was also expressed in lactococcus lactis in the cytoplasm or secreted into the medium the n-producing strain mg1363/ psecn and the purified hgst-n protein were respectively administered to mice either orally or intranasally results indicated that orally delivered mg1363/psecn induced significant n-specific igg in the sera in conclusion our work provides a novel strategy to produce the sars-cov n protein for serodiagnosis and for l lactis-based mucosal vaccines
this study was conducted to assess the effect of colostrum quality and quantity on cryptosporidium spp calf diarrhoea in an intensive dairy cattle farm in greece faecal samples were collected from 100 dairy calves randomly selected and born during all 4 seasons march 2015 to may 2016 of the year in total 71% of the selected calves were positive for cryptosporidium spp oocysts the statistical analysis revealed influence of colostrum quality on faecal score linear regression showed that the colostrum quantity during the first day of life was negatively associated with the number of cryptosporidium spp oocysts in faeces during multivariable analysis the variables representing the quality of colostrum and the season of the calf's birth were identified as confounders cryptosporidium spp is a common pathogen participating in neonatal calf diarrhoea colostrum management and season influence the number of cryprosporidium spp oocysts and faecal consistency the above findings demonstrate novel risk factors that should be included in the strategic approaches to control cryptosporidiosis in newborn calves
emerging and reemerging infectious diseases as well as cancer pose great global health impacts on the society vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases this is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination dna virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of dna manipulation technologies which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years many hurdles still remain for achieving the full clinical potential of viral-vectored vaccines this chapter will present the evolution of vaccines from "live" or "attenuated" first-generation agents to recombinant dna and viral-vectored vaccines particular emphasis will be given to human adenovirus ad for the 204 a v borovjagin et al 206 a v borovjagin et al 208 a v borovjagin et al
background knowledge about parasitic infections is crucial information for animal health particularly of free-ranging species that might come into contact with livestock and humans we investigated the seroprevalence of three tissue-cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites toxoplasma gondii neospora caninum and besnoitia besnoiti in 506 individuals of 12 wildlife species in namibia using in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays indirect elisas applying purified antigens for screening and immunoblots as confirmatory tests we included six species of the suborder feliformia four species of the suborder caniformia and two species of the suborder ruminantia for the two species for which we had most samples and life-history information i e cheetahs acinonyx jubatus n = 250 and leopards panthera pardus n = 58 we investigated t gondii seroprevalence in relation to age class sex sociality solitary mother-offspring group independent sibling group coalition group and site natural habitat vs farmland results all but one carnivore species bat-eared fox otocyon megalotis n = 4 were seropositive to t gondii with a seroprevalence ranging from 52.4% 131/250 in cheetahs to 93.2% 55/59 in african lions panthera leo we also detected antibodies to t gondii in 10.0% 2/20 of blue wildebeest connochaetes taurinus adult cheetahs and leopards were more likely to be seropositive to t gondii than subadult conspecifics whereas seroprevalence did not vary with sex sociality and site furthermore we measured antibodies to n caninum in 15.4% 2/13 of brown hyenas hyaena brunnea and 2.6% 1/39 of black-backed jackals canis mesomelas antibodies to b besnoiti were detected in 3.4% 2/59 of african lions and 20.0% 4/20 of blue wildebeest our results demonstrate that namibian wildlife species were exposed to apicomplexan parasites at different prevalences depending on parasite and host species in addition to serological work molecular work is also needed to better understand the sylvatic cycle and the clear role of wildlife in the epidemiology of these parasites in southern africa
background little is known about the development of cross-reactive antibodies following natural exposure to pathogens such knowledge is critical in the development of new universal influenza vaccines methods to study the possibility of the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to influenza viruses which underwent a major antigenic drift between the years 1999 and 2007 sera from samples of 80 children and 400 adults were selected at random from the israeli national serum bank the sera was obtained in 2002 and in 2007 two time points that followed a major drift in the infectious h3n2 influenza virus strain a/panama/2007/99 to a/wisconsin/ 67/2005 results in the summer of 2002 13% of the children had hemagglutination inhibition hi antibody titers of at least 40 and these antibodies recognized both a/panama/2007/99 and a/wisconsin/67/2005 where the latter strain only began to circulate in israel in 2006 in 2007 29% of the children had hi antibody titers of at least 40 directed against both a/wisconsin/67/2005 and a/panama/2007/99 even though they had never been exposed to the latter virus anti-a/panama/2007/99 antibodies were detected in 58% and 68% of the 2002 and 2007 adult samples respectively while 8% and 39% had antibodies against a/wisconsin/67/2005 respectively the presence of naturally occurring cross-reactive influenza virus antibodies in a significant percentage of children has important implications for the development of a universal influenza vaccine
the safety and the efficacy of a modified-live ml canine coronavirus ccov vaccine strain 257/98-3c was evaluated in 14 dogs seronegative and virus negative for ccov for the safety test four dogs were inoculated two by intramuscular and two by oronasal route with 10 times the vaccinal dose during the observation period 28 days all dogs did not display any local or systemic reaction for the efficacy test eight dogs were vaccinated by intramuscular four dogs-group a or by oronasal route four dogs-group b two dogs were maintained as non-vaccinated controls in the dogs of group a vaccinal virus was not detected in faecal samples by virus isolation vi and by pcr assay while in the dogs of group b the virus was revealed for six median days only by pcr twenty-eight days later the vaccinated and control dogs were challenged with a field ccov strain after the challenge the vaccinated dogs did not display clinical signs and the dogs of group a shed virus for 5.5 median days evaluated by vi and for 10 median days evaluated by pcr virus shedding was not observed both by vi and pcr assay in the dogs of group b the two control dogs displayed moderate clinical signs and the virus was detected by vi for 14.5 median days starting from day 3 post-challenge dpc 3 and by pcr assay for 23 median days starting from dpc 1

porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv is an emerging and re-emerging epizootic virus of swine that causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in china and other countries the variations in the virus and its co-infections with other enteric viruses have contributed to the poor control of pedv infection in the current study a broad epidemiological investigation of pedv was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of china during 2015-2018 the enteric viruses causing co-infection with pedv and the genetic diversity of the pedv s1 gene were also analysed the results indicated that of the 543 diarrhoea samples 66.85% 363/543 were positive for pedv and co-infection rates of pedv with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% 13/363 to 81.55% 296/363 among these enteric viruses the signs of diarrhoea induced by pedv were potentially associated with co-infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 pev and torque teno sus virus 2 ttsuv-2 p < .05 the 147 pedv strains identified in our study belong to chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity the virulence-determining s1 proteins of pedv pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations in which s58_s58insqgvn-n135dup-d158_i159del-like mutations were common patterns 97.28% 143/147 when compared with 2011-2014 pedv strains the amino acid mutations of pedv pandemic strains were mainly located in the n-terminal domain of s1 s1-ntd and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018 furthermore protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the s1 protein of pedv pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the s1 protein these data provide a better understanding of the coinfection and genetic evolution of pedv in china co-infection mutation pedv s1 gene
gs-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that showed therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of ebola virus infection it has been administered under compassionate use to two ebola patients both of whom survived and is currently in phase 2 clinical development for treatment of ebola virus disease here we report the antiviral activities of gs-5734 and the parent nucleoside analog across multiple virus families providing evidence to support new indications for this compound against human viruses of significant public health concern
background-the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus is a member of the coronaviridae cov family that first appeared in the guangdong province of china in 2002 and was recognized as an emerging infectious disease in march 2003 over 8000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic we report the safety and immunogenicity of a sars dna vaccine in a phase i human study methods-a single-plasmid dna vaccine encoding the spike s glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining ics elispot elisa and neutralization assays the vaccine was well-tolerated sars-cov-specific antibody was detected by elisa in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine sars-cov-specific cd4+ t cell responses were detected in all vaccinees and cd8+ t cell responses in ∼20% of individuals conclusions-the vrc sars dna vaccine was well tolerated and produced cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody in healthy adults
the pathogenicity for mice of nine strains of mouse hepatitis virus was studied in mice free from the virus by the intracerebral intraperitoneal intravenous and intranasal routes of inoculation
foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in livestock in large parts of africa and asia where it is an important driver of food insecurity and a major obstacle to agricultural development and the international trade in animal products virtually all commercially available vaccines are inactivated whole-virus vaccines produced in cell culture but the adaptation of a field isolate of the virus to growth in culture is laborious and time-consuming this is of particular concern for the development of vaccines to newly emerging virus lineages where long lead times from virus isolate to vaccine can delay the implementation of effective control programs high antigen yields in production cells are also necessary to make vaccines affordable for less developed countries in endemic areas therefore a rational approach to cell culture adaptation that combines prior knowledge of common adaptive mutations and reverse genetics techniques is urgently required this review provides an overview of amino acid exchanges in the viral capsid proteins in the context of adaptation to cell culture
about 60% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin their increasing number requires the development of new methods for early detection and monitoring of infectious agents in wildlife here we investigated whether blood meals from hematophagous flies could be used to identify the infectious agents circulating in wild vertebrates to this aim 1230 blood-engorged flies were caught in the forests of gabon identified blood meals 30% were from 20 vertebrate species including mammals birds and reptiles among them 9% were infected by different extant malaria parasites among which some belonged to known parasite species others to new parasite species or to parasite lineages for which only the vector was known this study demonstrates that using hematophagous flies as 'flying syringes' constitutes an interesting approach to investigate blood-borne pathogen diversity in wild vertebrates and could be used as an early detection tool of zoonotic pathogens
introduction influenza virus human respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv are important human respiratory pathogens recombinant virus-like particle vlp vaccines are suggested to be potential promising platforms to protect against these respiratory viruses this review updates important progress in the development of vlp vaccines against respiratory viruses areas covered this review summarizes progress in developing vlp and nanoparticle-based vaccines against influenza virus rsv and hmpv the pubmed was mainly used to search for important research articles published since 2010 although earlier key articles were also referenced the research area covered includes vlp and nanoparticle platform vaccines against seasonal pandemic and avian influenza viruses as well as rsv and hmpv respiratory viruses the production methods immunogenic properties and vaccine efficacy of respiratory vlp vaccines in preclinical animal models and clinical studies were reviewed in this article expert opinion previous and current preclinical and clinical studies suggest that recombinant vlp and nanoparticle vaccines are expected to be developed as promising alternative platforms against respiratory viruses in future therefore continued research efforts are warranted article history
the spike s protein of the infectious bronchitis virus ibv plays a central role in the pathogenicity the immune antibody production serotype and the tissue tropism in this study we generate 11 monoclonal antibodies mabs against s1 subunit of ibv sczy3 strain and two mabs 1d5 and 6a12 were positive in indirect elisa against both his-s1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen mab 6a12 and 1d5 could recognized by other 10 ibv strains ibvs from five different genotypes except that 1d5 had a relatively low reaction with two of the 10 tested ibvs end-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney cek cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 6a12 and 1d5 against sczy3 reached 144.7 and 140.6 respectively after screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning we identified two linear b-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mabs 1d5 and 6a12 which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 87 ppqgmaw 93 and 412 iqtrtep 418 respectively in the ibv s1 subunit sequences comparison revealed that epitope 412 iqtrtep 418 was conserved among ibvs while the epitope 87 ppqgmaw 93 was relatively variable among ibvs the novel mabs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for ibv infections
in recent years there has been a significant increase in detection of enterovirus d-68 ev-d68 among patients with severe respiratory infections worldwide ev-d68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen however due to lack of a permissive animal model for ev-d68 a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against ev-d68 has been hampered recently it was shown that ev-d68 has a strong affinity for α26-linked sialic acids sas and we have shown previously that α26-linked sas are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats sigmodon hispidus thus we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for ev-d68 infection here we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated ev-d68 strains vanbt/1 and mo/ 14/49 along with the historical prototype fermon strain atcc to infect cotton rats we found that cotton rats are permissive to ev-d68 infection without virus adaptation the different strains of ev-d68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody na upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization infection with the vanbt/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology intramuscular immunization with live vanbt/1 or mo/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses but a moderate heterologous na response we showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of na against vanbt/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy vanbt/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from vanbt/1 challenge but induced strong pulmonary th1 and th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization in conclusion our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis immune response anti-viral therapies and vaccines against ev-d68 infection
debouck p pensaert m and coussement w 1981 the pathogenesis of an enteric infection in pigs experimentally induced by the coronavirus-like agent cv 777 vet microbiol 6 157--165 sixteen 2--3-days-old caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were each dosed oro-nasally with 2 ml of a bacteria-free filtrate containing 104 pig-infectious-doses of cv 777 the piglets were killed at intervals of 12 to 120 h after infection the coronavirus-like agent caused a local infection of the intestinal tract which resulted in villous atrophy malabsorption and diarrhea the pathogenesis of this infection was similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis tge a known coronaviral infection of pigs however there were some differences by immunofluorescent staining cv 777 antigens were not only detected in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi but also in the cells of the colonic surface epithelium occasional fluorescence was also seen in the small intestinal crypt epithelium but the regenerative capacity of the crypts was not affected the progress of intestinal epithelial cell infection by cv 777 was much slower than that in tge resulting in a longer incubation period and in less drastic epithelial cell destruction the infection of regenerating cells occurred to a much higher degree during the late stage of a cv 777 infection than has been observed in tge.0378-1135/81/0000--0000/$02.50
in many countries vaccines are used for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease fmd however because there is no protection against fmd immediately after vaccination research and development on antiviral agents is being conducted to induce protection until immunological competence is produced this study tested whether well-known chemicals used as rna virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on fmd viruses fmdvs and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against fmdv in vitro/in vivo in addition it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine finally pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion based on these results it is expected that this combined approach could be a therapeutic and preventive treatment for early protection against fmd
parainfluenza virus 5 piv5 known as canine parainfluenza virus in the veterinary field is a negative-sense nonsegmented single-stranded rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family parainfluenza virus 5 is an excellent viral vector and has been used as a live vaccine for kennel cough for many years in dogs without any safety concern it can grow to high titers in many cell types and its genome is stable even in the presence of foreign gene insertions so far piv5 has been used to develop vaccines against influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rabies virus and mycobacterium tuberculosis demonstrating its ability to elicit robust and protective immune responses in preclinical animal models parainfluenza virus 5-based vaccines can be administered intranasally intramuscularly or orally interestingly prior exposure of piv5 does not prevent a piv5-vectored vaccine from generating robust immunity indicating that the vector can be used more than once here these encouraging results are reviewed together along with discussion of the desirable advantages of the piv5 vaccine vector to aid future vaccine design and to accelerate progression of piv5-based vaccines into clinical trials animal infectious disease human infectious disease parainfluenza virus 5 vaccine vector
administration of influenza vaccines via the respiratory tract has potential benefits over conventional parenteral administration inducing immunity directly at the site of influenza exposure as well as being needle free in this study we investigated the suitability of advax™ a stable particulate polymorph of inulin also referred to as delta inulin as a mucosal adjuvant for whole inactivated influenza vaccine wiv administered either as a liquid or dry powder formulation spray freeze-drying produced advax-adjuvanted wiv powder particles in a size range 1-5 μm suitable for inhalation the physical and biological characteristics of both wiv and advax remained unaltered both by admixing wiv with advax and by spray freeze drying upon intranasal or pulmonary immunization both liquid and dry powder formulations containing advax induced significantly higher systemic mucosal and cellular immune responses than non-adjuvanted wiv formulations furthermore pulmonary immunization with advax-adjuvanted wiv led to robust memory b cell responses along with an increase of lung localization factors i e cxcr3 cd69 and cd103 a less pronounced but still positive effect of advax was seen on memory t cell responses in contrast to animals immunized with wiv alone all animals pulmonary immunized with a single dose of advax-adjuvanted wiv were fully protected with no visible clinical symptoms against a lethal dose of influenza virus these data confirm that advax is a potent mucosal adjuvant that boosts vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses both in the lung and systemically with major positive effects on b-cell memory and complete protection against live virus hence respiratory tract immunization particularly via the lungs with advax-adjuvanted wiv formulation as a liquid or dry powder is a promising alternative to parenteral influenza vaccination
background in china large-scale outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by viruses have occurred in pigs since late 2010 to investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in southern china during 2012-2018 were tested results porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples and 96.43% 162/168 in premises respectively porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples and 70.24% 118/168 in premises respectively both transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine rotavirus porv were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises in this study we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov in diarrheal samples of piglets from fujian province in southern china and the prevalence rate of sads-cov was 10.29% 7/68 co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common the most frequent co-infection was pedv with pdcov with an average detection rate of 12.72% 380/2987 ranging from 8.26-17.33%. phylogenetic analysis revealed that pedvs circulating in southern china during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of pedv in genotype iia the most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent coe and epitope regions of the spike gene of the pedvs currently circulating in the field genetic relationships of pdcovs were closely related with chinese strains other than those present in the usa south korea thailand and lao's public conclusions the findings of this study indicated that variant pedv pdcov and sads-cov were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric covs were common in pigs in southern china during 2012-2018 thus significant attention should be paid in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea
sars-cov was the cause of the global pandemic in 2003 that infected over 8000 people in 8 months vaccines against sars are still not available we developed a novel method to produce high levels of a recombinant sars virus-like particles vlps vaccine containing the sars spike s protein and the influenza m1 protein using the baculovirus insect cell expression system these chimeric sars vlps have a similar size and morphology to the wild type sars-cov we tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified chimeric sars vlps and full length sars s protein vaccines in a mouse lethal challenge model the sars vlp vaccine containing 0.8 μg of sars s protein completely protected mice from death when administered intramuscular im or intranasal in routes in the absence of an adjuvant likewise the sars vlp vaccine containing 4 μg of s protein without adjuvant reduced lung virus titer to below detectable level protected mice from weight loss and elicited a high level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov sf9 cell-produced full length purified sars s protein was also an effective vaccine against sars-cov but only when co-administered im with aluminum hydroxide sars-cov vlps are highly immunogenic and induce neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge sf9 cell-based vlp vaccines are a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic agents

many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans e g aids and ebola are zoonotic having shifted from wildlife populations critical questions for predicting disease emergence are 1 what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another and 2 which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift in wild primates infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region therefore humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes which include chimpanzees and gorillas because these species represent our closest relatives geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen we extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate ''hotspot'' maps highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest we find that central africa and amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates due to a high diversity of closely related primate species hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west africa where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives these areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations close proximity to apes and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals
the ®eld isolate of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was serially passaged in vero cells the cell passaged pedv designated kpedv-9 was tested for its pathogenicity in the neonatal pigs immunogenicity and safety in the pregnant sows the result indicated that kpedv-9 at the 93rd passage revealed reduced pathogenicity in the neonatal pigs pregnant sows inoculated with the attenuated virus showed increased immune responses by elisa in addition delivered piglets were protected from challenge of wild type pedv the safety test in pregnant sows indicated that all inoculated animals farrowed the average numbers of litters of piglets the results of this study supported that the attenuated virus derived from serial passage could be applied as vaccine for protecting suckling piglets against pedv infection #
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov are enteropathogenic coronaviruses covs of swine tgev appearance in 1946 preceded identification of pedv 1971 and pdcov 2009 that are considered as emerging covs a spike deletion mutant of tgev associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv prcv is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical since prcv emergence and rapid spread most pigs have become immune to both prcv and tgev which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of tgev in contrast pdcov and pedv are currently expanding their geographic distribution and there are reports on the circulation of tgev-pedv recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses tgev pedv and pdcov cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs most severe in neonatal piglets and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration which can lead to the death of piglets strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge however these viruses display no cross-protection adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated covs recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field
nipah virus niv is a new zoonotic paramyxovirus that emerged in 1998 and is now classified in the genus henipavirus along with the closely related hendra virus hev niv is highly pathogenic in several vertebrate species including humans and the lack of available vaccines or specific treatment restricts it to biosafety level 4 bsl4 containment a serum neutralization test was developed for measuring niv neutralizing antibodies under bsl2 conditions using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv expressing green fluorescent protein gfp and bearing the f and g proteins of niv vsv-niv-gfp the neutralization titers were obtained by counting gfp-expressing cells or by measuring fluorescence the performance of this new assay was compared against the conventional test using live niv with panels of sera from several mammalian species including sera from niv outbreaks experimental infections as well as hev-specific sera the results obtained with the vsv-niv-gfp based test correlated with those obtained using live niv using a 50% reduction in vsv-niv-gfp infected cells as the cut-off for neutralization this new assay demonstrated its potential as an effective tool for detecting niv neutralizing antibodies under bsl2 containment with greater speed sensitivity and safety as compared to the conventional niv serum neutralization test
appropriate adjuvant selection may be essential to optimize the potency and to tailor the immune response of subunit vaccines to induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus rsv-a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccinewe previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric rsv f pre-f "ds-cav1" immunogen which induced high titer rsv-neutralizing antibodies in mice and non-human primates when formulated with adjuvants poly ic and poly iclc respectively to assess the impact of different adjuvants here we formulated rsv f ds-cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses very high rsv-neutralizing antibody responses 19006 ec 50 were observed in naïve mice immunized with 2 doses of ds-cav1 adjuvanted with sigma adjuvant system sas an oil-in-water adjuvant plus carbopol high responses 3658-7108 were observed with ds-cav1 adjuvanted with alum sas alone adjuplex poly ic and poly iclc and moderate responses 1251-2129 were observed with ds-cav1 adjuvanted with the tlr4 agonist mpla alum plus mpla or addavax in contrast ds-cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses 6 a balanced igg1 and igg2a th2/th1 immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups all but alum and adjuplex we also tested the immune response induced by ds-cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing ds-cav1 immunity we observed that ds-cav1 adjuvanted with sas plus carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold whereas ds-cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold finally we tested whether a mixture of isa 71 vg and carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in ds-cav1 immunized calves while pre-f-stabilized bovine rsv f induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with sas plus carbopol the addition of carbopol to isa 71 vg did not enhance immune responses in calves the vaccine response to pre-f-stabilized rsv f is augmented by adjuvant but the plos one | https//doi

classical swine fever csf causes major losses in pig farming with various degrees of disease severity efficient live attenuated vaccines against classical swine fever virus csfv are used routinely in endemic countries however despite intensive vaccination programs in these areas for more than 20 years csf has not been eradicated molecular epidemiology studies in these regions suggests that the virus circulating in the field has evolved under the positive selection pressure exerted by the immune response to the vaccine leading to new attenuated viral variants recent work by our group demonstrated that a high proportion of persistently infected piglets can be generated by early postnatal infection with low and moderately virulent csfv strains here we studied the immune response to a hog cholera lapinised virus vaccine hclv c-strain in six-week-old persistently infected pigs following post-natal infection csfv-negative pigs were vaccinated as controls the humoral and interferon gamma responses as well as the csfv rna loads were monitored for 21 days post-vaccination no vaccine viral rna was detected in the serum samples and tonsils from csfv postnatally persistently infected pigs for 21 days post-vaccination furthermore no e2-specific antibody response or neutralising antibody titres were shown in csfv persistently infected vaccinated animals likewise no of ifn-gamma producing cell response against csfv or pha was observed to our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating the absence of a response to vaccination in csfv persistently infected pigs
the unique ability of bats to act as reservoir for viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans suggests unique properties and functional characteristics of their immune system however the lack of bat specific reagents in particular antibodies has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity using crossreactive antibodies we report the phenotypic and functional characterization of t cell subsets b and nk cells in the fruit-eating bat pteropus alecto our findings indicate the predominance of cd8 + t cells in the spleen from wild-caught bats that may reflect either the presence of viruses in this organ or predominance of this cell subset at steady state instead majority of t cells in circulation lymph nodes and bone marrow bm were cd4 + subsets interestingly 40% of spleen t cells expressed constitutively il-17 il-22 and tgf-β mrna which may indicate a strong bias towards the th17 and regulatory t cell subsets furthermore the unexpected high number of t cells in bats bm could suggest an important role in t cell development finally mitogenic stimulation induced proliferation and production of effector molecules by bats immune cells this work contributes to a better understanding of bat's immunity opening up new perspectives of therapeutic interventions for humans in recent years bats have been recognized as important reservoirs of highly pathogenic viruses for human and other animals such as sars coronavirus hendra and nipah viruses 12 . bats have also been proposed as potential reservoir for ebola 3 and mers 4 although direct evidence is still lacking how do bats cope with viruses that have a high mortality rate in humans without getting sick how have they evolved to co-exist with such viruses understanding the bats immune system should help address this question and might open a door to new therapeutic interventions for humans immunity in mammals comprises two main arms namely the innate and the adaptive immunity that interact with each other to generate optimal responses against pathogens the innate immunity provides immediate nonspecific host defenses and is highly conserved among species whereas the adaptive immunity is restricted to higher organisms and involves antigen-specific t and b cells 5 . pathogen-derived antigens are presented by antigen presenting cells apc such as macrophages and dendritic cells dc to antigen-specific t and b cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes spleen and various mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues malt 6 . the antigen-specific t or b cells get then activated proliferate and migrate to the site of infection where they fight the invading pathogen through antibody production and/or direct killing of the infected cells the effector t lymphocyte population can be broadly divided into two subsets namely t helper cells th and cytotoxic t cells ctl which are identified by the expression of cd4 and cd8 molecules on their surface respectively 7 . upon activation cd4 + th cells produce cytokines which are essential to help recruit and further activate/differentiate other immune cell types 8 . for example cd4 + th are critical for b cell differentiation into
the goal of this study was to develop a quantitative detection system for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov targeting the nucleocapsid protein np to determine the presence and degree of infection in suspected individuals because the np is the viral protein shed during infection and its template mrna is the most abundant subgenomic rna it is a suitable candidate for developing antibodies for diagnostic applications in this study we have prepared full-length sars-cov np expressed in escherichia coli and purified full-length np was used for the preparation of mouse monoclonal antibody and chicken polyclonal igy antibodies for the development of heterosandwich elisa for early diag-nostics of sars-suspected individuals the sensitivity of the developed heterosandwich elisa can detect the viral antigen at 18.5 pg/ml of recombinant np this study describes ultrasensitive elisa using 19b6 monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody and igy as the detecting antibody against the most abundant sars-cov np antigens one of the most important findings was the use of inexpensive polyclonal igy antibody to increase the sensitivity of the detection system for sars-cov at the picogram level furthermore the immunoassay of sars-cov np antigen developed could be an effective and sensitive method of diagnosing sars-suspected individuals during a future sars-cov outbreak
two hundred and fifteen diarrheic samples from 1 to 7 days old piglets were tested for a panel of enteric pathogens in 19 of the studied farms additional fecal samples from apparently healthy pen-mates were collected and tested for the same panel of infectious agents samples were bacteriologically cultured and tested by pcr for e coli virulence factors genes c perfringens types a and c toxins cpα cpβ cpβ2 and c difficile toxins tcda tcdb moreover rotavirus a rva rotavirus b rvb rotavirus c rvc porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev were also determined by rt-qpcr more than one pathogen could be detected in all of the outbreaks nevertheless rva was the only agent that could be statistically correlated with the outcome of diarrhea for the other viruses and bacteria analyzed significant differences between the diseased pigs and the controls were not found in spite of this the individual analysis of each of the studied farms indicated that other agents such as rvb rvc toxigenic c difficile or pathogenic e coli could play a relevant role in the outbreak of diarrhea in conclusion the large diversity of agent combinations and disease situations detected in neonatal diarrhea outbreaks of this study stand for a more personalized diagnosis and management advice at a farm level

multiple viruses with zoonotic potential have been isolated from bats globally here we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel paramyxovirus alston virus alspv isolated from urine collected from an australian pteropid bat colony in alstonville new south wales characterization of alspv by whole-genome sequencing and analyzing antigenic relatedness revealed it is a rubulavirus that is closely related to parainfluenza virus 5 piv5 intranasal exposure of mice to alspv resulted in no clinical signs of disease although viral rna was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection viral shedding in respiratory secretions and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain these results imply that alspv may be similar to piv5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species this isolation of a novel paramyxovirus with the potential to transmit from bats to other mammalian species reinforces the importance of continued surveillance of bats as a source of emerging viruses
pearl river delta prd clades molecular clock analysis indicated that they emerged several months before the hp human strains collectively our results suggest that iavh7n9 viruses evolve in chickens through antigenic drift to include a signature hp sequence in the ha gene which highlights challenges in risk assessment and public health management of iavh7n9 infections at the human-animal interface
infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly alternative treatments should be investigated we produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with ebov virus-like particles and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection balb/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal at 30 minutes 1 or 2 days post-infection dpi in which all animals survived to decrease the possibility of serum sickness the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate fab′ 2 fragments with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization other fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or fab′ 2 at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from ebov infection these results justify future efficacy studies for purified equine products in nhps ebola virus ebov is a pathogen from the filoviridae family and is capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates past outbreaks of ebov disease evd were sporadic unpredictable and localized to remote regions of central africa with the death toll reaching up to 90% 1 . ebov is one of the most lethal viruses known to humans and a licensed prophylactic or therapeutic still remains unavailable in a clinical setting there is currently little that can be done for infected patients outside of supportive care which includes fluid replenishment administration of antivirals and management of secondary symptoms 23 . the combination
pathogens that spill over between species cause a significant human and animal health burden here we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover we assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife and 84% included mammals further 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts rather than a single species for persistence among mammals the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents artiodactyls and carnivores the distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential we found birds primates and bats to be overrepresented we also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival thus we find that in many respects reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special the described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases

arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes arenaviruses package a large l and small s genome segment in their virions for segmented rna viruses like these novel genotypes can be generated through mutation recombination and reassortment although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections here we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes from 48 infected animals we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 l and 11 s genotypes the majority of snakes were multiply infected with up to 4 distinct s and 11 distinct l segment genotypes in individual animals this s/l imbalance was typical in all cases intrahost l segment genotypes outnumbered s genotypes and a particular s segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level we corroborated sequencing results by qrt-pcr and virus isolation and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected including recombinant segments with unusual organizations plos pathogens |
viruslike particles grouped in clusters not bound by a membrane were seen in electron micrographs of fresh leucoblasts of an acute leukemic patient they consisted of large 100-nm diameter round particles apparently composed of subunits tubular structures 30-50-nm diameter were also seen in leucoblasts of the same patient the two types of structures were never seen simultaneously in the same cell the authors review the literature pertaining to the morphology of virus-like particles associated with malignant hematologic disease
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a highly pathogenic and zoonotic virus with a fatality rate in humans of over 35%. although several vaccine candidates have been developed there is still no clinically available vaccine for mers-cov in this study we developed two types of mers-cov vaccines a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the mers-cov spike gene ad5/ mers and spike protein nanoparticles formulated with aluminum alum adjuvant next we tested a heterologous prime-boost vaccine strategy which compared priming with ad5/mers and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles and vice versa with homologous prime-boost vaccination comprising priming and boosting with either spike protein nanoparticles or ad5/mers although both types of vaccine could induce specific immunoglobulin g against mers-cov neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov were induced only by heterologous prime-boost immunization and homologous immunization with spike protein nanoparticles interestingly th1 cell activation was induced by immunization schedules including ad5/mers but not by those including only spike protein nanoparticles heterologous primeboost vaccination regimens including ad5/mers elicited simultaneous th1 and th2 responses but homologous prime-boost regimens did not thus heterologous prime-boost may induce longer-lasting immune responses against mers-cov because of an appropriate balance of th1/th2 responses however both heterologous prime-boost and homologous spike protein nanoparticles vaccinations could provide protection from mers-cov challenge in mice our results demonstrate that heterologous immunization by priming with ad5/mers and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles could be an efficient prophylactic strategy against mers-cov infection
avian influenza viruses sporadically cross the species barrier to mammals including humans in which they may cause epidemic disease recently such an epidemic occurred due to the emergence of avian influenza virus of the subtype h10n7 seal/h10n7 in harbor seals phoca vitulina this epidemic caused high mortality in seals along the north-west coast of europe and represented a potential risk for human health to characterize the spectrum of lesions and to identify the target cells and viral distribution findings in 16 harbor seals spontaneously infected with seal/h10n7 are described the seals had respiratory tract inflammation extending from the nasal cavity to bronchi associated with intralesional virus antigen in respiratory epithelial cells virus infection was restricted to the respiratory tract the fatal outcome of the viral infection in seals was most likely caused by secondary bacterial infections to investigate the pathogenic potential of h10n7 infection for humans we inoculated the seal virus intratracheally into six ferrets and performed pathological and virological analyses at 3 and 7 days post inoculation these experimentally inoculated ferrets displayed mild clinical signs virus excretion from the pharynx and respiratory tract inflammation extending from bronchi to alveoli that was associated with virus antigen expression exclusively in the respiratory epithelium virus was isolated only from the respiratory tract in conclusion seal/h10n7 infection in naturally infected harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets shows that respiratory epithelial cells are the permissive cells for viral replication fatal outcome in seals was caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia similar to that in fatal human cases during influenza pandemics productive infection of ferrets indicates that seal/h10n7 may possess a zoonotic potential this outbreak of plos one |
streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus s zooepidemicus has caused several outbreaks of haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs in recent years this highly contagious and often fatal disease is characterised by sudden onset of clinical signs including pyrexia dyspnoea and haemorrhagic nasal discharge post mortem examination typically reveals pulmonary haemorrhage and pleural effusion histopathology demonstrates fibrino-suppurative necrotising and haemorrhagic pneumonia in most cases the pathogenesis of s zooepidemicus infection in dogs is incompletely understood bacterial virulence factors as well as host factors may contribute to the severe outcome s zooepidemicus occasionally causes zoonotic infections with potentially serious consequences canine vaccines for s zooepidemicus are currently not available and prevention of the disease therefore relies on limiting bacterial spread by implementing stringent control measures in kennels further research particularly sequence analysis of canine strains is required to gain insights into epidemiology and pathogenesis of this emerging disease
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an economically important enteric coronavirus with over a 90% mortality rate in neonatal piglets the virus emerged in the us in 2013 resulting in severe production losses effective vaccine development against pedv is a challenge inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy attenuated vaccines while more effective require a relatively long lead development time are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks to combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated pedv vaccines respectively in this study we tested the hypothesis that subjecting pedv virions to heat treatment at 44 • c for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins followed by exposure to rnase to fragment the genome would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities we expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model following the heat and rnase treatment pedv virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in vero cells indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro strong pedv spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets upon challenge all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology while the unvaccinated controls were not the vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge nor did they develop intestinal lesions thus the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for pedv immunization
faecal samples from suckling n 205 and weaned piglets n 82 with diarrhoea from 24 farms in southern germany were examined for shedding of important metazoic parasitic viral and bacterial pathogens using culture microscopic and electronmicroscopic methods escherichia coli isolates were tested further for the enterotoxin genes est-ia and elt-i by colony blot hybridization isospora suis was diagnosed in 26.9 % and cryptosporidium parvum in 1.4 % of the piglets investigated the proportion of coronavirus-positive animals was 13.4 % and 4 % were positive for rotavirus it was found that 17.6 % of the animals were infected with enterotoxigenic e coli etec 10.1 % etec-st-ia and 8.6 % etec-lt-i respectively the occurrence of the pathogens was signi®cantly associated with the age of the animals examined p < 0.001 isospora suis was predominantly isolated from suckling piglets in the second and third week of life while in weaned piglets fourth week of life rotavirus and etec were most prevalent on 22 of the 24 piglet production farms examined at least one of the investigated pathogens was detected coronavirus was diagnosed in 66.7 % i suis in 62.5 % rotavirus in 20.8 % and c parvum in 8.3 % of the farms these results underline the fact that despite the hygienic technical and immune preventive efforts during the last years enteropathogens are still common in german piglet production units
multiple sclerosis ms is a chronic disease of the cns that typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood it is highly variable in its expression and severity the cause of ms is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis it is known that viruses can induce chronic neurological disease but the pathogenetic process in unclear a viral cause for ms has been postulated but to date no single virus has been confirmed to be associated with the disease although most viral candidates are no longer considered as possible aetiological agents in ms a few are still being investigated
the immunogenicity and the efficacy of a beta-propiolactone-inactivated caprine herpesvirus 1 cphv-1 vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 tm were tested in goats following two subcutaneous immunizations goats developed high titers of cphv-1-specific serum and vaginal igg and high serum virus neutralization vn titers peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc stimulated in vitro with inactivated cphv-1 produced high levels of soluble ifn-gamma and exhibited high frequencies of ifn-gamma producing cells while soluble il-4 was undetectable on the other hand control goats receiving the inactivated cphv-1 vaccine without adjuvant produced only low serum antibody responses a vaginal challenge with virulent cphv-1 was performed in all vaccinated goats and in naïve goats to assess the efficacy of the two vaccines vaginal disease was not detected in goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm and these animals had undetectable levels of infectious challenge virus in their vaginal washes goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 in the absence of adjuvant exhibited a less severe disease when compared to naïve goats but shed titers of challenge virus that were similar to those of naïve goats detection and quantitation of latent cphv-1 dna in sacral ganglia in challenged goats revealed that the inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm vaccine was able to significantly reduce the latent viral load when compared either to the naïve goats or to the goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 in the absence of adjuvant thus a vaccine composed of inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm as adjuvant was strongly immunogenic and induced effective immunity against vaginal cphv-1 infection in goats
we have shown previously that replacement of the spike s gene of the apathogenic ibv strain beau-r with that from the pathogenic strain of the same serotype m41 resulted in an apathogenic virus beaur-m41s that conferred protection against challenge with m41 . we have constructed a recombinant ibv beaur-4/91s with the genetic backbone of beau-r but expressing the spike protein of the pathogenic ibv strain 4/91uk which belongs to a different serogroup as beaudette or m41 similar to our previous findings with beaur-m41s clinical signs observations showed that the s gene of the pathogenic 4/91 virus did not confer pathogenicity to the ribv beaur-4/91s furthermore protection studies showed there was homologous protection beaur-4/91s conferred protection against challenge with wild type 4/91 virus as shown by the absence of clinical signs ibv rna assessed by qrt-pcr and the fact that no virus was isolated from tracheas removed from birds primarily infected with beaur-4/91s and challenged with ibv 4/91uk a degree of heterologous protection against m41 challenge was observed albeit at a lower level our results confirm and extend our previous findings and conclusions that swapping of the ectodomain of the s protein is a precise and effective way of generating genetically defined candidate ibv vaccines
this study was carried out to evaluate the vaccination effect of a virus-like particle vlp including the surface antigen 1 sag1 of toxoplasma gondii as a potential vaccine for toxoplasmosis the sag1 virus-like particles sag1-vlps were expressed by sf9 cells and their expression was confirmed through cloning rt-pcr analysis and western blot method the immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of sag1-vlps were assessed by the antibody response cytokine analysis neutralization activity splenocyte assay and survival rates through a mouse model in particular igg igg1 igg2a and iga were markedly increased after immunization and the survival rates of t gondii were strongly inhibited by the immunized sera furthermore the immunization of sag1-vlps effectively decreased the production of specific cytokines such as il-1β il-6 tnf-α and ifn-γ after parasite infection in particular the immunized group showed strong activity and viability compared with the non-immunized infection group and their survival rate was 75%. these results demonstrate that sag1-vlp not only has the immunogenicity to block t gondii infection by effectively inducing the generation of specific antibodies against t gondii but is also an effective antigen delivery system for preventing toxoplasmosis this study indicates that sag1-vlp can be effectively utilized as a promising vaccine candidate for preventing or inhibiting t gondii infection

bats living in close contact with people in rwanda were tested for evidence of infection with viruses of zoonotic potential mucosal swabs from 503 bats representing 17 species were sampled from 2010 to 2014 and screened by consensus pcr for 11 viral families samples were negative for all viral families except coronaviruses which were detected in 27 bats belonging to eight species known coronaviruses detected included the betacorona viruses kenya bat coronaviruses eidolon bat coronavirus and bat coronavirus hku9 as well as an alphacoronavirus chaerephon bat coronavirus novel coronaviruses included two betacorona viruses clustering with sars-cov a 2d coronavirus and an alphacoronavirus
influenza is an acute respiratory disease and a major health problem worldwide since mucosal immunity plays a critical role in protection against influenza virus infection mucosal immunization is considered a promising vaccination route however except for live-attenuated vaccines there are no effective killed or recombinant mucosal influenza vaccines to date outer membrane vesicles omvs are nano-sized vesicles produced by gram-negative bacteria and contain various bacterial components capable of stimulating the immune system of the host we generated an omv with low endotoxicity fmomv by modifying the structure of the lipid a moiety of lipopolysaccharide and investigated its effect as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant in an influenza vaccine model in this model fmomv exhibited reduced toll-like receptor 4-stimulating activity and attenuated endotoxicity compared to that of native omv intranasal injection of the vaccine antigen with fmomv significantly increased systemic antibody and t cell responses mucosal iga levels and the frequency of lung-resident influenza-specific t cells in addition the number of antigen-bearing cd103 + dendritic cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes was significantly increased after fmomv co-administration notably the mice co-immunized with fmomv showed a significantly higher protection rate against challenge with a lethal dose of homologous or heterologous influenza viruses without adverse effects these results show the potential of fmomv as an effective mucosal adjuvant for intranasal vaccines
dengue virus is transmitted by aedes mosquitoes and infects at least 100 million people every year progressive urbanization in asia and south-central america and the geographic expansion of aedes mosquito habitats have accelerated the global spread of dengue resulting in a continuously increasing number of cases a cost-effective safe vaccine conferring protection with ideally a single injection could stop dengue transmission current vaccine candidates require several booster injections or do not provide protection against all four serotypes here we demonstrate that dengue virus mutants lacking 29-o-methyltransferase activity are highly sensitive to type i ifn inhibition the mutant viruses are attenuated in mice and rhesus monkeys and elicit a strong adaptive immune response monkeys immunized with a single dose of 29-omethyltransferase mutant virus showed 100% sero-conversion even when a dose as low as 1000 plaque forming units was administrated animals were fully protected against a homologous challenge furthermore mosquitoes feeding on blood containing the mutant virus were not infected whereas those feeding on blood containing wild-type virus were infected and thus able to transmit it these results show the potential of 29-o-methyltransferase mutant virus as a safe rationally designed dengue vaccine that restrains itself due to the increased susceptibility to the host's innate immune response
human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection represents one of the major health threats in the developing world the costly treatment of infected individuals with multiple highly efficient anti-hiv drugs is only affordable in industrialized countries thus an efficient vaccination strategy is required to prevent the further spread of the infection the molecular biology of coronaviruses and particular features of the human coronavirus 229e hcov 229e indicate that hcov 229e-based vaccine vectors can become a new class of highly efficient vaccines first the receptor of hcov 229e human aminopeptidase n hapn or cd13 is expressed mainly on human dendritic cells dcs and macrophages indicating that targeting of hcov 229e-based vectors to professional antigen presenting cells can be achieved by receptor-mediated transduction second hcov 229e structural genes can be replaced by multiple transcriptional units encoding various antigens these virus-like particles vlps containing hcov 229e-based vector rna have the ability to transduce human dcs and to mediate heterologous gene expression in these cells finally coronavirus infections are associated with mainly respiratory and enteric diseases and natural transmission of coronaviruses occurs via mucosal surfaces in humans hcov 229e causes common cold by infecting the upper respiratory tract hcov 229e infections are mainly encountered in children and re-infection occurs frequently in adults it is thus most likely that pre-existing immunity against hcov 229e will not significantly impact on the vaccination efficiency if hcov 229e-based vectors are used in humans
from 2005 to 2013 17 ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis at the authors' practices clinical findings included ocular respiratory and digestive abnormalities diagnosis was based on histopathology specific histochemical stains and/or on polymerase chain reaction all bacteria identified belonged to the nontuberculous mycobacterium complex several treatment protocols were attempted frequently based on the use of enrofloxacin in all 3 ferrets were considered cured mycobacteriosis in ferrets is a polymorphous disease with diverse clinical presentations it is also likely an underdiagnosed disease in pet ferrets which appear to be particularly susceptible to environmental sources mycobacteriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis for ocular respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in particular it should be differentiated from systemic coronavirus infection
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv a recently discovered arterivirus swine pathogen was shown to undergo homologous recombination co-infection of ma-104 cells with two culture-adapted north american prrsv strains resulted in recombinant viral particles containing chimeric orf 3 and orf 4 proteins nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned recombinant pcr products encompassing 1182 bases of the 15.4 kb viral genome revealed six independent recombination events recombinant products persisted in culture for at least three passages indicating continuous formation of recombinant viruses growth of recombinant viruses in competition with parental viruses or both the frequency of recombination was estimated from b 2% up to 10% in the 1182 b fragment analyzed which is similar to recombination frequencies observed in coronaviruses an apparent example of natural orf 5 recombination between naturally occurring wild type viruses was also found indicating that recombination is likely an important genetic mechanism contributing to prrsv evolution
background canine parvovirus cpv is an important pathogen that causes acute enteric disease in dogs it has mutated and spread throughout the world in dog populations we provide an update on the molecular characterization of cpv that circulated in nanjing a provincial capital in china between 2009 and 2012 results seventy rectal swab samples were collected from the dogs diagnosed with cpv infection in 8 animal hospitals of nanjing sequence analysis of vp2 genes of 31 samples revealed that 29 viral strains belonged to cpv-2a subtype while other two strains were classified into cpv-2b to investigate the pathogenicity of the prevalent virus we isolated cpv-2a and performed the animal experiment nine beagles were inoculated with 10 5.86 of 50% tissue culture infectious doses tcid 50 of the virus all the experimentally infected beagles exhibited mild to moderate mucoid or watery diarrhea on day 4 post-infection p i on day 9 p i characteristic histopathological lesions were clearly observed in multiple organs of infected dogs including liver spleen kidney brain and all segments of the small and large intestines while viral dna and antigen staining could be detected in the sampled tissues it is notable that canine parvovirus was isolated in one from two brain samples processed conclusion our results indicated that cpv-2a is the predominant subtype in nanjing of china and this virus caused extensive lesions in a variety of tissues including the brain
certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa- lyssa- corona- and filoviruses which may pose serious threats to human health the common vampire bat desmodus rotundus due to its abundance sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals and highly social behavioral ecology may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in d rotundus yet the diversity of other viruses bacteria and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown we screened 396 blood urine saliva and fecal samples from d rotundus captured in guatemala for 13 viral families and genera positive results were found for rhabdovirus adenovirus and herpesvirus assays we also screened these samples for bartonella spp and found that 38% of individuals tested positive to characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated with feeding behavior we also analyzed cytochrome b sequences from fecal samples to identify prey species and found that domestic cattle bos taurus made up the majority of blood meals our findings suggest that the risk of pathogen spillover from desmodus rotundus including between domestic animal species is possible and warrants further investigation to characterize this microbial diversity and expand our understanding of foraging ecology in their populations
parasitic hpenoptera attacking phyllonwycter species mining leaves of oak and birch were studied at a cheshire locality during 1974 the host developmental stages killed and attacked by each parasite species are analysed smaller species and males tend to kill earlier phyllonorycter instars than do larger species and females and certain of the endoparasites as well as the ectoparasites must discriminate between small hosts which receive haploid eggs and large hosts which receive diploid eggs hostfeeding is very widely practised and facultative hyperparasitism is engaged in by all except the braconids and a few specialized chalcids the biology of a parasite species generally allows its allocation to one of three groups according to the size of host larva that it attacks whether it is endoparasitic or ectoparasitic whether or not the host continues to develop after parasitization the extent of its hyperparasitic behaviour its reproductive capacity and the width of its host range different strategies together with different specific host and habitat preferences provide the basis for parasite complexes of high species diversity
the ecology of ebola virus ebv remains largely unknown but the previous detection of viral rna and anti-ebv antibodies in african bats suggests that they might play a role in the ebv reservoir moreover african bats also carry other potentially zoonotic agents such as henipah-like viruses coronaviruses and lyssaviruses today only little information is available on interactions between humans and bats the objective of our exploratory study was to describe the extent and modes of contacts between humans and bats in southern cameroon considered as an area at risk for future ebv outbreaks the survey was conducted in 11 villages of four distinct rural areas in southern cameroon a total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires between february and may 2017 the study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three and 28% of respondents hunt them about 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats indirect contact also appeared to be common 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats bat consumption varied significantly between regions from 0% to 87% and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme southeast of cameroon the study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self-hunted bushmeat geographical diversity of contacts and perceptions regarding bats in cameroon emphasizes the need to adjust zoonotic pathogen surveillance and education campaigns to the specificities of the communities and their context of interaction with wildlife bat cameroon central africa ebola risk behaviour zoonotic transmission | 289 baudel et al
mycobacterium tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death attributed to a single infectious organism bacillus calmette-guerin bcg the standard vaccine against m tuberculosis is thought to prevent only 5% of all vaccine-preventable deaths due to tuberculosis thus an alternative vaccine is required one of the principal barriers to vaccine development against m tuberculosis is the complexity of the immune response to infection with uncertainty as to what constitutes an immunological correlate of protection in this paper we seek to give an overview of the immunology of m tuberculosis infection and by doing so investigate possible targets of vaccine development this encompasses the innate adaptive mucosal and humoral immune systems though mva85a did not improve protection compared with bcg alone in a large-scale clinical trial the correlates of protection this has revealed in addition to promising results from candidate such as vpm1002 m72/aso1e and h56ic31 point to a brighter future in the field of tb vaccine development
in this study we were interested in determining if high titered egg adapted modified live infectious bronchitis virus ibv vaccines contain spike gene related quasispecies that undergo selection in chickens following vaccination we sequenced the spike glycoprotein of 12 ibv vaccines 5 different serotypes from 3 different manufacturers directly from the vaccine vial then compared that sequence with reisolated viruses from vaccinated and contact-exposed birds over time we found differences in the s1 sequence within the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers differences in s1 sequence between different vaccine serials from the same manufacturer and intra-vaccine differences or quasispecies comparing the sequence data of the reisolated viruses with the original vaccine virus we were able to identify in vivo selection of viral subpopulations as well as mutations to our knowledge this is the first report showing selection of a more fit virus subpopulation as well as mutations associated with replication of modified live ibv vaccine viruses in chickens this information is important for our understanding of how attenuated virus vaccines including potential vaccines against the sars-cov can ensure long-term survival of the virus and can lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new viral pathogens this information is also valuable for the development of safer modified live coronavirus vaccines
this paper was accepted by plos one on oct 23 2012 however on nov.15 2012 informed us that the accept decision will be rescinded we do not sure whether there is some interference from some persons who might read our paper during otc 23-nov 15 2012 sars-cov is believed to originate from civets and was thought to have been eliminated as a threat after the 2003 outbreak here we show that human sars-cov husars-cov originated directly from bats rather than civets by a cross-species jump in 1991 and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998 since then husars-cov has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype t and a 29-nt deletion mutation and weakly virulent strains with genotype c but without the 29-nt deletion the former can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the sars outbreak whereas the latter might not cause pneumonia in humans but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ace2 as an entry receptor leading to interspecies transmission between humans and civets three crucial time points -1991 for the cross-species jump from bats to humans 1998 for the formation of the human-adapted sars-cov and 2003 when there was an outbreak of sars in humans -were found to associate with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in guangdong anti-sars-cov sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested from guangzhou children who were born after 2005 suggesting that weakly virulent husars-covs might still exist in humans these existing but undetected sars-covs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable climate conditions occur highlighting a potential risk for the reemergence of sars resultsthe spike s protein of sars-cov is responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells and plays a crucial role in viral cross-species transmission . to investigate the origin of sars-cov we constructed a time-scaled maximum clade credibility mcc tree using sars-cov s gene sequences from humans civets and bats for inferring the ancestral host state of viruses fig 1 . in the tree all husars-covs and pcsars-covs are divided into two sub-clades one sub-clade i containing all 2003 husars-covs with one exception and another sub-clade ii including all pcsars-covs and two husars-covs strains within sub-clades i and ii have the most recent common ancestors mrcas at nodes d and f respectively and share an earlier ancestor at node c the ancestral host states of mrcas were estimated to be exclusively human at nodes c d and f fig 1 left upper panel indicating a transmission route from humans to civets . all batsars-covs form two sub-clades one is located at the most basal position of the tree and another clusters with the clade comprising husars-covs and pcsars-covs and shares a mrca at node b fig 1 . the ancestral host states of mrcas most likely are bat at both nodes a and b fig 1 left upper panel suggesting a cross-species transmission from bats
sustained adaptive immunity to pathogens provides effective protection against infections and effector cells located at the site of infection ensure rapid response to the challenge both are essential for the success of vaccine development to explore new vaccination approach against mycobacterium tuberculosis m tb infection we have shown that rv3615c identified as esx-1 substrate protein c of m tb but not expressed in bcg induced a dominant th1-type response of cd4 + t cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy which suggests a potential candidate for vaccine development but subcutaneous immunization with rv3615c induced modest t-cell responses systemically and showed suboptimal protection against virulent m tb challenge at the site of infection here we use a mouse model to demonstrate that intranasal immunization with rv3615c induces sustained capability of adaptive cd4 + t-and b-cell responses in lung parenchyma and airway rv3615c contains a dominant epitope of mouse cd4 + t cells rv3615c 41-50 and elicits cd4 + t-cellresponse with an effector-memory phenotype and multi-th1-type cytokine coexpressions since t cells resident at mucosal tissue are potent at control of infection at early stage our data show that intranasal immunization with rv3615c promotes a sustained regional immunity to m tb and suggests a potency in control of m tb infection our study warranties a further investigation of rv3615c as a candidate for development of effective vaccination against m tb infection adaptive immunity cd4 intranasal mucosal mycobacterium tuberculosis rv3615c th1
enteric viruses are a major cause of diarrhea in animals and humans among them rotaviruses are one of the most important causes of diarrhea in young animals and human infants a lack of understanding of mechanisms to induce intestinal immunity and the correlates of protective immunity in neonates has impaired development of safe and effective vaccines against enteric viruses studies of candidate vaccines using an adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections often do not predict vaccine ef®cacy against disease evaluated in neonatal large animals a series of studies have been conducted using a neonatal gnotobiotic pig model of rotavirus infection and diarrhea to identify correlates of protective immunity and to evaluate traditional and novel vaccine approaches for the induction of mucosal immune responses and protection to enteric viruses gnotobiotic pigs recovered from infection with virulent wa human rotavirus hrv mimic natural infection had high numbers of intestinal iga rotavirus-speci®c primary antibody-secreting cells ascs and memory b-cells to recall antigen measured by elispot assay which correlated with complete protection against rotavirus challenge most short-term iga memory b-cells were resident in the ileum the major site of rotavirus replication spleen not the bone marrow was the major resident site for longer-term igg memory b-cells candidate rotavirus vaccines evaluated in pigs for their ability to induce intestinal or systemic asc and protection against rotavirus infection and diarrhea included attenuated live virus inactivated virus and baculovirus-expressed double-layered rotavirus-like particles 2/6-vlps in combination with those candidate vaccines various adjuvants delivery systems and immunization routes were tested including incomplete freund's adjuvant for i m immunization and a mutant escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin r192g mlt for i n immunization it was shown that orally administered replicating vaccines were most effective for priming for intestinal iga asc and memory b-cell responses but i n administered nonreplicating 2/6-vlps plus mlt were effective as booster vaccines we conclude that protective immunity depends on the magnitude location viral protein-speci®city and isotype of the antibody responses induced by vaccination therefore highly effective enteric viral vaccines should i induce suf®cient levels of intestinal iga antibodies ii include viral antigens that induce neutralizing antibodies and iii require the use of effective mucosal adjuvants or antigen delivery systems for nonreplicating oral or i n vaccines #
human coronaviruses hcovs are large rna viruses that infect the human respiratory tract the emergence of both severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome covs as well as the yearly circulation of four common covs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds various animal models have been established to investigate hcov infection including mice and non-human primates to establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans an organotypic human airway culture system that recapitulates the human airway epithelium has been developed currently different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways including the air-liquid interface ali human airway epithelium hae model tracheobronchial hae cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli these organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines additionally the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals no commercial vaccine is available but various effective antivirals have been identified some with potential for human treatment these morphological airway cultures are also well suited for the identification of antivirals evaluation of compound toxicity and viral inhibition
human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv is an important cause of severe respiratory tract disease in immunocompromised patients animal models are indispensable for evaluating novel intervention strategies in this complex patient population to complement existing models in rodents and non-human primates we have evaluated the potential benefits of an hrsv infection model in ferrets mustela putorius furo nine-to 12-month-old hrsv-seronegative immunocompetent or immunocompromised ferrets were infected with a low-passage wild-type strain of hrsv subgroup a 10 5 tcid 50 administered by intra-tracheal or intra-nasal inoculation immune suppression was achieved by bi-daily oral administration of tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone throat and nose swabs were collected daily and animals were euthanized four seven or 21 days post-infection dpi virus loads were determined by quantitative virus culture and qpcr we observed efficient hrsv replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract in immunocompromised ferrets virus loads reached higher levels and showed delayed clearance as compared to those in immunocompetent animals histopathological evaluation of animals euthanized 4 dpi demonstrated that the virus replicated in the respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea bronchi and bronchioles these animal models can contribute to an assessment of the efficacy and safety of novel hrsv intervention strategies
bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv has been recognised as an important pathogen in calf pneumonia for 30 years but surprisingly few effective infection models for studies of the immune response and the pathogenesis in the natural host have been established we present a reproducible experimental infection model for brsv in 2-5-month-old conventionally reared jersey calves thirty-four colostrum-fed calves were inoculated once by aerosol and intratracheal injection with brsv respiratory disease was recorded in 91% of the brsv-inoculated calves 72% had an accompanying rise in rectal temperature and 83% exhibited >5% consolidation of the lung tissue the disease closely resembled natural outbreaks of brsv-related pneumonia and detection of brsv in nasal secretions and lung tissues confirmed the primary role of brsv nine mock-inoculated control calves failed to develop respiratory disease this model is a valuable tool for the study of the pathogenesis of brsv and for vaccine efficacy studies
currently under evaluation as a human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 vaccine vector the most compelling reasons to develop rvsv as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture numerous preclinical studies with rvsv vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility flexibility and potential efficacy of the rvsv vaccine platform when administered to nonhuman primates nhps rvsv vectors expressing hiv-1 gag and env elicited robust hiv-1specific cellular and humoral immune responses and animals immunized with rvsv vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus siv gag and hiv env were protected from aids after challenge with a pathogenic siv/hiv recombinant however results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in nhps indicated that these prototypic rvsv vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations to address this safety concern a variety of different attenuation strategies designed to produce a range of further attenuated rvsv vectors are currently under investigation additional modifications of further attenuated rvsv vectors to upregulate expression of hiv-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation
hepatitis a virus hav is a wide spread pathogenic agent and is the common cause of acute hepatitis a worldwide passive immunization of hav plays an extremely important role in postexposure prophylaxis with clinical applications often requiring large amounts of antibody as an alternative to the in vitro production of recombinant proteins expression of monoclonal antibodies mabs in the milk of transgenic animals is currently used being associated with low production costs and high activity in this paper eight founder lines of transgenic mice were generated by co-microinjection of the two cassettes encoding the heavy-and light-chains of a neutralizing anti-hav antibody respectively the expressed heavy-and light-chains of the mab were correctly assembled and modified in the mammary gland as detected by western blotting high expression levels of the antibody were achieved during the lactation period and found to be independent of the copy numbers of integrated transgenes the highest level was up to 32.2 mg/ml the binding specificity and neutralizing activity of the expressed mab were assayed by elisa and neutralizing test showing that it is capable to neutralize the jn strain of hepatitis a virus efficiently therefore our results suggest that a large-scale and efficient production of the anti-hav mab in the milk of transgenic farm animals would be feasible in the future
background diarrhea in piglets directly affects commercial swine production the disease results from the interaction of pathogens with the host immune system and is also affected by management procedures several pathogenic agents such as campylobacter spp clostridium perfringens escherichia coli salmonella spp group a rotavirus rv-a coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus as well as nematode and protozoan parasites can be associated with disease cases results all bacterial viral protozoan and parasitic agents here investigated with the exception of salmonella spp as well as both coronaviruses were detected in varying proportions in piglet fecal samples and positive animals were equally distributed between case and control groups a statistically significant difference between case and control groups was found only for cystoisospora suis p = 0.034 and eimeria spp p = 0.047 when co-infections were evaluated a statistically significant difference was found only for c perfringens β2 and c suis p = 0.014 the presence of pathogens in piglets alone does not determine the occurrence of diarrhea episodes thus the indiscriminate use of antibiotic and anthelminthic medication should be re-evaluated this study also reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis and correct interpretation of results as well as the relevance of control and prophylactic measures
cases of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov continue to be identified and with a lack of effective clinical treatment and no preventative strategies treatment using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies mabs is a potential quick route to an intervention passive immunotherapy via either convalescent plasma or mabs has proven to be effective for other infectious agents following infection with mers-cov common marmosets were treated with high titer hyperimmune plasma or the mab m336 at 6 and 48 h post inoculation both treatments reduced signs of clinical disease but reduction in viral loads in the respiratory tract were only found in the hyperimmune plasma group a decrease in gross pathology was found only in the mab-treated group but no histological differences were observed between treated and control animals while both hyperimmune plasma and the m336 treatments reduced the severity of disease in the common marmoset neither treatment resulted in full protection against disease
equine coronavirus ecov is considered to be involved in enteric diseases in foals recently several outbreaks of ecov infection have also been reported in adult horses from the usa france and japan epidemiological studies of ecov infection are still limited and the seroprevalence of ecov infection in europe is unknown in this study an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa method utilizing ecov spike s1 protein was developed in two formats and further validated by analyzing 27 paired serum samples acute and convalescent sera from horses involved in an ecov outbreak and 1084 sera of horses with unknown ecov exposure both formats showed high diagnostic accuracy compared to virus neutralization vn assay receiver-operating characteristic roc analyses were performed to determine the best cut-off values for both elisa formats assuming a test specificity of 99%. employing the developed elisa method we detected seroconversion in 70.4% of horses from an ecov outbreak among the 1084 horse sera seropositivity varied from 25.9% young horses to 82.8% adult horses in dutch horse populations further sera of icelandic horses were included in this study and a significant number of sera 62% were found to be positive overall the results demonstrated that the ecov s1-based elisa has reliable diagnostic performance compared to the vn assay and is a useful assay to support seroconversion in horses involved with ecov outbreaks and to estimate ecov seroprevalence in populations of horses
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes high mortality in neonatal piglets however effective and safe vaccines are still not available we hypothesized that inactivation of the 2=-o-methyltransferase 2=-o-mtase activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates pedv yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs we generated a recombinant pedv kdke 4a with quadruple alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad of the 2=-o-mtase using a virulent infectious cdna clone icpc22a as the backbone next we constructed another mutant kdke 4a -sya by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of kdke 4a . compared with icpc22a the kdke 4a and kdke 4a -sya mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type i and type iii interferon responses the pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets the virulence of kdke 4a -sya and kdke 4a was significantly reduced compared with that of icpc22a mortality rates were 100% 17% and 0% in the icpc22a- kdke 4a - and kdke 4a -sya-inoculated groups respectively at 21 days postinoculation dpi all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icpc22a the kdke 4a -sya-and kdke 4a -inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge because no kdke 4a -sya-and one kdke 4a -inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea and 33% of them died furthermore we serially passaged the kdke 4a -sya mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations the data suggest that kdke 4a -sya may be a pedv vaccine candidate importance pedv is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available 2=-o-mtase nsp16 is highly conserved among coronaviruses covs and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses we show that inactivation of both 2=-o-mtase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for pedv the in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the kdke 4a -sya mutant kdke 4a -sya warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for cov vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging covs
a better understanding of the seroprevalence and specificity of influenza ha stem-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs in the human population could significantly inform influenza vaccine design efforts here we utilized probes comprising headless ha stabilized stem ss to determine the prevalence binding and neutralization breadth of antibodies directed to ha stem-epitope in a crosssectional analysis of the general population five group-1 ha ss probes representing five subtypes were chosen for this analyses eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to h1 probes and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes thirty percent of analyzed sera had cross-reactivity to at least four of five probes and this reactivity could be blocked by competing with f10 bnab binding cross-reactivity in sera samples significantly correlated with frequency of h1 + h5 + cross-reactive b cells interestingly only 33% of the cross-reactive sera neutralized both h1n1 and h5n1 pseudoviruses cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies were more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age our data demonstrate the need to use multiple ha-stem probes to assess for broadly reactive antibodies further a universal vaccine could be designed to boost pre-existing b-cells expressing stem-directed bnabs published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/ 2 scientific reports | 2018 88628 |
infections caused by fasciola hepatica are of great importance in the veterinary field as they cause important economic losses to livestock producers serodiagnostic methods typically elisa with either native or recombinant antigens are often used for early diagnosis the use of native antigens as in the mm3-sero elisa commercialized as bio k 211 bio-x diagnostics continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity however there is interest in developing elisa tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites of the antigens secreted by adult flukes recombinant procathepsin l1 rfhpcl1 is the most commonly tested in elisa to date however although adult flukes produce three different clades of cls fhcl1 fhcl2 and fhcl5 to our knowledge the diagnostic value of recombinant fhcl2 and fhcl5 has not yet been investigated in the present study we developed and tested three indirect elisas using rfhpcl1 rfhpcl2 and rfhpcl5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with f hepatica although the overall antibody response to these three rfhpcls was similar some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rfhpcls moreover for cattle sera the highest sensitivity was obtained using rfhpcl2 97% being equal for both rfhpcl1 and rfhpcl5 87.9% after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity by contrast for sheep sera the sensitivity was 100% for the three rfhpcls finally the presence of truncated and/or partially unfolded molecules in antigen preparations is postulated as a possible source of cross-reactivity
disease-modifying treatments including immunosuppressive treatments have shown positive effects on the disease course but are associated with systemic consequences on the immune system and may increase the risk of infections and alter vaccine efficiency therefore vaccination of ms patients is of major interest over the last years vaccine hesitancy has steadily grown especially in western countries partly due to fear of sequelae arising from vaccination especially neurological disorders the interaction of vaccination and ms has been discussed for decades in this review we highlight the immunology of vaccination provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of ms vaccination and immunosuppression in conclusion there is consensus that ms cannot be caused by vaccines neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines however particular attention should be paid to two aspects first in immunocompromised patients live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated albeit in weakened form second protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment in conclusion there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen ms thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections therefore vaccination should be in general recommended to ms patients
there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines against pneumonic plague a highly lethal and contagious disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pestis here we demonstrate that a novel dna vaccine expressing a modified v antigen lcrv of y pestis with a human tissue plasminogen activator tpa signal sequence elicited strong v-specific antibody responses in balb/c mice this tpa-v dna vaccine protected mice from intranasal challenge with lethal doses of y pestis in comparison a dna vaccine expressing the wild type v antigen was much less effective only tpa-v formed oligomers spontaneously and elicited a higher igg2a anti-v antibody response in immunized mice suggesting increased t h 1 type cellular immune response our data indicate that antigen engineering is effective in inducing high quality protective immune responses against conformationally sensitive antigens these results support that optimized dna vaccines have the potential to protect against bacterial pathogens than is generally recognized
interest in the potential of monoclonal antibodies mabs to serve as therapeutic agents has surged in the past decade with a major emphasis on human viral diseases there has been much attention in this area directed towards the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 hiv-1 and promising research developments have emerged on the inhibition of hiv-1 infection by mabs and the identification of several highly conserved neutralizing epitopes more recently potent fully-human neutralizing mabs have been developed against a variety of important human viral disease agents including the paramyxoviruses hendra virus and nipah virus and human or humanized mabs have been developed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and west nile virus among others most of these more recently developed antiviral mabs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies and the implementation of simplified inexpensive yet efficient methods for expressing and purifying the initially selected fragment antibodies is of prime importance in further facilitating this area of research
four single-chain variable fragments scfvs against protective antigen pa and 2 scfvs against lethal factor lf of anthrax were isolated from a phage display library generated from immunized chimpanzees only 2 scfvs recognizing pa w1 and w2 neutralized the cytotoxicity of lethal toxin in a macrophage lysis assay full-length immunoglobulin g igg of w1 and w2 efficiently protected rats from anthrax toxin challenge the epitope recognized by w1 and w2 was conformational and was formed by c-terminal amino acids 614-735 of pa w1 and w2 each bound to pa with an equilibrium dissociation constant of mol/l to 5 ϫ11 4 ϫ 10 ϫ 10 ϫ11 mol/l which is an affinity that is 20-100-fold higher than that for the interaction of the receptor and pa w1 and w2 inhibited the binding of pa to the receptor suggesting that this was the mechanism of protection these data suggest that w1 and w2 chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies may serve as pa entry inhibitors for use in the emergency prophylaxis against and treatment of anthrax
recent cases of emergent diseases have renewed interest in the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that promote parasite adaptation to novel hosts . crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original susceptible hosts and novel hosts an increase in the frequency of the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host and reduced selection to infect novel hosts caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching . the probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host we tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible original and resistant novel host bacteria viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when susceptible hosts were at frequencies between 0.1% and 1%. subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies respectively these results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions and that small changes in contact rates between host species might help to mitigate disease emergence
many major human diseases derive from autoimmune reactions directed against particular organ or tissue antigens as can be demonstrated by immunohistologic studies one disease in which a virus-triggered autoimmune phenomenon has been postulated is multiple sclerosis ms.' the strongest evidence in support of a viral etiology of ms comes from epidemiologic studies that suggest that ms derives from environmental factors operating years before the onset of the clinical manifestations of the disease this evidence consists of age-specific tables geographic distribution and patterns of migration and family clustering of the cases of ms the hypothesis derived from these studies holds that a patient with ms is exposed at puberty or shortly thereafter to an infectious agent that triggers the disease besides the epidemiologic evidence many investigators have found an increase in virus-specific antibodies against certain enveloped viruses in patients with ms suggesting that these viruses could be candidate causative agents however thus far all attempts at isolation or identification of a particular virus as the cause of ms have failed this failure is the more perplexing because a number of viruses have been isolated from the brains of patients with ms none of which could be unequivocally related to the disease despite these failures the hypothesis of a viral etiology of ms remains viable because of the available circumstantial evidence it is reasonable to assume that a virus or several viruses can trigger an autoimmune reaction against brain antigens which can then continue and thus can perpetuate the disease even when the virus is no longer around in an attempt to test the validity of this theory we developed an animal model the lewis rat infected with either the murine coronavirus jhm or a neurotropic measles virus both viruses cause central nervous system cns disease and trigger an autoimmune reaction mediated by t cells
development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov is crucial in the prevention of sars reemergence the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike s protein is an important target in developing safe and effective sars vaccines our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adenoassociated virus encoding rbd rbd-raav induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies in this study we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with rbd-raav prime/rbd-specific t cell peptide boost compared with the rbd-raav prime/boost vaccination rbd-raav prime/rbd-peptide rbd-pep boost induced similar levels of th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge but stronger th2 and ctl responses no significant immune responses and protective effects were detected in mice vaccinated with rbd-pep or blank aav alone since t cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory t cells which may be effective against viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective broad and long-term protection against sars-cov infection
the live replication-competent modified vaccinia virus tiantan mvtt is an attractive vaccine vector yet little is known about its tissue tropism and pathology in vivo recently we demonstrated that a recombinant mvtt expressing the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov namely mvtt-s is superior to the non-replicating modified vaccinia ankara mva-s for inducing high level of neutralizing antibodies through mucosal vaccination in this study we further determined the tissue tropism and safety of mvtt-s after the vaccine was administrated through various routes including intramuscular i m intranasal i n and intravaginal i vag inoculations respectively using real-time pcr nested pcr immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays we found that mvtt-s was able to produce a transient infection in all cases within 48 hr post-inoculation yet the major site of viral replication in various tissues or organs was dependent on the route of viral administration we demonstrated that i m injection of mvtt-s primarily targeted draining inguinal lymph nodes whereas mucosal inoculation had broader range of tissue infections i n inoculation involved infections in lungs kidneys spleens and cervix lymph nodes while i vag administration targeted uteruses ovaries kidneys and spleens critically the infection did not cause severe pathogenic consequences in infected tissues which was consistent to the attenuated phenotype of mvtt-s our findings have implications for the optimization of vaccination route and for studies on the correlation between the magnitude of immune responses and the extent of tissue involvement in vivo
nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev are recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses exclusively grouped within a new genus henipavirus these viruses cause fatal disease in a wide range of species including humans both niv and hev have continued to re-emerge sporadically in bangladesh and australia respectively there are currently no therapeutics or vaccines available to treat henipavirus infection and both are classified as bsl4 pathogens rna interference rnai is a process by which double-stranded rna directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger rna in animal and plant cells small interfering rnas sirnas mediate rnai by inhibiting gene expression of homologous mrna and our preliminary studies suggest rnai may be a useful approach to developing novel therapies for these highly lethal pathogens eight niv sirna molecules four l and four n gene specific two hev n gene specific and two non-specific control sirna molecules were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit a henipavirus minigenome replication system which does not require the use of live virus in addition to live virus infections in vitro in the minigenome assay three out of the four sirnas that targeted the l gene of niv effectively inhibited replication in contrast only niv n gene sirnas were effective in reducing live niv replication suggesting inhibition of early abundantly expressed gene transcripts may be more effective than later less abundant transcripts additionally some of the sirnas effective against niv infection were only partially effective inhibitors of hev infection an inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of sirna inhibition was observed the demonstration that rnai effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro is a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal zoonotic pathogens
an analysis of hospitalizations for acute respiratory disease in recruits immunized with adenovirus type 4 and type 7 vaccines am j epidemiol 95 1972.-among 911 recruits immunized with live oral adenovirus types 4 and 7 adv-4 and 7 vaccines there were 149 hospital admissions to the acute respiratory disease ard wards during the study eighteen admissions were not associated with ard 15 rubella infections 3 immunization reactions of the remaining 131 ard admissions 17 were complicated by pneumonia and 114 were judged to have uncomplicated ard within the latter group evidence for infection by a single respiratory pathogen was obtained from 68 admissions 11 admissions were associated with multiple infectious agents and 35 admissions yielded no infectious agents despite immunization adenoviruses primarily adv-4 were still the most common cause of ard among non-adenovirus associated ard admissions rhinoviruses were the most common 10 followed by influenza a 2 virus 7 group a streptococci 2 and herpesvirus hominis 2 thus in this initial study of ard among recruits immunized with adv-4 and adv-7 vaccines no other respiratory pathogens emerged to replace adenovirus types 4 and 7 as the major causes of ard in military trainees

canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide the role of canine parvovirus cpv in canine viral diarrhea is a common health problem in dogs attracting major concern from veterinarians and dog owners across china in this mini-review we summarize the cpv epidemiology in china including its origin prevalence coinfection and the genetic evolution of the virus the review reveals the correlation between cpv-2 infection and seasonality a dog's age/gender/breed/vaccination that cpv-2 is the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in northeast china and that coinfection with other pathogens is a common occurrence the predominant cpv epidemic strains were the new cpv-2a and cpv-2c has shown significant growth trends since 2010 this mini-review will provide valuable information for cpv infections across china and other countries
in this study we attempted to define differences in the hemagglutininesterase he glycoprotein between 11 bovine coronaviruses bcv recent post-1991 and past pre-1991 isolates from neonatal calf diarrhoea ncd and winter dysentery wd syndromes as a basis for strain differentiation related to the clinical source of the isolates the five wd-associated bcv isolates studied could be distinguished from past ncd-isolates by their hemagglutinating ha properties at 4 • and 37 • c their receptor-destroying enzyme rde activities with rat erythrocytes and lack of reactivity of these ncd isolates to four ha inhibiting hai monoclonal antibodies mabs directed against the he glycoprotein of the reference wd-associated bcq.2590 quebec strain although minor or no differences could be demonstrated by comparing biological properties of the he of wd-isolates to those of recent ncd-isolates past ncd isolates lacked reactivity with the wd hai mabs whereas recent ncd isolates displayed two distinct reactivity patterns attempts to define sequence differences in the he genes of the wd and ncd strains revealed high nucleotide nt identities with only scattered amino acid differences seemingly unrelated to the clinical origin of the isolates or hai mab reactivities * bovine coronavirus bcv is an important enteropathogenic agent of the bovine species which replicates in the mature enterocytes of the small intestine and colon causing severe diarrhoea in neonatal calves ncd and chronic shedding in adult cattle ad . the virus has been reported to be also responsible for acute enteric infection in adult cattle during the winter season
the objective of this study to design a delivery system resistant to the gastrointestinal environment for oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus lactococcus lactis nz9000 was transformed with segments of vp4 of the porcine rotavirus inserted into the pnz8112 surface-expression vector and a recombinant l lactis expressing vp4 protein was constructed an approximately 27 kda vp4 protein was confirmed by sds-page western blot and immunostaining analysis balb/c mice were immunized orally with vp4-expression recombinant l lactis and cellular mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses were examined specific anti-vp4 secretory iga and igg were found in feces ophthalmic and vaginal washes and in serum the induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on porcine rotavirus infection on ma104 cells our findings suggest that oral immunization with vp4-expressing l lactis induced both specific local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses in mice
feline immunodeficiency virus fiv causes aids in the domestic cat felis catus but has not been explicitly associated with aids pathology in any of the eight free-ranging species of felidae that are endemic with circulating fiv strains african lion panthera leo populations are infected with lion-specific fiv strains fivple yet there remains uncertainty about the degree to which fiv infection impacts their health reported cd4+ t-lymphocyte depletion in fivple-infected lions and anecdotal reports of lion morbidity associated with fiv seroprevalence emphasize the concern as to whether fivple is innocuous or pathogenic here we monitored clinical biochemical histological and serological parameters among fivple-positive n = 47 as compared to fivple-negative n = 17 lions anesthetized and sampled on multiple occasions between 1999 and 2006 in botswana relative to uninfected lions fivple-infected lions displayed a significant elevation in the prevalence of aids-defining conditions lymphadenopathy gingivitis tongue papillomas dehydration and poor coat condition as well as displaying abnormal red blood cell parameters depressed serum albumin and elevated liver enzymes and gamma globulin spleen and lymph node biopsies from free-ranging fivple-infected lions n = 9 revealed evidence of lymphoid depletion the hallmark pathology documented in immunodeficiency virus infections of humans hiv-1 macaques and domestic cats we conclude that over time fivple infections in free-ranging lions can lead to adverse clinical immunological and pathological outcomes in some individuals that parallel sequelae caused by lentivirus infection in humans hiv asian macaques siv and domestic cats fivfca
background clostridium difficile infection cdi is recognised as an emerging disease in both humans and some animal species during the past few years insights into human cdi epidemiology changed and c difficile is also considered as an emerging community-acquired pathogen certain ribotypes rt are possibly associated with zoonotic transmission the objective of this study was to assess the presence of c difficile in a population of pets and to characterise the isolates results faecal samples from a total of 90 diarrhoeic dogs and 24 from exotic animal species both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic were analysed clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 6.7% dogs and one reptile sample 4.2%. four 66.7% of the six dog strains were capable of producing toxins four known different rts were detected in dogs 010 014 123 and 358 and a new one was found in a faecal sample of an exotic animal this new rt isolate was negative for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347 which has been proposed as a clade-iii member importantly two dog strains showed a stable resistance to metronidazole initial mic values 128 and 48 μg/ml the results obtained in this study suggest the implementation of antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of metronidazole resistance in dogs molecular studies to elucidate c difficile metronidazole resistance mechanisms are warranted based on the similarity between the ribotypes observed in dogs and those described in humans the zoonotic transmission should be further explored furthermore exotic animals have shown to harbor uncommon c difficile strains which require further genomic studies
feline infectious peritonitis is a devastating fatal disease of domestic cats caused by a pathogenic mutant virus derived from the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus fecv infection by fecv is generally subclinical and little is known about the mucosal immune response that controls and eliminates the virus we investigated the mucosal immune response against fecv in an endemically infected breeding colony over a seven-month period thirty-three cats were grouped according to fecv seropositivity and fecal virus shedding into naïve/immunologically quiescent convalescent and actively infected groups blood fecal samples and colon biopsies were collected to assess the mucosal and systemic immunologic and virologic profile results showed that cats with active fecv infections have strong systemic igg and mucosal iga responses that wane after virus clearance significant fecv-specific mucosal t cell ifnγ responses were not detected in any of the three groups a shift toward an inflammatory state in the mucosa was suggested by increased il17foxp3 expression however no histologic abnormalities were observed and no shifts in lymphocyte subpopulation phenotype or proliferation were noted together the results suggest that control of fecv is mediated by humoral mucosal and systemic responses and that perturbations in the primary reservoir organ colon are minimal
background rotavirus rv is a member of the reoviridae family and an important etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in the young rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals in this paper we report the first characterisation of a rv strain from a giraffe calf results this report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old giraffe giraffa camelopardalis presenting with acute diarrhea the rv strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as g10p . detailed sequence analysis of vp4 and vp7 revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to bovine rv borv this study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of rv strains in various animal populations which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported furthermore extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types

bats have been identified as natural reservoirs of many viruses including reoviruses recent studies have demonstrated the interspecies transmission of bat reoviruses to humans in this study we report the isolation and molecular characterization of six strains of mammalian orthoreovirus mrv from hipposideros and myotis spp these isolates were grouped into mrv serotype 1 2 or 3 based on the sequences of the s1 gene which encodes the outer coat protein s1 importantly we found that three of six bat mrv strains shared high similarity with mrvs isolated from diseased minks piglets or humans based on the s1 segment suggesting that interspecies transmission has occurred between bats and humans or animals phylogenetic analyses based on the 10 segments showed that the genomic segments of these bat mrvs had different evolution lineages suggesting that these bat mrvs may have arisen through reassortment of mrvs of different origins the genbank/embl/ddbj accession number for the genome sequences of btmrv wiv2-5 -7 and -8 are kt444522-kt444581 and for the partial rna-dependent rna polymerase sequences are kt444444-kt444521 one supplementary figure and 10 tables are available with the online supplementary material
to warrant potential clinical testing the equine anti-sars-cov fab′ 2 requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible and a safety test in a primate model in this study we evaluated the pharmacokinetics tolerance and immunity of this kind of antibody in macaques and rats results showed that the fab′ 2 fragments had a normal metabolism in injected animals the general physiological indexes did not differ between animals injected with anti-sars-cov fab′ 2 or saline however a mild inflammatory response in local injection site and a moderate immune response against this antibody in the successively injected animals were observed which however recovered 3 weeks after the last injection the antibody titring from 1100 to 400 against the equine anti-sars-cov fab′ 2 in the inoculated hosts could be detected at week 2 during the successive injections of the equine fab′ 2 . the considerable safety of this antibody used in primates and the fact that the immune system of the host can be motivated by post-injection of the fab′ 2 indicate that this type of anti-sars-cov antibody can be used for prevention and treatment of sasr especially at the early stage of this virus infection in addition it can also provide the precious time for the combined use of other anti-sars-cov agents such as antiviral drug and vaccine

the ability of avian coronaviruses to replicate in mice was investigated to investigate interspecies transmission two inbred mouse strains balb/c and a/j with different genetic backgrounds were inoculated with the avian coronavirus strains mass and br-i and monitored for at least 10 days analysis of viral rna histopathological examinations immunohistochemistry and serology were performed after virus inoculation neither clinical signs nor evident gross lesions were observed viral rna histopathological changes and viral nucleoprotein were observed in the lung trachea and sinus of all inoculated mice our study demonstrates the importance of elucidating the epidemiology of coronaviruses including in rodents that are pests in poultry production coronaviruses are a large family of viruses belonging to the order nidovirales family coronaviridae recently the discovery of novel coronaviruses resulted in the division of
genome-wide association studies have indicated that human leukocyte antigen hla-dp and hla-dq play roles in persistent hepatitis b virus hbv infection in asia to understand the evolution of hbv-related single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and to correlate these snps with chronic hbv infection among different populations we conducted a global perspective study on hepatitis-related snps we selected 12 hbv-related snps on the hla locus and two hbv and three hepatitis c virus immune-related snps for analysis five nasopharyngeal carcinoma-related snps served as controls all snp data worldwide from 26 populations were downloaded from 1000 genomes we found a dramatic difference in the allele frequency in most of the hbv-and hla-related snps in east asia compared to the other continents a sharp change in allele frequency in 8 of 12 snps was found between bengali populations in bangladesh and chinese dai populations in xishuangbanna china p < 0.001 these areas represent the junction of south and east asia for the immune-related snps significant changes were found after leaving africa most of these genes shifted from higher expression genotypes in africa to lower expression genotypes in either europe or south asia p < 0.001 during this two-stage adaptation immunity adjusted toward a weak immune response which could have been a survival strategy during human migration to east asia the prevalence of chronic hbv infection in africa is as high as in asia however the hbv-related snp genotypes are not present in africa and so the genetic mechanism of chronic hbv infection in africa needs further exploration conclusion two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response occurred when humans migrated out of africa these changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments
the microneutralization mn assay is a standard and important technique in virology immunology and epidemiology it is a highly specific and sensitive assay for evaluating virus-specific neutralizing antibodies nabs in human and animal sera it provides the most precise answer to whether or not an individual or animal has antibodies that can neutralize or inhibit the infectivity of a specific virus strain however using live virus-based mn assay might require working under high containment facilities especially when dealing with high-risk pathogens such as the middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov in this chapter we describe the isolation amplification and titration of mers-cov as well as detailed mn assay to measure nab levels in sera from different mammalian species
in 1972 a 27-nm virus-like particle was discovered by use of immune electron microscopy iem in an infectious stool filtrate derived from an outbreak of gastroenteritis in an elementary school in norwalk ohio iem enabled the direct visualization of antigen-antibody interaction as the particles were aggregated and coated by specific antibodies this allowed the recognition and identification of a 27-nm virus-like particle that did not have a distinctive morphology was low-titered and was among the smallest viruses known serum antibody responses to the 27-nm particle were demonstrated in key individuals infected under natural or experimental conditions this and other evidence suggested that this virus-like particle was the etiologic agent of the norwalk gastroenteritis outbreak the fastidious 27-nm norwalk virus is now considered to be the prototype strain of a group of noncultivatable viruses that are important etiologic agents of epidemic gastroenteritis in adults and older children i was invited to present my reflections on the discovery of the norwalk virus this is a personal odyssey that chronicles the steps in making the arduous leap from the discovery of a 27-nm virus-like particle to its etiologic association with epidemic gastroenteritis i will describe how by necessity we bypassed the classical tissue-culture virology approach which relies on the ability of a virus to infect and produce a change in cells or to infect an animal model rather we used a novel approach-"direct virology" or "particle virology"-in which the virus particle itself is studied directly as the "center of attention" without the benefit of an in vitro or animal model system the goals of the laboratory of infectious diseases lid at the national institutes of health nih traditionally have focused on the definition of the natural history and epidemiologic characteristics of a disease the elucidation of its etiologic agent and the development of a vaccine for its prevention with the termination in 1969 of the longitudinal junior village study of infants and young children which for 15 years had encompassed each of these goals the emphasis of the epidemiology section of the lid turned to the study of the etiology of acute all volunteers gave informed consent human experimentation guidelines of the us department of health and human services were followed in the conduct of the clinical research
influenza virus iv infections represent a very serious public health problem at present no established biomarkers exist to support diagnosis for respiratory viral infections and more importantly for severe iv disease studies in animal models are extremely important to understand the biological genetic and environmental factors that contribute to severe iv disease and to validate biomarker candidates from human studies however mouse human cross-species comparisons are often compromised by the fact that animal studies concentrate on the infected lungs whereas in humans almost all studies use peripheral blood from patients in addition human studies do not consider genetic background as variable although human populations are genetically very diverse therefore in this study we performed a cross-species gene expression study of the peripheral blood from human patients and from the highly genetically diverse collaborative cross cc mouse population after iv infection our results demonstrate that changes of gene expression in individual genes are highly similar in mice and humans the top-regulated genes in humans were also differentially regulated in mice we conclude that the mouse is a highly valuable in vivo model system to validate and to discover gene candidates which can be used as biomarkers in humans furthermore mouse studies allow confirmation of findings in humans in a well-controlled experimental system adding enormous value to the understanding of expression and function of human candidate genes
a r t i c l e i n f ocrimean-congo hemorrhagic fever computer-aided vaccine design multi-epitope vaccine a b s t r a c t crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is considered one of the major public health concerns with case fatality rates of up to 80%. currently there is no effective approved vaccine for cchf in this study we used a computer-aided vaccine design approach to develop the first multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for cchf for this purpose linear b-cell and t-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of cchf virus including gc and gn were predicted the epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity allergenicity hydrophobicity stability toxicity and population coverage a total number of seven epitopes including five t-cell and two b-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear b-cell t-cell epitopes and cholera toxin b-subunit ctxb along with heat labile enterotoxin iic b subunit lt-iic as adjuvants all the segments were joined using appropriate linkers the physicochemical properties as well as the presence of ifn-γ inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine was also checked to determining the vaccine stability solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses the 3d structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational b-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with mhc-i and ii molecules furthermore molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-mhcs complexes stability during stimulation time the results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable well soluble in water and potentially antigenic results also demonstrated that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and could serve as a promising anti-cchf vaccine candidate
infectious bronchitis ib is a highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens caused by infectious bronchitis virus ibv this disease is of considerable economic importance and is primarily controlled through biosecurity and immunization with live attenuated and inactivated ib vaccines of various serotypes in the present study we tested the safety and efficacy of an attenuated predominant chinese qx-like ibv strain the results revealed that the attenuated strain has a clear decrease in pathogenicity for specific-pathogen-free spf chickens compared with the parent strain strain yninoculated birds had clinical signs of varying severity with 30% mortality while the attenuated group appeared healthy with less tissue damage the attenuated strain also had relatively low tissue replication rates and higher antibody levels the superior protective efficacy of the attenuated strain was observed when vaccinated birds were challenged with a homologous or heterologous field ibv strain indicating the potential of the attenuated yn ayn as a vaccine producing a vaccine targeting the abundant serotype in china is essential to reducing the economic impact of ib on the poultry industry
background group a rotaviruses rva are the main cause of neonatal calve diarrhea ncd in morocco in this study we isolated rva strains from ncd clinical samples in order to support rva disease control in morocco this isolation process constitutes a first step toward vaccine development methods thirteen fecal samples were obtained from calves with a single episode of neonate calf diarrhea at three different dairies and two samples were collected from field during a severe ncd outbreak diagnosis of rva infection was based on fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test and further evaluated for their hemagglutination ha activity rva isolation was carried out on ma104 cells after inoculates were treated with different concentrations of trypsin tpck all rva isolates were confirmed by lsi vetmax ™ triplex ruminant rotavirus & coronavirus real-time pcr kit g and p typing were determined by direct sequencing of the vp4 and vp7 amplicons results rva isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages 60 % and was properly depended on ha activity and trypsin treatment of inoculates the first sign of cpe detected consisted of increased cell granularity obscure cell boundaries cell rounding and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells at lower tpck concentration 3-10 μg/inoculum no changes at the cellular level were observed while cells activated with 25-30 μg of trypsin/inoculums they degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced appreciable changes in cell's morphology were detected with optimal trypsin concentration of 15-20 μg trypsin/inoculums data from qrt-pcr confirmed that unsuccessful cultivations have no-ct and all nine isolates have ct values ranged between 12.17 and 24.69 analysis sequencing revealed that field isolates were of g6 p serotype and isolates from the dairy ncd samples were of g10 p serotype to our knowledge this is the first study in morocco which reports the circulation of g10p in ncd on dairy farms and g6p in the field our study constitutes a crucial and a necessary step allowing preventive and veterinary medicine to support rva disease controls in the country
background pigs are well known source of human infectious disease to better understand the spectrum of viruses present in pigs we utilized the 454 life sciences gs-flx high-throughput sequencing platform to sequence stool samples from healthy pigs findings total nucleic acid was extracted from stool samples of healthy piglets and randomly amplified the amplified materials were pooled and processed using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique the raw sequences were deconvoluted on the basis of the barcode and then processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline the unique reads 348 70 and 13 had limited similarity to known astroviruses bocaviruses and parechoviruses specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of the viruses in healthy piglets our results indicate extremely high rates of positivity conclusions several novel astroviruses bocaviruses and ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs the rates of isolation for the new viruses were high the high detection rate diverse sequences and categories indicate that pigs are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of different enteric viruses
vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions of the 20th century all vaccines can be classified into different types such as vaccines against infectious diseases anticancer vaccines and vaccines against autoimmune diseases in recent decades recombinant technologies have enabled the design of experimental vaccines against a wide range of diseases using plant viruses and virus-like particles as central elements to stimulate protective and long-lasting immune responses the analysis of recent publications shows that at least 97 experimental vaccines have been constructed based on plant viruses including 71 vaccines against infectious agents 16 anticancer vaccines and 10 therapeutic vaccines against autoimmune disorders several plant viruses have already been used for the development of vaccine platforms and have been tested in human and veterinary studies suggesting that plant virus-based vaccines will be introduced into clinical and veterinary practice in the near future
although not widely studied behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction r o of the pathogen the most notable example is rabies when a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression the virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated toxoplasmosis is another example when mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats thus increasing their chances of being eaten toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans e g through cat feces has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period thus producing an obvious vector for transmission here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 which produces the covid-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans
serum and csf specimens from clinically healthy brown norway bn rats inoculated intracerebrally with corona virus jhm were analysed with respect to the state of the blood-brain barrier bbb and the intrathecal synthesis and isoelectric distribution of immunoglobulins ig increased csf/serum ratios for ig in the context of an intact bbb were never seen in the absence of intrathecal synthesis of virus-specific antibodies affinity-mediated immunoblot analysis revealed a broad pattern of virus-specific antibodies with embedded clusters of restricted heterogeneity but no signs of oligoclonal ig production carrying non-viral specificity from these data it was concluded that bn rats do control the intracerebral spread of jhm virus effectively by a strong local virus-specific antibody response thereby preventing a clinically apparent disease
the biological function of bovine colostral immunoglobulins is to provide the newborn calf with adequate passive immune protection against microbial infections immunoglobulin preparations designed for farm animals are commercially available and some colostrumbased products are marketed also for humans as dietary supplements the concentration of specific antibodies against a certain pathogenic microorganism can be raised in colostrum and milk by immunizing cows with this pathogen or its antigen advances in bioseparation and chromatographic techniques have made it possible to fractionate and enrich these antibodies and formulate so-called hyperimmune colostral or milk preparations their efficacy in prevention and treatment of various microbial infections has been evaluated in numerous studies immune milk preparations have proven effective in prophylaxis against infections caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens their therapeutic efficacy however seems more limited a few commercial immune milk products are already on market and more applications can be expected in the coming years this article reviews the recent progress made in isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins and the application of colostral and immune milk preparations in fighting various microbial infectious diseases in humans r
vaccination is the process of administering immunogenic formulations in order to induce or harness antigen ag-specific antibody and t cell responses in order to protect against infections important successes have been obtained in protecting individuals against many deleterious pathological situations after parenteral vaccination however one of the major limitations of the current vaccination strategies is the administration route that may not be optimal for the induction of immunity at the site of pathogen entry i e mucosal surfaces it is now well documented that immune responses along the genital respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts have to be elicited locally to ensure efficient trafficking of effector and memory b and t cells to mucosal tissues moreover needle-free mucosal delivery of vaccines is advantageous in terms of safety compliance and ease of administration however the quest for mucosal vaccines is challenging due to 1 the fact that ag sampling has to be performed across the epithelium through a relatively limited number of portals of entry 2 the deleterious acidic and proteolytic environment of the mucosae that affect the stability integrity and retention time of the applied ags and 3 the tolerogenic environment of mucosae which requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit efficient effector immune responses until now only few mucosally applicable vaccine formulations have been developed and successfully tested in animal models and clinical trials the use of lipidic structures such as liposomes virosomes immune stimulating complexes gas-filled microbubbles and emulsions has proven efficient for the mucosal delivery of associated ags and the induction of local and systemic immune reponses such particles are suitable for mucosal delivery because they protect the associated payload from degradation and deliver concentrated amounts of ags via specialized sampling cells microfold cells within the mucosal epithelium to underlying antigen-presenting cells the review aims at summarizing recent development in the field of mucosal vaccination using lipid-based particles the modularity ensured by tailoring the lipidic design and content of particles and their known safety as already established in humans make the continuing appraisal of these vaccine candidates a promising development in the field of targeted mucosal vaccination
the complete genome sequence was determined for avian paramyxovirus apmv-6 serotype 6 strain teal/ chany/455/2009 isolated from a teal anas crecca in siberia siberia is crossed by four major migration flyways and represents the major breeding area for many wild bird species in the palearctic strain teal/chany/455/2009 is genetically closely related to kazakh and chinese strains and belongs to the genetic group of duck/hong kong/18/ 199/77-like apmv-6 viruses we show that the virus has low pathogenic potential according to genetic markers and animal model experiments
the interaction of bacteria and virus has been well demonstrated in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease in swine the interaction between porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus prrsv and haemophilus parusuis has not been studied we initiated studies to evaluate a possible effect of the prrsv on the pathogenesis of polyserositis caused by h parusuis a group of 30 three week old piglets were distributed in 4 groups group i 10 pigs was inoculated with prrsv and h parusuis group ii 10 pigs was inoculated with h parusuis alone group iii 5 pigs was inoculated with virus alone and group iv 5 pigs was inoculated with culture media lesions consisted of a severe fibrinous polyserositis affecting 7 of 10 animals in group ii and a mild fibrinous pleuritis in 1 of io animals of group i three of ten animals dually infected with the two agents died during the course of the study these animals had pulmonary congestion and focal lung hemorrhages no other animals died from other groups group iii and iv had no macroscopic lesions microscopically group iii had interstitial pneumonia immunomodulating virus effect may explain the differences in terms of lesions severity between groups i and ii septic shock was suspected as cause of sudden death 0 1997 elsevier science b v
post-weaning diarrhea pwd is one of the most serious threats for the swine industry worldwide it is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli in the pig intestine colistin a cationic antibiotic is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of intestinal infections caused by e coli and particularly of pwd however despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of pwd several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant e coli in swine furthermore this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant mdr gram-negative bacteria gnb moreover the recent discovery of the mcr-1 gene encoding for colistin resistance in enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of mdr-gnb in humans consequently it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only thus to overcome the economic losses which would result from the restriction of use of colistin especially for prophylactic purposes in pwd control we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of pwd in swine is crucial such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance the present review begins with an overview of risk factors of pwd and an update of colistin use in pwd control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes subsequently alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed finally a practical approach for the control of pwd in its various phases is proposed
ecological speciation hypotheses claim that assortative mating evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection for ecologically important traits reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat we tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an rna virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host we subjected four populations of the rna bacteriophage 6 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts in the most extreme case one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild-type 6 whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change highlighting the ease with which an emerging rna virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations furthermore our data confirm the biological credibility of simple "no-gene" mechanisms of assortative mating in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation
background the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies mabs that neutralize a broad spectrum of primary hiv-1 isolates and the characterization of the human neutralizing antibody b cell response to hiv-1 infection are important goals that are central to the design of an effective antibody-based vaccine methods and findings we immortalized igg + memory b cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of hiv-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins env in multiple parallel assays we isolated 58 mabs that were mapped to different env surfaces most of which showed neutralizing activity one mab in particular hj16 specific for a novel epitope proximal to the cd4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of tier-2 hiv-1 pseudoviruses and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth but distinct in neutralization specificity to that of the other cd4 binding site-specific neutralizing mab b12 a second mab hgn194 bound a conserved epitope in the v3 crown and neutralized all tier-1 and a proportion of tier-2 pseudoviruses tested irrespective of clade a third mab hk20 with broad neutralizing activity particularly as a fab fragment recognized a highly conserved epitope in the hr-1 region of gp41 but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity conclusions this study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods a large proportion of memory b cells can be isolated that produce mabs with hiv-1 neutralizing activity three of these mabs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of hiv-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and templatebased vaccine design

recombinant foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv proteins 3a 3b and 3ab were produced by expressing the corresponding genes in escherichia coli and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography the recombinant proteins were used as antigens in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa to differentiate between vaccinated and fmd-infected animals the following parameters were determined working concentrations of antigens and peroxidase conjugate of cattle anti-igg the optimum composition of blocking buffer and the positive-negative threshold of the reaction tests performed with approximately 200 serum samples taken from animals of different immunity states showed that the protocol with protein 3a as the antigen 3a-elisa provided the most reliable differentiation all the newly developed systems proved to outperform the commercial chekit fmd-3abc kit in sensitivity and 3a-elisa was no less specific
background betaretroviruses infect a wide range of species including primates rodents ruminants and marsupials they exist in both endogenous and exogenous forms and are implicated in animal diseases such as lung cancer in sheep and in human disease with members of the human endogenous retrovirus-k herv-k group of endogenous betaretroviruses βervs associated with human cancers and autoimmune diseases to improve our understanding of betaretroviruses in an evolutionarily distinct host species we characterized βervs present in the genomes and transcriptomes of mega-and microbats which are an important reservoir of emerging viruses results a diverse range of full-length βervs were discovered in mega-and microbat genomes and transcriptomes including the first identified intact endogenous retrovirus in a bat our analysis revealed that the genus betaretrovirus can be divided into eight distinct sub-groups with evidence of cross-species transmission betaretroviruses are revealed to be a complex retrovirus group within which one sub-group has evolved from complex to simple genomic organization through the acquisition of an env gene from the genus gammaretrovirus molecular dating suggests that bats have contended with betaretroviral infections for over 30 million years conclusions our study reveals that a diverse range of betaretroviruses have circulated in bats for most of their evolutionary history and cluster with extant betaretroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages suggesting that their distribution may be largely unrestricted by host species barriers the presence of βervs with the ability to transcribe active viral elements in a major animal reservoir for viral pathogens has potential implications for public health
rabies in wildlife has been successfully controlled in parts of europe and north america using oral rabies vaccination i e the distribution of baits containing live-attenuated virus strains occasionally these vaccines caused vaccine virus-induced rabies cases to elucidate the mechanisms of genetic selection and the effect of viral populations on these rabies cases a next generation sequencing approach as well as comprehensive data analyses of the genetic diversity of street alabama dufferin sad and era vaccine virus strains and vaccine-induced rabies cases from canada and several european countries were conducted as a result twelve newly generated sets of sequencing data from canada and poland were added to a pool of previously investigated samples while the population-based analysis showed a segregation of viruses of era vaccine-induced rabies cases from those of sad bern original sad bern orig -derived rabies cases the in-depth variant analysis revealed three distinct combinations of selected variants for the era vaccine-induced cases suggesting the presence of multiple replication-competent haplotypes in the investigated era-bhk21 vaccine our findings demonstrate the potential of a deep sequencing approach in combination with comprehensive analyses on the consensus population and variant level
vaccines are one of the miracles of modern medicine without vaccines the population-particularly children-would be troubled with multitudinous infectious diseases such as diphtheria scarlet fever whooping cough and measles just to name a few vaccines are available against both viral and bacterial infections they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so the world health organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a year old against most infectious diseases by 2020 the history of the public's acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one anti-vaccination movements have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the present an example of this is the fabricated information spread about the relationship between measles vaccine and autism a successful polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups led by koprowski salk and sabin although each of these vaccines has its advantages and disadvantages an oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration and a herd effect polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in nigeria and pakistan recently recombinant dna technology was used to develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects since live virus is not involved the future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution
bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re-emerging viruses many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats the ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals towards a better understanding of the bat immune system we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable vh regions of antibodies from the black flying fox pteropus alecto the germline repertoire of the closely related pteropid bat pteropus vampyrus whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes representative vh genes were found in all three mammalian vh clans i ii and iii in both the expressed p alecto vh repertoire and the germline p vampyrus vh repertoire evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity dh and joining jh segments for the generation of diverse vdj rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of p alecto the long period of co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific vh segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens
simple summary in this study we isolated and characterized potential probiotic bifidobacteria from sow milk the bifidobacterial population in milk has been attributed to the existence of prebiotic oat in feeding systems since breast feeding protects the newborns against several infectious diseases milk from sows fed with oat could improve the health of piglets the objectives of this study were to i investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and ii evaluate their probiotic potential in this study we investigated the effects of supplementing sows' gestation and lactation feed with 15% oat prebiotic source on the levels of probiotic population in milk we found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties and acid-and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid ph 2.5 and bile salts 0% 0.25% 0.50% 1.0% and 2.0%. all isolates survived under the condition of low ph and bile 2.0%. autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5% to 73%. these isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against e coli o157h7 together our results suggest that inclusion of oat in feeding systems could have the potential to improve the intestinal health of piglets by increasing the population of bifidobacteria animals 2015 5 611

in the last half century significant attention has been given to animal diseases however our understanding of disease processes and how to manage them at the livestock-wildlife interface remains limited in this study we conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the status of diseases at the livestock-wildlife interface in the united states specifically the goals of the literature review were three fold first to evaluate domestic animal diseases currently found in the united states where wildlife may play a role second to identify critical issues faced in managing these diseases at the livestock-wildlife interface and third to identify potential technical and policy strategies for addressing these issues we found that of the 86 avian ruminant swine poultry and lagomorph diseases that are reportable to the world organization for animal health oie 53 are present in the united states 42 79% of these have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission maintenance or life cycle of the pathogen and 21 40% are known to be zoonotic at least six of these reportable diseases-bovine tuberculosis paratuberculosis brucellosis avian influenza rabies and cattle fever tick vector control-have a wildlife reservoir that is a recognized impediment to eradication in domestic populations the complex nature of these systems highlights the need to understand the role of wildlife in the epidemiology transmission and maintenance of infectious diseases of livestock successful management or eradication of these diseases will require the development of cross-discipline and institutional collaborations despite social and policy challenges there remain opportunities to develop new collaborations and new technologies to mitigate the risks posed at the livestock-wildlife interface published by elsevier b v
the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 viruses especially the laboratory-generated h5n1 mutants have demonstrated the potential to cross the species barrier and infect mammals and humans consequently the design of an effective and safe anti-h5n1 vaccine is essential we previously demonstrated that the full-length hemagglutinin 1 ha1 could induce significant neutralizing antibody response and protection here we intended to identify the critical neutralizing domain cnd in an optimal conformation that can elicit strong cross-neutralizing antibodies and protection against divergent h5n1 strains we thus constructed six recombinant proteins covering different regions of ha1 of a/anhui/ 1/2005h5n1 each of which was fused with foldon fd and fc of human igg we found that the critical fragment fused with fd/fc ha-13-263-fdc h5 numbering that could elicit the strongest neutralizing antibody response is located in the n-terminal region of ha1 residues 13-263 which covers the receptor-binding domain rbd residues 112-263 we then constructed three additional recombinants fused with fd plus his tag ha-13-263-fd-his fc only ha-13-263-fc and his tag only ha-13-263-his respectively we found that the ha-13-263-fdc which formed an oligomeric conformation induced the strongest neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against challenges of two tested h5n1 virus strains covering clade 1 a/vietnam/1194/2004 vn/1194 or clade 2.3.4 a/shenzhen/406h/06 sz/406h while ha-13-263-fc dimer and ha-13-263-fd-his trimer elicited higher neutralizing antibody response and protection than ha-13-263-his monomer these results suggest that the oligomeric form of the cnd containing the rbd can be further developed as an effective and safe vaccine for cross-protection against divergent strains of h5n1 viruses
lactobacillus casei strain shirota was selected as a bacterial carrier for the development of live mucosal vaccines against coronavirus a 75 kda fragment of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev spike glycoprotein s was used as the model coronavirus antigen the s glycoprotein was cloned into a lactobacillus/e coli shuttle vector plp500 where expression and secretion of the glycoprotein s from the recombinant lactobacilli was detected via immunoblotting oral immunization of balb/c mice with recombinant lcs that constitutively expresses the 75 kda fragment of the glycoprotein s induced both local mucosal and systemic immune responses against tgev maximum titers of igg 8.38 ± 0.19 ng/ml of serum and iga 64.82 ± 2.9 ng/ml of intestinal water were attained 32 days post oral inturbation the induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on tgev infection
there exists experimental evidence that necrotoxigenic escherichia coli ntec strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 1 cause intestinal and extra-intestinal disease in piglets on the other hand no experimental model has been developed with ntec strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 2 in all 14 colostrum-restricted calves were orally challenged with two strains isolated from the faeces of a diarrheic calf b20a or from the heart blood of a septicaemic calf 1404 all calves had diarrhoea which lasted until euthanasia in eight of them in those calves diarrhoea was correlated with the faecal excretion of the challenge strains at necropsy vascular congestion of the intestinal mucosa hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes mln and some congestion of the lungs were observed bacteriology confirmed the colonisation of the intestine by the challenge strains which were also recovered from the heart blood the lungs and/or the liver histological sections confirmed enterocolitis lymphadenitis and limited bronchopneumonia in the intestinal tissue sections bacteria testing positive in an in situ dna hybridisation assay with a cnf2 probe were observed those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-o78 and a monoclonal anti-f17b antisera three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a cnf à f17a strain 25kh09 had no clinical signs or lesions the other two presented a profuse liquid diarrhoea but those calves were positive for the presence of k99 þ e coli in this model both ntec2 strains were thus able to colonise the intestine to cause long-lasting diarrhoea and to invade the blood stream with localisation in various internal organs in colostrumrestricted conventional newborn calves #
canine coronavirus ccov is one of the most important viral agents affecting the gastrointestinal system of dogs in this study virological and serological investigations were performed to demonstrate the existence and prevalence of ccov infection in a turkish dog population a total of 269 animals were subjected to the study of 179 dogs tested for ccov antibodies 112 62.5% were found to be positive by serum neutralization test while 133 74.3% were positive by elisa the highest prevalence 94.2% was detected in kennel dogs detection of ccov genome in faeces was performed in samples from 90 diarrhoeic puppies by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction fourteen 15.5% faeces were positive for ccov rna five of which were characterized as ccov type i the widespread ccov infection in the turkish dog population may be attributed as an important cause of viral diarrhoea in dogs
the majority of emerging zoonoses originate in wildlife and many are caused by viruses however there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity here termed "virodiversity" for any wildlife species despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses in this case study we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens the indian flying fox pteropus giganteus and used pcr with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families we then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in p giganteus to be 58 viruses our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host we used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses with minimal turnover between host species we estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be~$6.3 billion or~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses importance recent years have seen a dramatic increase in viral discovery efforts however most lack rigorous systematic design which limits our ability to understand viral diversity and its ecological drivers and reduces their value to public health intervention here we present a new framework for the discovery of novel viruses in wildlife and use it to make the first-ever estimate of the number of viruses that exist in a mammalian host as pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife this estimate allows us to put preliminary bounds around the potential size of the total zoonotic pool and facilitates a better understanding of where best to allocate resources for the subsequent discovery of global viral diversity lipkin wi 2013 . a strategy to estimate unknown viral diversity in mammals mbio 45 e00598-13
infectious bronchitis virus ibv infection has been a major threat to the poultry industry worldwide current commercially available elisa kits detect group-specific antibodies however to understand the status of field infection a monoclonal antibody mab blocking elisa b-elisa against local ibvs was developed the selected mab showed specificity to taiwan ibv strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain h120 using the hemagglutination inhibition hi test as a standard the cut-off value sensitivity and specificity of a b-elisa using this mab were evaluated in 390 field samples the typespecificity of detection was validated using a panel of chicken hyperimmune sera the results showed that the b-elisa demonstrated high sensitivity 98.0% and specificity 97.2% of detection the agreement between the results of the b-elisa and the hi test was statistically significant kappa = 0.95 and there was no significant difference between these two methods mcnemar p = 0.72 the b-elisa specifically detected taiwan ibv serotypes but not three non-taiwan ibv serotypes nor sera against other avian pathogens this b-elisa provides type-specific antibody detection of local ibv strains it has the potential to serve as a rapid and reliable diagnostic method for ibv clinical infections in the field in taiwan
iceland is free of the major infectious diseases of horses however in 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease of unknown cause spread through the country's native horse population of 77000 microbiological investigations ruled out known viral agents but identified the opportunistic pathogen streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus s zooepidemicus in diseased animals we sequenced the genomes of 257 isolates of s zooepidemicus to differentiate epidemic from endemic strains we found that although multiple endemic clones of s zooepidemicus were present one particular clone sequence type 209 st209 was likely to have been responsible for the epidemic concurrent with the epidemic st209 was also recovered from a human case of septicemia highlighting the pathogenic potential of this strain epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into one training yard during february 2010 provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses that then transmitted the strain to farms throughout iceland this study represents the first time that whole-genome sequencing has been used to investigate an epidemic on a national scale to identify the likely causative agent and the link to an associated zoonotic infection our data highlight the importance of national biosecurity to protect vulnerable populations of animals and also demonstrate the potential impact of s zooepidemicus transmission to other animals including humans importance an epidemic of respiratory disease affected almost the entire native icelandic horse population of 77000 animals in 2010 resulting in a self-imposed ban on the export of horses and significant economic costs to associated industries although the speed of transmission suggested that a viral pathogen was responsible only the presence of the opportunistic pathogen streptococcus zooepidemicus was consistent with the observed clinical signs we applied genomic sequencing to differentiate epidemic from endemic strains and to shed light on the rapid transmission of the epidemic strain throughout iceland we further highlight the ability of epidemic and endemic strains of s zooepidemicus to infect other animals including humans this study represents the first time that whole-genome sequencing has been used to elucidate an outbreak on a national scale and identify the likely causative agent
simple summary porcine epidemic diarrhea is one of the major problems in current swine husbandry worldwide and effective measures for prevention and treatment are scarce we found that high dose 25-hydroxyvitamin d 3 supplementation could ease intestinal injury and inhibit intestinal immune response induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv suggesting that feeding a high dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin d 3 could be used as an approach against pedv infection we conducted this experiment to determine if feeding 25-hydroxyvitamin d 3 25ohd 3 to weaned pigs would alleviate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection and immune response forty-two weaned pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary 25ohd 3 treatments 5.5 5.5 43.0 80.5 118.0 155.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg diet for 26 days on day 22 of the trial all the treatments were orally administrated with pedv except for one of the 5.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg treatments which was challenged with the same volume of sterile saline and served as control another 5.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg group for pedv challenge was named con-pedv average daily gain p < 0.05 was reduced by pedv infection pedv administration also induced severe diarrhea p < 0.05 reduction of villous height and the ratio of villous height to crypt depth and increase of crypt depth and serum diamine oxidase activity p < 0.05 serum igm and complement component 4 levels were increased by pedv challenge however 155.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg supplementation alleviated intestinal damage p < 0.05 compared with con-pedv furthermore 155.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg supplementation downregulated the mrna abundance of inflammatory cytokines and interferon signal pathway-related genes p < 0.05 compared with con-pedv these results suggested that dietary supplementation of 155.5 µg 25ohd 3 /kg could alleviate intestinal damage and protect against pedv-induced inflammatory status
the henipaviruses represented by hendra hev and nipah niv viruses are highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses with uniquely broad host tropisms responsible for repeated outbreaks in australia southeast asia india and bangladesh the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with infection and lack of licensed antiviral therapies make the henipaviruses a potential biological threat to humans and livestock henipavirus entry is initiated by the attachment of the g envelope glycoprotein to host cell membrane receptors previously henipavirus-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies hmab have been isolated using the hev-g glycoprotein and a human naïve antibody library one cross-reactive and receptor-blocking hmab m102.4 was recently demonstrated to be an effective post-exposure therapy in two animal models of niv and hev infection has been used in several people on a compassionate use basis and is currently in development for use in humans here we report the crystal structure of the complex of hev-g with m102.3 an m102.4 derivative and describe niv and hev escape mutants this structure provides detailed insight into the mechanism of hev and niv neutralization by m102.4 and serves as a blueprint for further optimization of m102.4 as a therapeutic agent and for the development of entry inhibitors and vaccines
burkholderia pseudomallei the etiologic agent of melioidosis is a saprophytic bacterium readily isolated from wet soils of countries bordering the equator burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted clone of b pseudomallei that does not persist outside of its equine reservoir and causes the zoonosis glanders which is endemic in asia africa the middle east and south america infection by these organisms typically occurs via percutaneous inoculation or inhalation of aerosols and the most common manifestation is severe pneumonia leading to fatal bacteremia glanders and melioidosis are difficult to diagnose and require prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success rates there are no vaccines available to protect against either burkholderia species and there is concern regarding their use as biological warfare agents given that b mallei has previously been utilized in this manner hence experiments were performed to establish a mouse model of aerosol infection to study the organisms and develop countermeasures using a hand-held aerosolizer balb/c mice were inoculated intratracheally with strains b
in felids feline leukemia virus felv infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive virus readily eliminated and never detectable to progressive infection persistent viremia and viral shedding recently a novel outcome was postulated for low felv infectious doses naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted indicating infection but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood felv provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression to investigate the impact of low felv doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses blood p27 proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection tissue proviral loads were determined as well the immune response was monitored by measuring felv whole virus and p45 antibodies and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen focma assay one cat showed regressive infection transient antigenemia persistent provirus-positivity and seroconversion with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice in 7 of the 20 remaining cats focma assay positivity was the only sign of infection while all other tests were negative overall the results show that felv low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection therefore commonly used detection methods do not detect all felv-infected animals possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection felv / pathogenesis / infection outcome / abortive infection / focma assay
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv a member of the group of alphacoronaviruses is the pathogen of a highly contagious gastrointestinal swine disease the elucidation of the events associated with the intestinal epithelial response to pedv infection has been limited by the absence of good in vitro porcine intestinal models that recapitulate the multicellular complexity of the gastrointestinal tract here we generated swine enteroids from the intestinal crypt stem cells of the duodenum jejunum or ileum and found that the generated enteroids are able to satisfactorily recapitulate the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo and are susceptible to infection by pedv pedv infected multiple types of cells including enterocytes stem cells and goblet cells and exhibited segmental infection discrepancies compared with ileal enteroids and colonoids and this finding was verified in vivo moreover the clinical isolate pedv-jms propagated better in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted isolate pedv-cv777 and pedv infection suppressed interferon ifn production early during the infection course ifn lambda elicited a potent antiviral response and inhibited pedv in enteroids more efficiently than ifn alpha ifn-␣. therefore swine enteroids provide a novel in vitro model for exploring the pathogenesis of pedv and for the in vitro study of the interplay between a host and a variety of swine enteric viruses importance pedv is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that causes significant economic losses and the lack of a good in vitro model system is a major roadblock to an in-depth understanding of pedv pathogenesis here we generated a porcine intestinal enteroid model for pedv infection utilizing porcine intestinal enteroids we demonstrated that pedv infects multiple lineages of the intestinal epithelium and preferably infects ileal enteroids over colonoids and that enteroids prefer to respond to ifn lambda 1 over ifn-␣. these events recapitulate the events that occur in vivo this study constitutes the first use of a primary intestinal enteroid model to investigate the susceptibility of porcine enteroids to pedv and to determine the antiviral response following infection our study provides important insights into the events associated with pedv infection of the porcine intestine and provides a valuable in vitro model for studying not only pedv but also other swine enteric viruses
infectious disease epidemics match wars and natural disasters in their capacity to threaten lives and damage economies like sars previously and zika recently the ebola crisis in 2015 showed how vulnerable the world is to these epidemics with over 11000 people dying in the outbreak in addition to causing immense human suffering these epidemics particularly affect low-and middle-income countries many of these deadly infectious diseases that have epidemic potential can become global health emergencies in the absence of effective vaccines but very few vaccines against these threats have been developed to create proven medical products the measles vaccine is an efficient live attenuated replicating virus that has been safely administered to 2 billion children over the last 40 years affording life-long protection after a single dose taking advantage of these characteristics this attenuated virus was transformed into a versatile chimeric or recombinant vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-ofprinciple in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens clinical trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine platform in individuals with preexisting immunity to measles this review describes the potential of this platform to develop new vaccines against emerging viral diseases
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov is a newly emerging virus that causes sars with high mortality rate in infected people to study the humoral responses against sars-cov we evaluated nucleocapsid n and spike s proteins-specific antibodies in patients' sera by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa recombinant n and s proteins of sars-cov were purified from transformed e coli serum specimens from 40 sars-cov-infected patients in the convalescent phase were analyzed by western blotting using the purified antigens serial serum specimens from 12 rt-pcr-confirmed sars patients were assayed by elisa using the recombinant n protein as coated antigen by western blotting 97.5% of the sars patients were positive for n proteinspecific antibodies whereas only 47.5% of the samples were positive for s protein-specific antibodies using n protein-based elisa 10 out of the 12 patients were positive for n proteinspecific antibodies and 6 of them showed seroconversion at mean of 16 days after onset of fever immunoblotting was useful for detecting the humoral immune response after sars-cov infection antibodies against sars-cov n protein appear at the early stage of infection therefore n protein-based elisa could serve as a simple sensitive and specific test for diagnosing sars-cov infection
background in order to prevent spread of the endemic pathogens bovine coronavirus bcov and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv between herds knowledge of indirect transmission by personnel and fomites is fundamental the aims of the study were to determine the duration of viral rna carriage and the infectivity of viral particles on fomites and human nasal mucosa after exposure to bcov and brsv during two animal infection experiments swabs were collected from personnel nasal mucosa and their clothes boots and equipment after contact with calves shedding either virus viral rna was quantified by rt-qpcr or droplet digital rt-pcr rt-ddpcr and selected samples with high levels of viral rna were tested by cell culture for infectivity results for bcov 46% n = 80 of the swabs from human nasal mucosa collected 30 min after exposure were positive by rt-qpcr after two four and six hours 15% 5% and 0% of the swabs were positive respectively infective virions were not detected in mucosal swabs n = 2 a high viral rna load was detected on 97% n = 44 of the fomites 24 h after exposure and infective virions were detected in two of three swabs for brsv 35% n = 26 of the human nasal mucosa swabs collected 30 min after exposure were positive by rt-ddpcr but none were positive for infective virions of the fomites 89% n = 38 were positive for brsv rna 24 h after exposure but all were negative for infective viruses the results indicate that human nasal mucosa can carry both bcov and brsv rna after exposure to virus shedding calves but the carriage seems short-lived and the transmission potential is likely limited high viral loads on contaminates fomites 24 h after exposure to infected animals and detection of infective bcov indicate that contaminated fomites represent a significant risk for indirect transmission between herds
neonatal calf diarrhoea remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in preweaned dairy calves worldwide this complex disease can be triggered by both infectious and non-infectious causes the four most important enteropathogens leading to neonatal dairy calf diarrhoea are escherichia coli rota-and coronavirus and cryptosporidium parvum besides treating diarrhoeic neonatal dairy calves the veterinarian is the most obvious person to advise the dairy farmer on prevention and treatment of this disease this review deals with prevention and treatment of neonatal dairy calf diarrhoea focusing on the importance of a good colostrum management and a correct fluid therapy
the role of non-cytomegalovirus cmv enteric viral infection in causing diarrhoea in patients with human immunode®ciency virus hiv is poorly understood we aimed to investigate the prevalence of these infections in acute and chronic diarrhoea stool specimens from 377 hiv-infected patients presenting with diarrhoea were studied prospectively for evidence of non-cmv enteric viral infection patients with diarrhoea underwent investigation for gastrointestinal pathogens including electron microscopic examination of stool for enteric viruses we collected data on patients in whom enteric virus was identi®ed and examined the association of enteric virus infection with diarrhoeal symptomatology eighty-nine 10.3% stool specimens from 60 15.9% hiv + individuals were positive for coronavirus n = 13 22% rotavirus n = 11 18% adenovirus n = 30 50% and small round structured viruses n = 5 8% or dual infection n = 2 3%. thirty-four of 52 65% patients available for analysis had acute diarrhoea and 18/52 35% had chronic diarrhoea twentythree of 52 44% patients had a concurrent gut pathogen after exclusion of concurrent pathogens enteric viral infections were found to be signi®cantly associated with acute as opposed to chronic diarrhoea p = 0.004 the presence of adenovirus colitis was signi®cantly more likely to be associated with chronic diarrhoea 15/21 cases than adenovirus isolated from stool alone 9/23 cases p = 0.03 there was a trend towards an association between adenovirus colitis and colonic cytomegalovirus infection p = 0.06 enteric viral infection is strongly associated with acute diarrhoea in patients with hiv light microscopic examination of large bowel biopsies can identify adenovirus colitis which is signi®cantly associated with chronic diarrhoea and in addition may facilitate gastrointestinal coinfection with cmv

high consequence human pathogenic viruses must be handled at biosafety level 2 3 or 4 and must be rendered non-infectious before they can be utilized for molecular or immunological applications at lower biosafety levels here we evaluate psoralen-inactivated arena- bunya- corona- filo- flavi-and orthomyxoviruses for their suitability as antigen in immunological processes and as template for reverse transcription pcr and sequencing the method of virus inactivation using a psoralen molecule appears to have broad applicability to rna viruses and to leave both the particle and rna of the treated virus intact while rendering the virus non-infectious
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a serious infectious disease caused by the sars coronavirus we assessed the potential of prime-boost vaccination protocols based on the nucleocapsid nc protein co-administered with a derivative of the mucosal adjuvant malp-2 or expressed by modified vaccinia virus ankara mva-nc to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses at systemic and mucosal levels the obtained results demonstrated that strong immune responses can be elicited both at systemic and mucosal levels following a heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocol consisting in priming with nc protein add-mixed with malp-2 by intranasal route and boosting with mva-nc by intramuscular route

interferons ifns are a first line of defense against viral infection herein we describe the use of an adenovirus vectored mouse ifn alpha gene mdef201 as a prophylactic and treatment countermeasure in a sars-cov-infected balb/c mouse model complete survival protection was observed in mice given a single dose of mdef201 administered intranasally 1 3 5 7 or 14 days prior to lethal sars-cov challenge p < 0.001 and body weights of these treated mice were unaffected by the challenge in addition low doses of mdef201 protected lungs in a dose dependent manner as measured by a reduction in gross pathology intranasal treatment with mdef201 ranging from 10 6 to 10 8 pfu significantly protected mice against a lethal sars-cov infection in a dose dependent manner up to 12 h post infection p < 0.001 the data suggest that mdef201 is a new class of antiviral agent further development as treatment for sars-cov infections
adjuvant enhancing mucosal immune response is preferred in controlling many pathogens at the portal of entry earlier we reported that a toll-like-receptor 7 tlr7 agonist resiquimod r-848 stimulated the systemic immunity when adjuvanted with the inactivated newcastle disease virus vaccine in the chicken here we report the effect of r-848 when adjuvanted with live or inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv vaccines with special emphasis on mucosal immunity specific pathogen free spf chicks n = 60 were equally divided into six groups at two weeks of age and immunized with either inactivated or live ibv vaccine adjuvanted with or without r-848 groups that received either pbs or r-848 served as control a booster was given on 14 days postimmunization dpi r-848 enhanced the antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses when coadministered with the vaccines as evidenced by an increase in the antibody titre in elisa and stimulation index in lymphocyte transformation test ltt till 35 dpi and increased proportion of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells on 21 dpi in the flow cytometry interestingly it potentiated the iga responses in the tear and intestinal secretions when used with both live and inactivated ibv vaccines the combination of ibv vaccine with r-848 significantly up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 4 tgfβ4 transcripts in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs than that of the respective vaccine per se an enhanced secretory iga response is likely due to the up-regulation of tgfβ4 which is responsible for class switching to iga in conclusion co-administration of r-848 with inactivated or live ibv vaccine enhanced the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the chicken
canine cancer rates are similar to humans though the therapeutic options might be limited inducing a patient's own immune system to have an anti-tumor response is an attractive approach to cancer therapy in this safety study autologous tumor vaccines produced specifically for each canine patient were combined with advax™ a novel non-inflammatory immunomodulator and vaccine adjuvant and were tested for safety in a diverse range of patient presentations alone or in combination with other treatments canine patients had their tumor biopsied debulked or resected and the tumor antigens were processed into an autologous vaccine formulated with advax™ adjuvant with or without rhizavidin as an additional immune stimulant patients treated early in the trial received two intramuscular im doses 2 weeks apart as the study progressed and no issues of safety were observed the protocol was changed to weekly vaccinations for 4 weeks followed by monthly booster shots over the 150 i m injections delivered to date the vaccine was found to be very safe and no significant adverse reactions were observed these results justify ongoing development and future controlled studies of this autologous vaccine approach
clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves the organism and its toxins tcda and tcdb respectively were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive however toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates salmonella sp was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves but large numbers of e coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals prevalence rates for coronavirus and cryptosporidium sp were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic but rates of detection of rotavirus and giardia sp were more nearly equal between groups lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria large gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with c difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture toxins were found throughout the colon purified toxins a and b individually and conjointly caused comparable lesions as well as fluid accumulation in ligated intestinal loops our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others and add strength to a working hypothesis that c difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves it seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism #
infectious diarrhea is the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main pathogens associated with calf diarrhea although diarrhea is a symptom of infection with various pathogens investigations to detect the types of pathogens have never been performed in japan this study investigated the prevalence of four major diarrhea-causing pathogens in calves c parvum rotavirus coronavirus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli e coli k99 commercial immunochromatography testing of all four pathogens and molecular analysis of c parvum with diarrhea in calves from southernmost okinawa and northernmost hokkaido japan were conducted the frequencies of c parvum rotavirus coronavirus and e coli k99 in okinawa were 50% 28% 2.3% and 4.7% respectively watery fecal stools were significantly correlated with c parvum p b 0.05 in oocyst calculations for c parvum no significant difference was observed between the single-infection cases and the mixed-infection cases with rotavirus interestingly molecular analyses targeting small subunit ribosomal rna as well as glycoprotein 60 gp60 genes revealed that the c parvum nucleotide sequences from the two prefectures were identical indicating that c parvum with a uniform characteristic is distributed throughout japan gp60 subtyping analysis identified c parvum from okinawa and hokkaido as belonging to the iiaa15g2r1 subtype a known zoonotic subtype hence control of cryptosporidiosis is important not only for pre-weaned calves but also for human health
the world health organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of covid-27 19 which is caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 as pandemic there is 28 currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from sars-cov-2 29 infection one major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences 30 between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov we address this question by using plasma from 31 patients infected by sars-cov-2 or sars-cov and plasma obtained from infected or 32 immunized mice our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the 33 spike protein is common cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare indicating the 34 presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent 36 disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future overall this study not only 37 addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between 38 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov but also has important implications in vaccine 39 development.40
equine coronavirus ecov is considered an emerging enteric virus with reported morbidity rates ranging from 10 to 83% and fatality rates ranging from 7 to 27% in adult horses a vaccine for ecov is currently not available this study investigated the safety humoral response and viral shedding in horses inoculated with a commercially available modified-live bovine coronavirus bcov vaccine twelve healthy adult horses were vaccinated twice 3 weeks apart either orally intranasally or intrarectally two healthy unvaccinated horses served as sentinel controls following each vaccine administration horses were monitored daily for physical abnormalities whilst the onset and duration of bcov shedding was determined by quantitative pcr qpcr in nasal secretions and faeces whole blood was collected every 3 weeks to determine bcov-specific antibody response with the exception of transient and self-limiting changes in faecal character observed in seven vaccinated and one control horse no additional abnormal clinical findings were found in the study horses following the first and second vaccine administration two and one horse respectively tested qpcrpositive for bcov in nasal secretions 1-day post intranasal vaccination no vaccinated horses tested qpcr-positive for bcov in faeces following each vaccine administration one of the two horses that shed bcov seroconverted to bcov after the first vaccine administration and an additional two vaccinated horses oral and intrarectal seroconverted to bcov after the second vaccine administration in conclusion the results show that the modified-live bcov is safe to administer to horses via various routes causes minimal virus shedding and results in detectable antibodies to bcov in 27% of the vaccinates
the membrane m protein of canine coronavirus ccov was cloned and expressed in e coli . the purified recombinant protein was then evaluated for its antigenicity and reliability in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for detection of ccov antibodies in dog sera fifty serum samples screened previously by whole virus elisa and western blotting were tested when the performance of the new test was compared with those of whole virus elisa and western blotting an excellent correlation was found with the latter two assays the elisa based on recombinant m protein represents an alternative and valid test for detection of antibodies to ccov in dog sera #
the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv jhm strain induces a biphasic disease in balb/c mice that consists of an acute retinitis followed by progression to a chronic retinal degeneration with autoimmune reactivity retinal degeneration resistant cd-1 mice do not develop either the late phase or autoimmune reactivity a mouse rpe/choroid dna expression library was screened using sera from virus infected balb/c mice two clones were identified villin-2 protein and α-fodrin protein α-fodrin protein was used for further analysis and western blot reactivity was seen only in sera from virus infected balb/c mice cd4 t cells were shown to specifically react with mhv antigens and with α-fodrin protein these studies clearly identified both antibody and cd4 t cell reactivities to α-fodrin in sera from virus infected retinal degenerative susceptible balb/c mice
induces high levels of antibodies produced both systemically and locally immunization with mlv-vaccines amervac and porcilis produces sufficient antibody levels and also cell-mediated immunity after infection virus secretion gradually decreases in group b3 indicating tendency to induce sterile immunity
coronavirus disease 2019 is an on-going pandemic attributed to a novel virus named sars-cov-2 comparing the statistics of incidence and death rates between nations reveals that there is discrepancy amongst countries in these regards even between countries that share borders we herein present information from the literature indicating how cross-protection against covid-19 conferred by the encephalitis vaccine could be the reason for lower fatality rate in the countries where immunization against encephalitis is widespread or included in national programs this may pave the way for arriving at efficient prevention strategies as well as vaccine development
in sweden a particular subtype of verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli vtec o157h7 originally defined as being of phage type 4 and carrying two vtx 2 genes has been found to cause the majority of reported human infections during the past 15 years including both sporadic cases and outbreaks one plausible explanation for this could be that this particular subtype is better adapted to colonise cattle and thereby may be excreted in greater concentrations and for longer periods than other vtec o157h7 subtypes in an experimental study 4 calves were inoculated with 10 9 colony forming units cfu of strain ccug 53931 representative of the subtype vtec o157h7 pt4vtx 2 vtx 2c . two uninoculated calves were co-housed with the inoculated calves initially the vtec o157h7 strain had been isolated from a dairy herd with naturally occurring infection and the farm had previously also been linked to human infection with the same strain faecal samples were collected over up to a 2-month period and analysed for vtec o157 by immuno-magnetic separation ims and ims positive samples were further analysed by direct plating to elucidate the shedding pattern samples were also collected from the pharynx results all inoculated calves proved culture-positive in faeces within 24 hours after inoculation and the un-inoculated calves similarly on days 1 and 3 post-inoculation one calf was persistently culture-positive for 43 days in the remainder the vtec o157h7 count in faeces decreased over the first 2 weeks all pharyngeal samples were culture-negative for vtec o157h7 this study contributes with information concerning the dynamics of a specific subtype of vtec o157h7 colonisation in dairy calves this subtype vtec o157h7 pt4vtx 2 vtx 2c is frequently isolated from swedish cattle and has also been found to cause the majority of reported human infections in sweden during the past 15 years in most calves inoculated with a representative strain of this specific subtype the numbers of shed bacteria declined over the first two weeks one calf could possibly be classified as a high-shedder excreting high levels of the bacterium for a prolonged period
background the nasopharyngeal np microbiota plays an important role in bovine health comprising a rich and diverse microbial community the nasopharynx is also the niche for potentially pathogenic agents which are associated with bovine respiratory disease brd a serious and costly illness in feedlot cattle we used 14 beef heifers from a closed and disease-free herd to assess the dynamics of the np microbiota of cattle that are transported to a feedlot cattle were sampled prior to transport to the feedlot day 0 and at days 2 7 and 14 results the structure of the np microbiota changed significantly over the course of the study with the largest shift occurring between day 0 prior to transport and day 2 p < 0.001 phylogenetic diversity and richness increased following feedlot placement day 2 p < 0.05 the genera pasteurella bacillus and proteus were enriched at day 0 streptococcus and acinetobacter at day 2 bifidobacterium at day 7 and mycoplasma at day 14 the functional potential of the np microbiota was assessed using picrust revealing that replication and repair as well as translation pathways were more relatively abundant in day 14 samples these differences were driven mostly by mycoplasma although eight cattle were culture-positive for the brd-associated bacterium pasteurella multocida at one or more sampling times none were culture-positive for mannheimia haemolytica or histophilus somni conclusions this study investigated the effect that feedlot placement has on the np microbiota of beef cattle over a 14-d period within two days of transport to the feedlot the np microbiota changed significantly increasing in both phylogenetic diversity and richness these results demonstrate that there is an abrupt shift in the np microbiota of cattle after transportation to a feedlot this may have importance for understanding why cattle are most susceptible to brd after feedlot placement
to combat the possibility of a zoonotic h5n1 pandemic in a timely fashion it is necessary to develop a vaccine that would confer protection against homologous and heterologous human h5n1 influenza viruses using a replicating modified vaccinia virus tian tan strain mvtt as a vaccine vector we constructed mvtt ha-qh and mvtt ha-ah which expresses the h5 gene of a goose-derived qinghai strain a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived anhui strain a/anhui/1/ 2005 the immunogenicity profiles of both vaccine candidates were evaluated vaccination with mvtt ha-qh induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies nabs against a homologous strain and a wide range of h5n1 pseudoviruses clades 1 2.1 2.2 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 neutralization tests nt and haemagglutination inhibition hi antibodies inhibit the live autologous virus as well as a homologous a/xingjiang/1/2006 and a heterologous a/vietnam/1194/2004 representing two human isolates from clade 2.2 and clade 1 respectively importantly mice vaccinated with intranasal mvtt ha-qh were completely protected from challenge with lethal dosages of a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 and the a/viet nam/ 1194/2004 respectively but not control mice that received a mock mvtt s vaccine however mvtt ha-ah induced much lower levels of nt against its autologous strain our results suggest that it is feasible to use the h5 gene from a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 to construct an effective vaccine when using mvtt as a vector to prevent infections against homologous and genetically divergent human h5n1 influenza viruses
the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was identified as a coronavirus cov following the outbreak of 2002-2003 there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for sars-cov infections potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models the aged balb/c mouse model for sars supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics sars in the elderly we tested two preventive strategies vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody to determine the extent of protection achieved against sars-cov challenge in this model these approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice this study validates the utility of the aged balb/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis published by elsevier ltd
background antibodies constitute a powerful tool to study protein function protein localization and proteinprotein interactions as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes high-throughput antibody development requires faster methodologies with lower antigen consumption results here we describe a novel methodology to select human monoclonal recombinant antibodies by combining in vitro protein expression phage display antibody libraries and antibody microarrays the application of this combination of methodologies permitted us to generate human single-chain variable fragments scfvs against two proteins green fluorescent protein gfp and thioredoxin trx in a short time using as low as 5 μg of purified protein these scfvs showed specific reactivity against their respective targets and worked well by elisa and western blot the scfvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot conclusion this work describes a novel and miniaturized methodology to obtain human monoclonal recombinant antibodies against any target in a shorter time than other methodologies using only 5 μg of protein the protocol could be easily adapted to a high-throughput procedure for antibody production
emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause morbidity and mortality in human and animal populations resulting in serious public and animal health threats and economic losses the ongoing outbreak of a highly contagious and deadly porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in asia the americas and europe is one example genomic sequence analyses of pedv variants have revealed important insights into the evolution of pedv however the antigenic variations among different pedv strains are less explored although they may contribute to the failure of pedv vaccines in asian countries in addition the evolution of pedv results in variants with distinct genetic features and virulence differences thus pedv can serve as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus evolution and pathogenesis in this article we review the evolution antigenic relationships and pathologic features of pedv strains this information and review of researches will aid in the development of strategies for control and prevention of ped

the sharp increase in antibiotic resistance imposes a global threat to human health and the discovery of effective antimicrobial alternatives is needed the use of probiotics to combat bacterial pathogens has gained a rising interest pathogenic escherichia coli is causative of multiple clinical syndromes such as diarrheal diseases meningitis and urinary tract infections in this work we evaluated the efficacy of probiotics to control multidrug-resistant e coli and reduce their ability to form biofilms six e coli resistant to at least five antibiotics ceftazidime ampicillin clarithromycin amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were isolated in this work preparations of cell-free spent media cfsm of six probiotics belonging to the genus bifidobacterium and lactobacillus which were grown in man-rogosa-sharpe mrs broth exhibited strong antibacterial activity inhibition zones of 11.77-23.10 mm against all e coli isolates two e coli isolates namely e coli ww1 and ic2 which were most resistant to all antibiotics were subjected to antibiofilm experiments interestingly the cfsm of mrs fermented by all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation while b longum caused highest inhibition 57.94% in case of e coli ic2 biofilms and l plantarum was responsible for 64.57% reduction of e coli ww1 biofilms on the other hand cfsm of skim milk fermented by l helveticus and l rhamnosus exhibited a slight inhibitory activity against ic2 isolate inhibition percentage of 31.52 and 17 68 respectively while ww1 isolate biofilms was reduced by cfsm of milk fermented by b longum and l helveticus 70.81 and 69.49 reduction percentage respectively these results support the effective use of probiotics as antimicrobial alternatives and to eradicate biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant e coli
the pepscan procedure was used to identify betanodavirus b-cell epitopes recognized by neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs and serum samples obtained from sea bass dicentrarchus labrax naturally infected with betanodavirus pepscan was performed with a panel of thirty-four 12-mer synthetic peptides that mimicked the entire betanodavirus capsid protein sea bass serum samples reacted strongly with three regions of the capsid protein comprising amino acid residues 1-32 91-162 and 181-212 the latter region was also recognized by neutralizing mabs and coincided with a region of high antigenic propensity identified by an antigen prediction algorithm these data suggest that a region of the betanodavirus capsid protein spanning amino acid residues 181-212 may represent a neutralization domain that could potentially be used to inform the development of nodavirus vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents
| surviving a single infection often results in lifelong immunity to the infecting pathogen such protection is mediated in large part by two main b cell memory 'walls' -namely longlived plasma cells and memory b cells the cellular and molecular processes that drive the production of long-lived plasma cells and memory b cells are subjects of intensive research and have important implications for global health indeed although nearly all vaccines in use today depend on their ability to induce b cell memory we have not yet succeeded in developing vaccines for some of the world's most deadly diseases including aids and malaria here we describe the two-phase process by which antigen drives the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory b cells and highlight the challenges for successful vaccine development in each phase
background the aim of this study was to detect the associations between bovine herpesvirus 1 bhv-1 status of a herd and respiratory disease brd occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows the association between management-related factors and higher brd occurrence was also estimated methods serum samples collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds were analyzed for antibodies against bhv-1 bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv bovine viral diarrhoea virus bvdv and mycoplasma bovis a questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager multiple correspondence analysis mca and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors results a low to moderate prevalence 1-49% of brsv antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease or = 6.2 p = 0.010 in cows and in-calf heifers employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease larger herd size loose-housing of cows housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows the highest risk of abortions > 1.3% and increased insemination index number of inseminations per pregnancy > 1.9 occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of bhv-1 antibodies 1-49% in cows conclusions bhv-1 was not associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle however was significantly related to reproductive performance brsv possesses the main role in respiratory disease complex in adult dairy cattle
the novel h7n9 avian influenza a virus has caused human infections in china since 2013 some isolates from the fifth wave of infections have emerged as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of h7n9 viruses can be rapidly and efficiently produced with low-level biocontainment facilities in this study recombinant h7 antigen was obtained from engineered stable clones of chinese hamster ovary cho cells for subsequent large-scale production the stable cho cell clones were also adapted to grow in serum-free suspension cultures to improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant h7 antigens we evaluated the use of a novel combination adjuvant of pelc and cpg pelc/cpg to augment the anti-h7n9 immune responses in mice we compared the effects with other adjuvants such as alum addavax mf59-like and several toll-like receptor ligands such as r848 cpg and poly ic with the pelc/cpg combination adjuvant cho cell-expressed rh7 antigens containing terminally sialylated complex type n-glycans were able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in sera and conferred protection following live virus challenges these data indicate that the cho cell-expressed recombinant h7 antigens and a pelc/cpg combination adjuvant can be used for h7n9 subunit vaccine development
vaccination programs against infectious bronchitis virus ibv in egypt depend on both classical and/or imported variant ibv strain vaccines however many ibv outbreaks associated with respiratory distress nephropathy and high mortalities were attributed to the circulation of both classical and new nephropathogenic ibv variant 2 strains in the present study we report the development of attenuated ibv candidate vaccines using the classic ibv strains ibm41 and ib2 and a nephropathogenic strain ibvar2 the wild-type wt viruses were attenuated through serial passages in embryonated specific pathogen free spf chicken eggs virulence of the attenuated viruses was then tested via the ocular route inoculation and the in vivo back passage in day-old spf chickens efficacy against homologous challenge was investigated also in day-old spf chickens results showed that the viruses were successfully adapted to the embryo by the 100th ibm41 and ib2 and 110th passages ibvar2 the attenuated viruses were safe and showed no change of virulence in day-old spf chickens up to the 10th back passages the efficacy experiment showed that the attenuated vaccines showed 90 to 100% protection against the homologous challenge based on ciliostasis score and protection percent the att-ibm41 and att-ib2 vaccines were able to reduce the shedding of the challenge at 3 days post-infection dpi and no virus shedding was detected in both vaccinated groups by 5 dpi in the att-ibvar2 vaccinated birds only 20% of vaccinated birds shed the challenge virus with low titers 10 2.10±0.3 eid 50 /ml at 3 dpi in conclusion the attenuated strains ibm41 ib2 and ibvar2 are efficient vaccine candidates against currently circulating classic and variant ib viruses respectively further studies to evaluate the field efficacy and combining these attenuated ibv strains to induce a wider protection against heterologous ibv challenge are suggested
background classical swine fever virus csfv belongs to the genus pestivirus within the family flaviviridae virulent strains of classical swine fever virus csfv cause severe disease in pigs characterized by immunosuppression thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which causes significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide methods to reveal proteomic changes in swine serum during the acute stage of lethal csfv infection 5 of 10 pigs were inoculated with the virulent csfv shimen strain the remainder serving as uninfected controls a serum sample was taken at 3 days post-infection from each swine at a stage when there were no clinical symptoms other than increased rectal temperatures ≥40°c the samples were treated to remove serum albumin and immunoglobulin igg and then subjected to two-dimension differential gel electrophoresis results quantitative intensity analysis revealed 17 protein spots showing at least 1.5-fold quantitative alteration in expression ten spots were successfully identified by maldi-tof ms or ltq ms expression of 4 proteins was increased and 6 decreased in csfv-infected pigs functions of these proteins included blood coagulation antiinflammatory activity and angiogenesis conclusion these proteins with altered expression may have important implications in the pathogenesis of classical swine fever and provide a clue for identification of biomarkers for classical swine fever early diagnosis
since 2015 outbreaks of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome hps caused by a novel genotype of fowl adenovirus 4 fadv-4 infection have created serious economic losses in china given that other serotypes of hypervirulent fadvs have also been reported in poultry around the world a common elisa for all serotypes within the group i fowl adenoviruses fadv-i is urgently needed especially for clinical epidemic serotypes in this study we used high purity and concentration virions of fadv-4 and developed a common elisa for detecting antibodies against 12 fadv-i serotypes the developed elisa was able to distinguish between antibodies against fadv-i fadv-iii and other heterologous viruses without any cross-reaction furthermore the elisa showed higher sensitivity than the fadv-1-based elisa to the novel fadv-4 found in china moreover since there are no commercial vaccines against fadvs in china the elisa was applied to detect sera samples from specific pathogen-free chickens inoculated with inactivated fadv-1 fadv-4 and fadv-8a the assay showed high sensitivities for all three detected serotypes within fadv-i in conclusion a novel common elisa for fadv-i was developed in this study and could be a powerful tool for seroepidemiological investigations and fadvs vaccine development
in an outbreak of diarrhea among 82 artificially reared red deer calves 56 developed the disease and 20 subsequently died during the outbreak 80% of diarrheal and 50070 of apparently healthy calves excreted cryptosporidial oocysts in feces the coincidence of infection with cryptosporidium and clinical diarrhea suggested a causal relationship histologic examination of intestinal sections from a necropsied deer calf showed lesions consistent with field and experimental cryptosporidiosis in other species the deer cryptosporidium subclinically infected newborn mice in indirect immunofluorescence tests it could not be distinguished from a calf cryptosporidium
a central nervous system cns disorder characterized by non-suppurative encephalomyelitis with neurological signs was induced experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs by intravenous and oral or intranasal inoculation of the porcine teschovirus ptv toyama 2002 strain isolated from breeding pigs in japan lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells focal gliosis neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia were observed in the brainstem cerebellum and spinal cord non-suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed regardless of the route of inoculation all pigs infected experimentally with ptv showed a similar distribution of cns lesions histological lesions in the cns caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus were mild compared with those induced by intravenous infection immunohistochemically the distribution of ptv antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions ptv particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of ptv rna in the cns tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated direct cns invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for ptv the gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of ptv pathogenesis

porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an enteric coronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in porcine herds worldwide although both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been extensively used the emergence of highly virulent strains and the recurrent outbreaks even in vaccinated farms highlight the need of effective vaccines engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development in this line we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev genome expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent united states us pedv strain this virus rtgev-rs-spedv was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died in addition the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus the rtgev-rs-spedv vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent pedv us strain pedv-nvsl the rtgev-rs-spedv virus protected against challenge with a virulent pedv strain reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus rna levels in feces the rtgev-rs-spedv virus induced a humoral immune response specific for pedv including neutralizing antibodies altogether the data indicated that rtgev-rs-spedv is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent pedv infection
three hundred sera were collected from horses in various parts of mongolia in 2007 and seroepidemiological surveys for several equine viruses performed on them equid herpesvirus 1 and equine rhinitis a virus were prevalent and equine arteritis virus and equid herpesvirus 3 were detected over a wide area though their rates of antibody-positivity were not high equine infectious anemia was distributed locally the rates of horses antibody-positive for japanese encephalitis virus and equine influenza virus were low but these were detected bovine coronavirus antibodies were detected at a high rate but it was not clear whether they were due to horse coronavirus
emerging viruses including nipah hendra lujo and junin viruses have enormous potential to spread rapidly nipah virus after emerging as a zoonosis has also evolved the capacity for human-to-human transmission most of the diseases caused by these pathogens are untreatable and require high biocontainment conditions universal methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are urgently needed we have developed a modular antiviral platform strategy that relies on simple bioinformatic and genetic information about each pathogen central to this platform is the use of envelope glycoprotein cdnas to establish multi-cycle replication systems under bsl2 conditions for viral pathogens that normally require bsl3 and bsl4 facilities we generated monoclonal antibodies against nipah g by cdna immunization in rats and we showed that these antibodies neutralize both nipah and hendra live viruses we then used these effective henipavirus inhibitors to validate our screening strategy our proposed strategy should contribute to the response capability for emerging infectious diseases providing a way to initiate antiviral development immediately upon identifying novel viruses
canine coronavirus ccv is a common faecal agent which is difficult to isolate this study shows ccv to survive well at temperatures below -20°c but not at temperatures above 4°. the presence of faecal material markedly reduced ccv survival times at temperatures ranging from 20°c to -70°c thus it is suggested that diagnostic faecal material should be diluted 110 w/v with growth medium and examined at the earliest opportunity
causes of diarrhoea with particular reference to viral agents were investigated in 123 infants and young children in dares salaam tanzania twenty-six of the patients also had measles viruses were found in 52 of the 123 patients 43 per cent and rotavirus occurred in 38 children 31 per cent enteroviruses were found in 10 patients adenoviruses in nine and 'small round virus' in one six patients had dual infection four patients died and only one of these children had viral particles in the stools breast milk formed part or all of the diet in 77 children 63 per cent and virus isolation showed a similar pattern in breast fed infants and those not receiving breast milk in 26 patients with measles only five were excreting viruses in their stools therefore no strong evidence was found to link the diarrhoea associated with measles in tanzanian children to any particular virus the pattern of virus infection causing infantile diarrhoea was similar in dares salaam to other parts of the world
bats are crucial for proper functioning of an ecosystem they provide various important services to ecosystem and environment while bats are well-known carrier of pathogenic viruses their possible role as a potential carrier of pathogenic bacteria is under-explored here using culture-based approach employing multiple bacteriological media over thousand bacteria were cultivated and identified from rousettus leschenaultii a frugivorous bat species the majority of which were from the family enterobacteriaceae and putative pathogens next pathogenic potential of most frequently cultivated component of microbiome i e escherichia coli was assessed to identify its known pathotypes which revealed the presence of virulent factors in many cultivated e coli isolates applying in-depth bacterial community analysis using high-throughput 16 s rrna gene sequencing a high inter-individual variation was observed among the studied guano samples interestingly a higher diversity of bacterial communities was observed in decaying guano representative the search against human pathogenic bacteria database at 97% identity a small proportion of sequences were found associated to wellknown human pathogens the present study thus indicates that this bat species may carry potential bacterial pathogens and advice to study the effect of these pathogens on bats itself and the probable mode of transmission to humans and other animals
aynaud j m bernard s bottreau e lantier i salmon h and vannier ph 1991 induction of lactogenic immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine using an attenuated coronavirus mutant able to survive in the physicochemical environment of the digestive tract vet microbiol 26 227-239 a transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus mutant 188-sg selected as attenuated and resistant to acidity and proteases of the digestive tract of adult pigs was used as vaccine "nouzilly strain" in sows to protect suckling piglets against a challenge exposure carried out with a highly virulent tgev strain the pregnant sows were immunized once 42-49 days before farrowing or twice 42-49 and 7-15 days before farrowing by the oral intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-sg strain sows exposed to virulent tgev in the field and experimentally infected sows two oral inoculations during pregnancy were used as positive controls leading to high protection the neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk no protection against mortality was observed in the litters of 1 the nine seronegative susceptible sows with piglet mortality of 65/70 2 the seven once orally vaccinated sows with mortality of 44/54 3 the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route with mortality of 55/76 moderate protection was observed in 1 the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36 / 90 2 the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31 / 51 in contrast improved protection was observed in 1 the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally with piglet mortality of 23/95 2 the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41 3 the six sows experimentally infected with virulent tgev with piglet mortality of 1/59 no correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets the results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against tgev is induced only by repeated ingestion of the attenuated 188-sg strain of tgev
full-length infectious cdna clones have recently become available for both european and north american genotypes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and it is now possible to alter the prrsv genome and create genetically defined mutant viruses among many possible applications of the prrsv infectious cdna clones development of genetically modified vaccines is of particular interest using infectious clones the prrsv genome has been manipulated by changing individual amino acids deleting coding regions inserting foreign sequences and generating arterivirus chimeras the limited available data suggest that all structural proteins of prrsv are essential for replication of the virus and that prrsv infectivity is relatively intolerant of subtle changes within the structural proteins the major tasks in prrsv research are to identify virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms and to understand the structure-function relationships of individual viral proteins utilizing these infectious clones as tools a new generation of safe and efficacious prrs vaccines may be constructed #
we collected rectal swabs from dogs in japan during 2011 to 2014 and canine coronavirus ccov nucleocapsid gene was detected by rt-pcr the relationship between ccov infection and the manifestation of diarrhea symptoms was investigated and a correlation was noted df=1 χ 2 =8.90 p<0.005 the types of ccov detected in samples from ccov-infected dogs were ccov-i in 88.9% and ccov-ii in 7.4% respectively we retrospectively investigated the seroprevalence of ccov-i in dogs in japan during 1998 to 2006 the sera were tested with a neutralizing antibody test in the absence of ccov-i laboratory strain we used feline coronavirus fcov-i that shares high sequence homology in the s protein with ccov-i 77.7% of the sera were positive for neutralizing anti-fcov-i antibodies
the novel coronavirus covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses instead the rate of transmission is significative higher with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations especially tetanic diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit as coronaviruses and other communitycirculating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against covid-19 the first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics "spanish flu" 1918 "asian flu" 1956 and "the hong kong flu" 1968 among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines the immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit cd4+ memory t cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response according to this hypothesis vaccine formulations tetanus diphtheria bordetella pertussis could be re-administrate after the first contact with covid-19 better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ards acute respiratory distress syndrome the cd4+ memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses avoiding or limiting "lung crash" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged finally this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients but also before infection in fact people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the covid-19 will occur
feline coronaviruses fcovs are the causative agents of severe systemic disease feline infectious peritonitis fip in domestic and wild cats fcovs have been classified into serotypes i and ii type i fcov is the dominant serotype approximately 70-90% worldwide therefore it is necessary to provide antiviral agents for type i fcov infection in this study we demonstrated that itraconazole icz practically used for fungal infections in cats inhibits the type i fcov infection icz also exhibited antiviral effect in cells after viral infection suggesting that icz could potentially be used as a therapeutic
background imported horses that have undergone recent long distance transport might represent a serious risk for spreading infectious respiratory pathogens into populations of horses objective to investigate the frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in recently imported horses animals all imported horses with signed owner consent n 5 167 entering a usda quarantine for contagious equine metritis from october 2014 to june 2016 were enrolled in the study methods prospective observational study enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine samples were assayed for equine influenza virus eiv equine herpesvirus type-1 22 24 and 25 ehv-1 22 24 25 equine rhinitis virus a erav and b erbv and streptococcus equi subspecies equi s equi using quantitative pcr qpcr results equine herpesviruses were detected by qpcr in 52% of the study horses including ehv-2 28.7% ehv-5 40.7% ehv-1 1.2% and ehv-4 3.0%. clinical signs were not correlated with being qpcr-positive for ehv-4 ehv-2 or ehv-5 none of the samples were qpcr-positive for eiv erav erbv and s equi the qpcr assay failed quality control for rna viruses in 25% 46/ 167 of samples conclusions and clinical importance clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qpcr positive status for ehv-2 24 and 25 the importance of g-herpesviruses ehv-2 and 5 in respiratory disease is poorly understood equine herpesvirus type-1 or 4 ehv-1 or ehv-4 were detected in 4.2% of horses which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses biosecurity measures are important when introducing recently imported horses into resident us populations of horses k e y w o r d s biosecurity equine herpesvirus transport
pigs are increasingly recognized to harbor a wide range of viruses that apparently establish long-term persistence in these animals they serve as reservoirs for a number of human zoonotic diseases in this study a porcine astrovirus pastv strain designated as pastv jwh-1
thiazolides are polypharmacology agents with at least three mechanisms of action against a broad spectrum of parasites bacteria and viruses in respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level nitazoxanide 1a the prototype thiazolide was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections the second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide such as the 5-chloro analogue rm-5038 2a are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite tizoxanide 1b are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives while rm-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative rm-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives recently 1a has completed phase ii-iii clinical trials in the united states canada australia and new zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses the chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed in order to improve their systemic absorption new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and rm4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology pharmacokinetics and toxicology rm-5061 8a in rats showed 7-fold higher blood concentration compared to 1a absolute bioavailability increased from 3 to 20% with a good safety profile in animal safety pharmacology and toxicology
the recombinant antibody fragments generated against the toxic components of scorpion venoms are considered a promising alternative for obtaining new antivenoms for therapy using directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis it was possible to generate a human single-chain antibody fragment with a broad cross-reactivity that retained recognition for its original antigen this variant is the first antibody fragment that neutralizes the effect of an estimated 13 neurotoxins present in the venom of nine species of mexican scorpions this single antibody fragment showed the properties of a polyvalent antivenom these results represent a significant advance in the development of new antivenoms against scorpion stings since the number of components would be minimized due to their broad cross-neutralization capacity while at the same time bypassing animal immunization key contribution innovative antivenoms can be constituted by a few recombinant antibody fragments a cross-neutralizing scfv against several scorpion venoms was generated by a semi-rational strategy of in vitro maturation
the current practice for diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection relies on pcr testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk this testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date here we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from sars-cov-2 in addition to sars-cov mers-cov common human coronavirus strains and other common respiratory viruses a preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the sars-cov-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high igg reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low igg reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including s2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein this array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding sars-cov-2 infection including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course how the antibody response to infection develops over time and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development
partetravirus is a recently described group of animal parvoviruses which include the human partetravirus bovine partetravirus and porcine partetravirus previously known as human parvovirus 4 bovine hokovirus and porcine hokovirus respectively in this report we describe the discovery and genomic characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from china these partetraviruses were detected by pcr in 1.8% of bovine liver samples 66.7% of ovine liver samples and 71.4% of ovine spleen samples one of the bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a novel genotype the ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses the genome organization is conserved amongst these viruses including the presence of a putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in orf2 results from the present study provide further support to the classification of partetraviruses as a separate genus in parvovirinae
ixodes pacificus ticks can harbor a wide range of human and animal pathogens to survey the prevalence of tick-borne known and putative pathogens we tested 982 individual adult and nymphal i pacificus ticks collected throughout california between 2007 and 2009 using a broad-range pcr and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry pcr/esi-ms assay designed to detect a wide range of tick-borne microorganisms overall 1.4% of the ticks were found to be infected with borrelia burgdorferi 2.0% were infected with borrelia miyamotoi and 0.3% were infected with anaplasma phagocytophilum in addition 3.0% were infected with babesia odocoilei about 1.2% of the ticks were co-infected with more than one pathogen or putative pathogen in addition we identified a novel anaplasmataceae species that we characterized by sequencing of its 16s rrna groel glta and rpob genes sequence analysis indicated that this organism is phylogenetically distinct from known anaplasma species with its closest genetic near neighbors coming from asia the prevalence of this novel anaplasmataceae species was as high as 21% at one site and it was detected in 4.9% of ticks tested statewide based upon this genetic characterization we propose that this organism be called 'candidatus cryptoplasma californiense'. knowledge of this novel microbe will provide awareness for the community about the breadth of the i pacificus microbiome the concept that this bacterium could be more widely spread and an opportunity to explore whether this bacterium also contributes to human or animal disease burden
the major histocompatibility complex mhc class i b gene/allelic repertoire was investigated in a pedigreed population of cynomolgus macaques of mixed indonesian/malaysian origin the mafa-b alleles detected in this cohort are mostly specific for a given geographic area and only a small number of alleles appears to be shared with other populations this suggests the fast evolution of mafa-b alleles due to adaptation to new environments in contrast to humans the b locus in old world monkeys displays extensive copy number variation the mafa-b and previously defined -a gene combinations segregate in families and thus allowed the definition of extended haplotypes in many cases it was possible to assign a particular mafa-i allele to one of these mafa-a/b haplotypes as well the presence of a large number of stable haplotypes in this cohort of animals which was pedigreed for up to eight generations looks promising for developing discriminative mhc typing tools that are less cumbersome furthermore the discovery of 53 unreported mafa-b sequences expands the lexicon of alleles significantly and may help in understanding the complex organisation of the macaque b region
h9n2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus lpaiv is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines the disease still remains widespread we speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of h9n2 viruses in this study we constructed a novel lactococcus lactis l lactis strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the m1 and ha2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic h9n2 virus strain the m1-ha2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from l lactis by western blotting we assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant l lactis strain eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant l lactis strain fecal and intestinal samples sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7 14 and 21 days post-vaccination dpv chickens vaccinated with the recombinant l lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies t cell-mediated immune responses and mucosal secretory iga siga following challenge with h9n2 virus at 21 dpv chickens vaccinated with the recombinant l lactis strain showed decreased weight loss lower viral titers in the lung and reduced lung pathological damage in summary our results demonstrated that a recombinant l lactis strain expressing an h9n2 m1-ha2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity this oral vaccine is h9n2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control h9n2 virus infection
when we look back to edward jenner vaccination of a young man in 1796 we cannot help thinking that he was both lucky and crazy crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox a quite devastating disease and lucky because even considering that he did not know this at that time he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent not only was he able to protect the young man but he took the first step towards the development of a vast new field vaccination it is acceptable to say that jenner was lucky because he succeeded in promoting protection against smallpox using a cowpox virus and this induction of protection in a cross-reactive way is believed to be quite rare nevertheless more and more examples of cross-reactive immune responses are being described and we are beginning to admit that cross-reactivity is far more common and important than we used to think here we review cross-reactivity in the immune system and the plasticity of t cell recognition based on the existence of t cell receptor promiscuous recognition and cross-recognition of conserved viral immunodominant epitopes we propose two approaches to develop wide spectrum viral vaccines the first one is based on the identification characterization and cloning of immunodominant viral epitopes able to stimulate responses against different viruses the produced peptides could then be purified and serve as a basis for vaccine therapies a second strategy is based on the identification of conserved patterns in immunodominant viral peptides and the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for mhc anchoring and tcr contact although we are still far from a complete knowledge of the crossreactivity phenomenon in the immune system the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes and the identification of particular ''viral patterns'' seems to be important steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines
using incipient lines of the collaborative cross cc a murine genetic reference population we previously identified a quantitative trait loci qtl associated with low sars-cov titer in this study we integrated sequence information and rna expression of genes within the qtl to identify mucin 4 muc4 as a high priority candidate for controlling sars-cov titer in the lung to test this hypothesis we infected muc4 -/mice and found that female but not male muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with sars-cov femalemuc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology however no change in viral titers was observed comparing across viral families studies with chikungunya virus a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus suggests that muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread although not confirming the original titer qtl our data identifies a role for muc4 in the sars-cov disease and viral pathogenesis given the recent emergence of sars-cov-2 this work suggest that muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following sars-cov infection with the sars-cov-2 outbreak continuing treatments that modulate or enhance muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes in addition the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes
identification of viral b-cell epitopes is of importance in the selection of peptides for inclusion into subunit vaccines the development of virus-specific serological tests and understanding the interaction of antibodies with viruses at a molecular level b-cell epitopes can often be determined unequivocally by x-ray analyses of antibody-antigen complexes this technique is however time-consuming and alternative strategies have now been developed for identifying epitopes this article provides an overview of approaches which are currently available for mapping and imitating b-cell epitopes
lactococcus lactis has previously been proposed as a vaccine platform for the safe delivery of heterologous antigens here we utilized l lactis as a live vector for expression of listeriolysin o llo a major listeria monocytogenes antigen and virulence factor a variety of plasmid constructs were designed to permit either constitutive or nisin-inducible expression of secreted or non-secreted llo in l lactis recombinant strains were subsequently tested in a murine model for vaccination efficacy against l monocytogenes infection cd8 + t lymphocytes specific for the llo 91-99 epitope were detected when strains were administered via the intraperitoneal ip but not the oral route challenge with live l monocytogenes revealed different levels of protection among the three vaccine strains tested with the nisin-inducible llo-secreting l lactis strain providing the greatest protection against secondary infection this work highlights the usefulness of the gras generally regarded as safe organism l lactis as the basis of a live vaccine vector against l monocytogenes the work suggests that llo-expressing l lactis strains may also have the potential to act as a platform for directing other co-expressed antigens towards the cytosolic mhc class i pathway for enhanced stimulation of the cd8 + t-cell response
a cytopathic virus was isolated using madin-darby bovine kidney mdbk cells from lung tissue of alpaca that died of a severe respiratory infection to identify the virus the infected cell culture supernatant was enriched for virus particles and a generic pcr-based method was used to amplify potential viral sequences genomic sequence data of the alpaca isolate was obtained and compared with sequences of known viruses the new alpaca virus sequence was most similar to recently designated enterovirus species f previously bovine enterovirus bevs viruses that are globally prevalent in cattle although they appear not to cause significant disease because bovine enteroviruses have not been previously reported in u s alpaca we suspect that this type of infection is fairly rare and in this case appeared not to spread beyond the original outbreak the capsid sequence of the detected virus had greatest homology to enterovirus f type 1 indicating that the virus should be considered a member of serotype 1 but the virus had greater homology in 2a protease sequence to type 3 suggesting that it may have been a recombinant identifying pathogens that infect a new host species for the first time can be challenging as the disease in a new host species may be quite different from that in the original or natural host the pathogen may not be suspected based on the clinical presentation delaying diagnosis although this virus replicated in mdbk cells existing standard culture and molecular methods could not identify it in this case a highly sensitive generic pcr-based pathogen-detection method was used to identify this pathogen
• bats are hosts to a range of pathogens some of which are known to infect and cause disease in humans and domestic animals human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for these infections to spill over from bats to humans in the future • understanding the impacts of anthropogenic changes on infection dynamics within bat populations is necessary to predict and prevent human infections of bat origin however this initially requires understanding both bat populations and the dynamics of infections within them • we propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mathematical models to elucidate aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses bats are hosts to a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts including humans involve a complex mixture of processes and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover in particular only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles including their ability to fly often highly gregarious social structures long lifespans and low fecundity rates we highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics we identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses if commonalities can be found then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible this modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics
four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides chicken heterophil peptides 1 and 2 and turkey heterophil peptides 1 and 3 were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens which are harbored by birds at concentrations of 16-2 pg/ ml all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of candida albicans salmonella enteriditis and campylobacter jejuni none of the peptides including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine used as a positive control were able to reduce the survival of pusteurellu multocidu by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration 16 pg/ml tested at 16 pg/ml the turkey peptide thp3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of bordetella avium escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less this peptide thp3 does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides under our experimental conditions none of the peptides neutralized infectious bronchitis virus an enveloped coronavirus of chickens
background bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens this study aimed to monitor coronaviruses covs and paramyxoviruses pmvs in bats roosting in northwest italian regions our investigation was focused on covs and pmvs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments results family-wide pcr screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as pcr positive with an overall detection rate of 12.6% . cov rna was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species while pmv rna in three pipistrellus spp phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha-covs 5 beta-covs and three pmvs moreover one p pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both cov and pmv a divergent alpha-cov clade from myotis nattereri spa is also described the compact cluster of beta-covs from r ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database specifically for this species in europe to our knowledge this is the first report of covs in plecotus auritus and m oxygnathus and of pmvs in p kuhlii conclusions this study identified alpha and beta-covs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed italian regions to our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of pmvs in italy the 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases considering the amount of novel bat-borne pmvs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years the definition of viral diversity within european bat species is needed performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats
background atopic sensitization to the house dust mite hdm is associated with altered antibody responses to the nasopharyngeal colonizing bacterium haemophilus influenzae and children admitted to the emergency department for asthma exacerbation have reduced igg responses to hdm allergens objective to investigate anti-bacterial and anti-allergen antibody responses during convalescence from asthma exacerbation and differences found in exacerbations associated with and without viral infection results ige antibodies to the p6 bacterial antigen increased in 60% of sera during convalescence and for many children achieved titres as high as ige titres to allergens in contrast ige anti-hdm titres declined during convalescence the anti-bacterial ige titres were the same in subjects with and without virus infection while the anti-hdm ige declined more rapidly in virus-infected subjects igg titres to the major hdm allergens showed no consistent increase and the overall igg anti-hdm titres even declined in subjects without a virus infection anti-bacterial igg antibodies in contrast to ige did not change patients with frequent episodic or persistent asthma had similar ige anti-bacterial titres to patients with infrequent asthma during the acute phase although they had reduced igg titres to both the bacteria and the hdm conclusions during the period following an acute exacerbation of asthma there was a marked and specific increase in anti-bacterial ige compared with a reduced ige response to hdm this provides further support for the concept of t-helper type 2 responses to bacterial antigens playing a role in asthma pathogenesis
we investigated humancalicivirus hcv-associated diarrheain children attending day carecenters byusing stoolspecimens collected in 1981-1983 we used a screening enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa derived from reagents prepared against the sapporostrain of hcv andconfirmed positive results with a blocking elisa andimmunosorbent electron microscopy hcv was detected in 11 2.9% of 375 diarrheal stools and in noneof 86stools fromasymptomatic contacts thisincidence ratewas half that noted for rotaviruses and higher than that noted for campylobaeter salmonella and shigella in the original study hcv was found in stoolspecimens from children in nine daycare centers hcv-associated diarrheawas sporadic occurred with greater frequency in young children and had a summer-fall predominance our results indicate that hev is an important cause of diarrheain daycarecenters and that frozen stoolsamples can yield epidemiological data on hcv infection

epizootic pathogens pose a major threat to many wildlife species particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments pangolins order pholidota are highly threatened mammals in large part due to the trade in illegal wildlife during july to august 2018 four sick wild pangolins three manis javanica and one manis pentadactyla exhibiting a variety of clinical symptoms were rescued by the jinhua wildlife protection station in zhejiang province china although three of these animals died fortunately one recovered after 2 weeks of symptomatic treatment using meta-transcriptomics combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr we identified two novel rna viruses in two of the dead pangolins genomic analysis revealed that these viruses were most closely related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses although still highly genetically distinct with more than 48 and 25 per cent sequence divergence at the amino acid level respectively we named these dongyang pangolin virus dypv and lishui pangolin virus lspv based on the sampling site and hosts although coltiviruses lspv are known to be transmitted by ticks we found no evidence of lspv in ticks sampled close to where the pangolins were collected in addition although dypv was present in nymph ticks amblyomma javanense collected from a diseased pangolin they were not found in the local tick population epidemiological investigation revealed that both novel viruses might have been imported following the illegal international trade of pangolins hence these data indicate that illegal wildlife trafficking not only threatens the status of pangolin populations but may also spread epizootic pathogens
murine hepatitis viruses provide excellent animal models for the study of virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract several studies have indirectly provided evidence that the spike glycoprotein s of these coronaviruses bears determinants for pathogenesis and the induction of protective immunity in order to directly evaluate the immunogenicity of this protein it was purified by affinity chromatography with an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective monoclonal antibody which immunoprecipitated the 180-kda spike glycoprotein of the neurotropic a59 strain of murine hepatitis virus mhv-a59 mice immunized twice with approximately 1 ag of purified s in freund's adjuvant developed high titers of neutralizing and fusion inhibiting antibodies even though the protein was at least partially denaturated after elution from the affinity column moreover these mice were protected from lethal encephalitis when challenged intracerebrally with 10 ldso of mhv-a59 this study provides a direct demonstration of the importance of the coronavirus spike giycoprotein in the induction of a protective immune response o 1ssoacademic press inc

avian inßuenza caused by avian inßuenza virus aiv has a negative impact on poultry production low-pathogenic aiv lpaiv is naturally present in wild birds and the introduction of the virus into domestic poultry is assumed to occur through contact with wild birds and by human activity including the movement of live and dead poultry and fomites such as clothing and vehicles at present the possible role of insects in the spread of aiv is dubious the objective of the present work was to investigate the potential transmission of lpaiv by persistence of the virus in the alimentary tract of house ßies musca domestica l diptera muscidae flies were fed three virus concentrations of two aiv strains and then incubated at different temperatures for up to 24 h the persistence of the two virus strains in the ßies declined with increasing incubation temperatures and incubation periods similarly increased virus uptake by the ßies increased the persistence of virus persistence of infective aiv in ßies differed signiþcantly between the two virus strains the laboratory experiments of the present study indicate that the house ßy can be a potential carrier of aiv key words avian inßuenza virus insect carrier transmission house ßy musca domestica . newly emerged ßies were kept in cages and supplied sucrose powdered milk and tap water ad libitum until used in the experiments at 4 ð 6 d of age except for one experiment female ßies were used preoviposition virus strains low-pathogenic h7n1 a/african starling/england/983/79 supplied by vla weybridge united kingdom and h5n7 a/mallard/ denmark/75.64.650/03 aiv strains were propagated in speciþc-pathogen-free spf embryonated chicken eggs eces lohmann cuxhaven germany infective allantoic ßuid af was stored at ϫ80њc until use the titers of h5n7 and h7n1 were 10 7.9 and 10 8.5 50% of egg lethal dose eld 50 /ml respectively when titrated in 9 ð11-d-old spf embryos by 10-fold dilutions one batch of each virus was used throughout the entire experiment two-fold virus dilutions were prepared in a sterile 10 mm phosphatebuffered saline pbs solution for use in the experiments aiv exposure of house flies in total of 1195 ßies were virus-fed sham-fed or negative controls the two aiv subtypes were used in separate experiments and three independent experiments were performed with each virus strain after feeding the ßies were kept for 6 12 or 24 h at 15 25 or 35њc in humidiþed incubators with 40 ð70% rh and 24-h light before experiments ßies were deprived of water and feed overnight and kept chilled in the dark before feeding with the aiv suspensions the ßies were anesthetized with co 2 and placed individually in disposable sterile 1000-l pipette tips cut to size for the ßyõs head and lapping proboscis to protrude from this position each ßy dined on 1-l volume of sterile or viruspositive af diluted in pbs supplied by micropipette flies were fed two-fold diluted virus solutions 2 0 2 ϫ2 or 2 ϫ4 hence each ßy was fed h5n7 virus doses equivalent to 10
feline calicivirus fcv and feline herpesvirus type 1 fhv-1 are the two primary causes of upper respiratory tract disease in cats the aim of this study was to demonstrate the distribution of fcv and fhv-1 among the feline population of several counties in rio grande do sul state brazil to this end conjunctival and nasal swabs were collected from 302 cats from different locations including households breeding catteries veterinary clinics animal hospitals and experimental research facilities the samples were collected between july 2006 to june 2009 the virus isolation was performed in crfk cells and subsequently the identification was confirmed by pcr fcv fhv-1 or both were isolated from 55 cats from 28 different locations fcv alone was isolated from 52.7% 29/55 of the animals that tested positively fhv-1 alone was isolated from 38.2% 21/55 of the animals that tested positively and coinfection were detected in 9.1% 5/55 of the animals that tested positively virus detection was more prevalent in cats that were less than 1 year old among animals that shared a living space with other cats and females fcv and fhv-1 were isolated from vaccinated cats in addition both viruses were isolated from cats that showed no signs of disease the results suggest that a carrier state is common for both viruses in the evaluated population a search for other causes of respiratory disease in that population is necessary and further studies relating to the molecular characterization of viruses and vaccine efficacy are also necessary
the majority of emerging infectious diseases have their source in animals and emergence occurs at the human/animal interface when infections in animals breech the species barrier to infect humans the population in which they are often first identified the response is frequently characterized by a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature if infection is found to have a source in animals and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection culling is often recommended with severe economic impact currently efforts are being undertaken for closer interaction at the animal/human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment between the animal and human medicine sectors and research is underway in geographic areas where emergence at the animal/human interface has occurred in the past the goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals to genetically sequence these organisms and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations it may be more cost-effective to learn from past emergence events and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance detection and response in humans to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors or determinants that influence animal infection these determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural
data from ev-d68-infected patients demonstrate that pathological changes in the lower respiratory tract are principally characterized by severe respiratory illness in children and acute flaccid myelitis however lack of a suitable animal model for ev-d68 infection has limited the study on the pathogenesis of this critical pathogen and the development of a vaccine ferrets have been widely used to evaluate respiratory virus infections in the current study we used ev-d68-infected ferrets as a potential animal to identify impersonal indices involving clinical features and histopathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract urt and lrt the research results demonstrate that the ev-d68 virus leads to minimal clinical symptoms in ferrets according to the viral load detection in the feces nasal and respiratory tracts the infection and shedding of ev-d68 in the ferret model was confirmed and these results were supported by the ev-d68 vp1 immunofluorescence confocal imaging with α26-linked sialic acid sa in lung tissues furthermore we detected the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression level which implied high expression levels of interleukin il-1a il-8 il-5 il-12 il-13 and il-17a in the lungs these data indicate that systemic observation of responses following infection with ev-d68 in ferrets could be used as a model for ev-d68 infection and pathogenesis
influenza a viruses iavs are zoonotic pathogens that cause yearly outbreaks with high rates of morbidity and fatality the virus continuously acquires point mutations while circulating in several hosts ranging from aquatic birds to mammals including humans the wide range of hosts provides influenza a viruses greater chances of genetic re-assortment leading to the emergence of zoonotic strains and occasional pandemics that have a severe impact on human life four major influenza pandemics have been reported to date and health authorities worldwide have shown tremendous progress in efforts to control epidemics and pandemics here we primarily discuss the pathogenesis of influenza virus type a its epidemiology pandemic potential current status of antiviral drugs and vaccines and ways to effectively manage the disease during a crisis
aims to develop time-dependent dose-response models for highly pathogenic avian influenza a hpai of the h5n1 subtype virus methods and results a total of four candidate time-dependent dose-response models were fitted to four survival data sets for animals mice or ferrets exposed to graded doses of hpai h5n1 virus using the maximum-likelihood estimation a beta-poisson dose-response model with the n 50 parameter modified by an exponential-inverse-power time dependency or an exponential doseresponse model with the k parameter modified by an exponential-inverse time dependency provided a statistically adequate fit to the observed survival data conclusions we have successfully developed the time-dependent doseresponse models to describe the mortality of animals exposed to an hpai h5n1 virus the developed model describes the mortality over time and represents observed experimental responses accurately significance and impact of the study this is the first study describing timedependent dose-response models for hpai h5n1 virus the developed models will be a useful tool for estimating the mortality of hpai h5n1 virus which may depend on time postexposure for the preparation of a future influenza pandemic caused by this lethal virus
a b s t r a c t sars-cov was the cause of the global pandemic in 2003 that infected over 8000 people in 8 months vaccines against sars are still not available we developed a novel method to produce high levels of a recombinant sars virus-like particles vlps vaccine containing the sars spike s protein and the influenza m1 protein using the baculovirus insect cell expression system these chimeric sars vlps have a similar size and morphology to the wild type sars-cov we tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified chimeric sars vlps and full length sars s protein vaccines in a mouse lethal challenge model the sars vlp vaccine containing 0.8 g of sars s protein completely protected mice from death when administered intramuscular im or intranasal in routes in the absence of an adjuvant likewise the sars vlp vaccine containing 4 g of s protein without adjuvant reduced lung virus titer to below detectable level protected mice from weight loss and elicited a high level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov sf9 cell-produced full length purified sars s protein was also an effective vaccine against sars-cov but only when co-administered im with aluminum hydroxide sars-cov vlps are highly immunogenic and induce neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge sf9 cell-based vlp vaccines are a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic agents
bats are known reservoirs for numerous emerging infectious diseases occupy unique ecological niches and occur globally except for antarctica given their impact on human and agricultural health it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying immunocompetence in this reservoir host to date few studies have examined immune function in the order chiroptera particularly among natural colonies of bats the phytohemagglutinin pha skin test has been widely used to measure delayed-type cellular immune response in a wide variety of vertebrates and has been routinely employed in immunoecological studies although this test is frequently described as a measure of t cell proliferation recent studies indicate it may represent a combination of immune responses in mammals the immune response is differentially temporally and spatially regulated therefore we characterized the infiltrating leukocyte response to the pha skin test in bats by examining a time-series of histological sections from pha and saline injection areas in 41 brazilian free-tailed bats tadarida brasiliensis results suggest that bats exhibit diverse leukocyte traffic within 6 h and up to 24 h following subcutaneous pha injection there was a significant presence of lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as eosinophils basophils and macrophages observed in the pha-injected tissues compared with saline-injected control tissues we observed a highly significant negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in pha-injected tissue with peak lymphocyte response at 12 h and peak neutrophil response at 24 h post-injection these results indicate substantial variation in the immune response of individuals and may aid our understanding of disease emergence in natural populations of bats
feline calicivirus fcv causes upper respiratory tract infections in felines and threatens the health of wild and domestic felines clinically specific drugs to treat fcv have not yet been developed here igg was extracted from inactivated fcv-immunized horse sera equine fab' 2 fragments were obtained from pepsin-digested igg and then purified by protein-g column chromatography in our study equine immunoglobulin fab' 2 fragments showed efficient neutralizing activity in vitro against fcv and had therapeutic and prophylactic effects in fcvinfected cats the anti-fcv-specific fab' 2 fragment can significantly alleviate the clinical symptoms of fcvinfected cats and reduce the viral loads of the trachea lung and spleen these results indicate that the fab' 2 fragment prepared from inactivated fcv-immunized horses may be used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for diseases caused by fcv
eighteen mouse ascitic fluids containing monoclonal antibodies mabs directed against crystallized hexon of adenovirus av type 1 were used to map the antigenic structure of the capsomer in reciprocal competitive binding elisa with the help of peroxidase-labelled mabs at least nine epitopes epitope clusters located on three distinct antigenic sites were identified on the hexon epitope on antigenic site i recognized by two mabs could be the genus specific antigenic determinant based on the broad reactivity patterns of the mabs epitopes on the antigenic site ii recognized by fifteen mabs could be divided into seven epitope clusters according to the competition patterns antigenic site iii recognized by one mab completely differs from the antigenic site i and on the basis of one-way blocking with all the mabs specific for antigenic site ii should be also different from the latter one the data suggest that the seven epitope clusters of antigenic site ii contain partially overlapping epitopes and may be a part of a large single immunodominant antigenic region on av 1 hexon as well as on hexons of heterologous types
background severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by infection with sars-associated coronavirus cov amino acid residues 450-650 of the spike s glycoprotein of sars-cov s450-650 contains dominant epitopes for anti-viral antibodies abs in patient sera objectives to develop and evaluate an elisa system for detection of anti-s abs in patient sera study design express recombinant s450-650 in e coli and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an elisa system based on the s450-650 polypeptide results the s450-650-based elisa detected igg abs in 41 out of 51 serum samples from 22 hospitalized patients with probable sars a result closely correlated with that obtained with a virus-based elisa r = 0.75 k = 0.8 differential anti-s igg responses were observed amongst sars patients some of them produced anti-s abs early during their infection while others failed to make igg abs against the s450-650 polypeptide none of the serum samples from 100 healthy blood donors was positive in the s450-650-based assay conclusion the s450-650-based elisa can detect anti-s igg abs with high sensitivity and specificity

vaccines against human pathogenic fungi a rather neglected medical need until few years ago are now gaining steps in the public health priority scale the awareness of the rising medical threat represented by the opportunistic fungal infections among the health care-associated infections the advances in the knowledge of fungal pathogenicity and immune response and the extraordinary progress of biotechnology have generated enthusiasm and critical new tools for active and passive anti-fungal vaccination the discovery that antibodies play a critical role for protection against fungal infection has greatly contributed to the advancements in this field in recognition that almost all useful vaccines against viral and bacterial pathogens owe their protective efficacy to neutralizing opsonizing or otherwise effective antibodies overall there is more hope now than few years ago about the chances of generating and having approved by the regulatory authorities one or more antifungal vaccines be active or passive for use in humans in the next few years in particular the possibility of protecting against multiple opportunistic mycoses in immuno-depressed subjects with a single well-defined glucan-conjugate vaccine eliciting directly anti-fungal antibodies may be an important step to achieve this public health goal 1

the economic consequences of bovine diarrhea are serious few long-term epidemiological data are available concerning the causative pathogens of bovine diarrhea in japan from 2002 to 2011 surveillance of enteric pathogens was performed in cows of various breed and age from 302 farms in which diarrhea had occurred in yamagata prefecture japan differences between dairy and beef cows in the number of cases of diarrhea and rates of infection by salmonella spp and eimeria spp were found clinical symptoms duration of epidemic hematochezia and complications caused by bovine rotavirus infection were milder than those caused by bovine coronavirus infection
viral infections are an important and often unrecognized component of disease in immunocompromised patients the diagnosis and management of viral infections have expanded largely because of new quantitative molecular diagnostic assays well-recognized pathogens such as herpes simplex virus hsv cytomegalovirus cmv and respiratory viruses have been joined by newly recognized pathogens such as bk virus human herpesvirus-6 hhv-6 and human metapneumovirus in this highly susceptible patient population the role of epstein-barr virus ebv and human herpesvirus-8 hhv-8 in lymphoproliferative diseases also continue to be clarified as a result the management of viral infections in patients with hematologic malignancies continues to be a growing challenge for the clinician
originally isolated from swine the proposed influenza d virus has since been shown to be common in cattle inoculation of idv to naïve calves resulted in mild respiratory disease histologically characterized by tracheitis as several studies have associated the presence of idv with acute bovine respiratory disease brd we sought to investigate the efficacy of an inactivated idv vaccine vaccinated calves seroconverted with hemagglutination inhibition titers 137-169 following two doses non-vaccinated calves challenged with a homologous virus exhibited signs of mild respiratory disease from days four to ten post challenge which was significantly different than negative controls at days five and nine post challenge peak viral shedding of approximately 5 tcid 50 /ml was measured in nasal and tracheal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids four to six days post challenge viral titers were significantly p < 0.05 decreased 1.4 tcid 50 /ml 3.6 tcid 50 /ml and 5.0 tcid 50 /ml respectively in the aforementioned samples collected from vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated controls at peak shedding viral antigen was detected in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates and trachea by immunohistochemistry from all unvaccinated calves but in significantly fewer vaccinates inflammation characterized by neutrophils was observed in the nasal turbinate and trachea but not appreciably in lungs together these results support an etiologic role for idv in brd and demonstrate that partial protection is afforded by an inactivated vaccine
the pattern of tissue tropism for several prototype and uneharacterized strains of mouse hepatitis virus mhv was studied by intranasal inoculation of each virus strain into groups of neonatal swiss mice under otherwise identical conditions mice were killed at intervals up to 18 days after inoculation and their tissues were examined for the presence of 5{hv antigen by indirect immunofluorescence two patterns of infection were apparent prototype mhv strains 1 3 a59 jhm s and uncharacterized mhv strmns tettnang and wt-1 produced a respiratory pattern in which nose and lung were consistently involved with dissemination to other organs in a vascular distribution pulmonary vascular endothelium and alveolar septal cells but not airway epithelium were infected an enteric pattern was observed with mhv-y and wt-2 in which n h v antigen was largely restricted to the nose and bowel with limited dissemination to other abdominal organs but not lung intestinal lesions in these mice were severe compared to those manifesting the respiratory pattern of infection these results indicate that like coronaviruses of other species different strains of mhv possess different primary and secondary organotropisms following a natural route of inoculation in a susceptible host
human adenovirus 5 adhu5 vectors are robust vaccine platforms however the presence of naturally-acquired neutralizing antibodies may reduce vector efficacy and potential for re-administration this study evaluates immune responses and protection following vaccination with a replication-incompetent porcine adenovirus 3 pav3 vector as an alternative vaccine to adhu5 using an avian influenza h5n1 disease model vaccine efficacy was evaluated in balb/c mice following vaccination with different doses of the pav3 vector expressing an optimized a/hanoi/30408/2005 h5n1 hemagglutinin antigen pav3-ha and compared with an adhu5-ha control pav3-ha rapidly generated antibody responses with significant neutralizing antibody titers on day 21 and stronger cellular immune responses detected on day 8 compared to adhu5-ha the pav3-ha vaccine administered 8 days before challenge demonstrated improved survival and lower virus load evaluation of long-term vaccine efficacy at 12 months post-vaccination showed better protection with the pav3-ha than with the adhu5-ha vaccine importantly as opposed to adhu5 pav3 vector was not significantly neutralized by human antibodies pooled from over 10000 individuals overall pav3-based vector is capable of mediating swift strong immune responses and offer a promising alternative to adhu5
objectives of the present work were i to confirm pathogens implicated in cases of diarrhoea in newborn and young lambs in sheep farms in greece and ii to investigate a possible relation in dissemination of pathogens between lambs and dogs present in the farm work was carried out in 22 sheep farms with i flock size over 150 animals ii presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and iii close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48 h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm in total samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents in total 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies e coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered other bacteria isolated were enterobacter spp proteus spp klebsiella spp lambs and puppies clostridium perfringens citrobacter freundi salmonella enterica subsp diarizonae only lambs and streptococcus spp only puppies group a rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs 2.5% and parvovirus in samples from puppies 5%. cryptosporidium spp oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies this is the first report of isolation of s enterica subsp diarizonae and of detection of rotavirus from lambs in greece rates of e coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were in general smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs two pairs of isolates from the same farm one from a lamb and one from a puppy with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other
background avian influenza viruses of h9n2 subtype have become highly prevalent in avian species although these viruses generally cause only mild to moderate disease they can infect a wide variety of species including chickens quail turkeys ducks geese pheasant partridge and pigeon even transmitted to mammalian species including humans accelerating the efforts to devise protective strategies against them results the results showed that stronger immune responses were induced in a mouse model immunized with bv-dual-ha than in those vaccinated with a dna vaccine encoding the same antigen moreover complete protection against lethal challenge with h9n2 virus was observed in mice conclusion bv-dual-ha could be utilized as a vaccine candidate against h9n2 virus infection
a recombinant baculovirus containing a cdna which encodes haemagglutininneuraminidase hn of newcastle disease virus ndv was constructed spodqteru frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of hn glycoprotein similar to the authentic hn in size the recombinant hn glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities the antigenic properties of the recombinant hn glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies and were completely protected from the ndv challenge correspondence tot m niikura
to determine if a hypersensitive-type lung pathology might occur when mice were given an inactivated mers-cov vaccine and challenged with infectious virus as was seen with sars-cov vaccines we prepared and vaccinated mice with an inactivated mers-cov vaccine neutralizing antibody was induced by vaccine with and without adjuvant and lung virus was reduced in vaccinated mice after challenge lung mononuclear infiltrates occurred in all groups after virus challenge but with increased infiltrates that contained eosinophils and increases in the eosinophil promoting il-5 and il-13 cytokines only in the vaccine groups inactivated mers-cov vaccine appears to carry a hypersensitive-type lung pathology risk from mers-cov infection that is similar to that found with inactivated sars-cov vaccines from sars-cov infection
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged in the guangdong province of china in late 2002 and spread to 29 countries by the end of the outbreak in july 2003 the cdc and who reported 8437 cases with a 9.6% case fatality rate the disease was caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus sars-cov drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines several vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in pre-clinical trials available data suggest that vaccines should be based on the the 180 kda viral spike protein s the only significant neutralization antigen capable of inducing protective immune responses in animals in the absence of clinical cases of sars candidate vaccines should be evaluated for efficacy in animal models and although it is uncertain whether the united states food and drug administration's "animal rule" would apply to licensure of a sars vaccine it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality this report summarizes the recommendations from a who technical meeting on animal models and antibody assays for evaluating candidate sars vaccines held on 25-26 august 2005 in south mimms uk provides guidance on the use of animal models and outlines the steps to develop standard reagents and assays for immunological evaluation of candidate sars vaccines
andes virus andv is highly pathogenic in humans and is the primary etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps in south america case-fatality rates are as high as 50% and there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies for infection our laboratory has recently developed a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-based vaccine that expressed the glycoproteins of andes virus in place of the native vsv glycoprotein g this vaccine is highly efficacious in the syrian hamster model of hcps when given 28 days before challenge with andv or when given around the time of challenge peri-exposure and even protects when administered post-exposure herein we sought to test the durability of the immune response to a single dose of this vaccine in syrian hamsters this vaccine was efficacious in hamsters challenged intranasally with andv 6 months after vaccination p = 0.025 but animals were not significantly protected following 1 year of vaccination p = 0.090 the decrease in protection correlated with a reduction of measurable neutralizing antibody responses and suggests that a more robust vaccination schedule might be required to provide long-term immunity
to characterize the antigenic epitopes of the hemagglutinin ha protein of h1n1 influenza virus a panel consisting of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies mabs were generated using the ha proteins from the 2009 pandemic h1n1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza h1n1a1 vaccines thirty-three 39% of the 84 mabs were found to be strain-specific and 6 7% of the 84 mabs were subtype-specific twenty 24% of the 84 mabs recognized the common ha epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic h1n1 seasonal a1 h1n1 and a3 h3n2 influenza viruses twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common ha epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic h1n1 seasonal a1 h1n1 and a3 h3n2 human influenza viruses and h5n1 and h9n2 avian influenza viruses we found that of the 16 19% clones of the 84 mabs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens 15 were made using the ha of the seasonal a1 h1n1 virus and 1 was made using the ha of the 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza virus immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray tma showed that 4 of the 84 mab clones cross-reacted with human tissue brain and pancreas our results indicated that the influenza virus ha antigenic epitopes not only induce type- subtype- and strain-specific monoclonal antibodies against influenza a virus but also cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against human tissues further investigations of these cross-reactive heterophilic epitopes may significantly improve our understanding of viral antigenic variation epidemics pathophysiologic mechanisms and adverse effects of influenza vaccines
antibody genetic resistance to a novel h9n2 virus was less robust though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident the existence of host-genetic determination of the outcome of influenza infection offers tools for the further dissection of this regulation and also for understanding the mechanisms of influenza transmission within and between birds
a total of 106 children below 5 years of age admitted to the kasturba medical college hospital manipal karnataka south india were investigated over a period of 6 months to determine the aetiological role of viruses in acute diarrhoea viral aetiological agents isolated were rotaviruses in 12 11 per cent cases adenoviruses in 3 3 per cent cases corona virus and astroviruses in two 2 per cent cases each non-viral isolates were cryptosporidium and salmonella typhimurium in two cases each and entamoeba histolytica and shigella flexneri in one case each
unlike its mosquito-borne relatives such as dengue west nile and japanese encephalitis viruses which can cause severe human diseases zika virus zikv has emerged from obscurity by its association with a suspected "congenital zika syndrome" while causing asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections which are dengue-or rubella-like in infected individuals despite having been discovered in uganda for almost 60 years <20 human cases were reported before 2007 the massive epidemics in the pacific islands associated with the zikv asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in latin america in 2015 although increased mosquito breeding associated with the el niño effect superimposed on global warming is suspected genetic changes in its rna virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes other animal reservoirs and human we reviewed the epidemiology clinical manifestation virology pathogenesis laboratory diagnosis management and prevention of this emerging infection laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion transplantation sexual activity breastfeeding respiratory droplet and animal bite is discussed epidemic journal of infection 2016 72 507e524 control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds personal protection against mosquito bite and hopefully a safe and effective vaccine
vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is a promising vector for vaccine and oncolysis but it can also produce acute diseases in cattle horses and swine characterized by vesiculation and ulceration of the tongue oral tissues feet and teats in experimental animals primates rats and mice vsv has been shown to lead to neurotoxicities such as hind limb paralysis the virus matrix protein m and glycoprotein g are both major pathogenic determinants of wild-type vsv and have been the major targets for the production of attenuated strains existing strategies for attenuation included 1 deletion or m51r substitution in the m protein vsv m51 or vsvm51r respectively 2 truncation of the c-terminus of the g protein g 28 despite these mutations recombinant vsv with mutated m protein is only moderately attenuated in animals whereas there are no detailed reports to determine the pathogenicity of recombinant vsv with truncated g protein at high dose thus a novel recombinant vsv vsv m51-g 28 as well as other attenuated vsvs vsv m51 vsv-g 28 were produced to determine their efficacy as vaccine vectors with low pathogenicity in vitro studies indicated that truncated g protein g 28 could play a more important role than deletion of m51 m51 for attenuation of recombinant vsv vsv m51-g 28 was determined to be the most attenuated virus with low pathogenicity in mice with vsv-g 28 also showing relatively reduced pathogenicity further neutralizing antibodies stimulated by vsv-g 28 proved to be significantly higher than in mice treated with vsv m51-g 28 in conclusion among different attenuated vsvs with mutated m and/or g proteins recombinant vsv with only truncated g protein vsv-g 28 demonstrated ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulating a protective immune response these properties make vsv-g 28 a promising vaccine vector and vaccine candidate for preventing vesicular stomatitis disease
porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped is a highly contagious and devastating enteric disease of pigs caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv an enveloped single-stranded rna virus belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus of the coronaviridae family the disease is clinically similar to other forms of porcine gastroenteritis pigs are the only known host of the disease and the occurrence of ped in wild boars is unknown the virus causes acute diarrhoea vomiting dehydration and high mortality in suckling piglets reaching 100%. heavy economic losses in the pig-farming industry were sustained in the usa between 2013 and 2015 when pedv spread very quickly and resulted in epidemics the loss in the us pig industry has been estimated at almost seven million pigs the purpose of this review is a description of the current status of porcine epidemic diarrhoea in european pigs and the risk presented by the introduction of pedv to poland in comparison to the epidemics in the usa
