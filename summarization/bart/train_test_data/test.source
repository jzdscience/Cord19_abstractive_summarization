background diarrhoea induces massive problems in the rearing of calves the aim of the study was to obtain current data about the frequency of giardia spp cryptosporidium spp and eimeria spp in diarrhoeic calves in southern germany with the particular focus on giardiosis results 1564 samples were analysed for the three pathogens using microscopical methods giardia spp was detectable in 112/1564 samples 7.2%. the mean age was 46.5 days and the odds of being infected with giardia spp increased slowly up to 8 times from about 12 days to 30 days of age there appeared to be no seasonal influence on the frequency of giardia spp a mono-infection with giardia spp was diagnosed in 46 calves 2.9% whereas 15 calves 1.0% had a mixed-infection with cryptosporidium spp and 51 calves 3.3% with eimeria spp cryptosporidium spp and eimeria spp could be detected in 646/1564 samples 41.3% and 208/1564 samples 13.3% respectively with a mean age of 11.3 and 55.0 days respectively the odds of being infected with cryptosporidium spp increased up to 4.5 times until an age of 10 days after that the odds decreased continuously and was approaching zero at about 30 days the odds of being infected with eimeria spp increased continuously up to 30 times from about 20 days to 60 days of age there appeared to be no significant seasonal influence on the frequency of cryptosporidium spp but there was one for eimeria spp the odds of being infected with eimeria spp in march and april decreased by about half and increased up to 2.3 times between july and september additionally as requested by the veterinarians 1282 of those samples were analysed for e coli rota- coronavirus and cryptosporidium spp using an elisa obtained frequencies for these pathogens were 0.9% 37.8% 3.4% and 45.3% with a mean age of 24.8 days 12.1 days 9.0 days and 12.1 days respectively the results indicate that in southern germany in addition to eimeria spp giardia spp seems to play a contributing role in diarrhoea in older calves whereas cryptosporidium spp and rotavirus are mostly relevant in young calves
pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 ad5 is common in the general population bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize ad5 vaccine efficacy vaccination by the intramuscular i m nasal i n or oral p o route with ad5 expressing ebola zaire glycoprotein ad5-zgp fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with ebola in the presence of pre-existing immunity only mice vaccinated i n survived the frequency of ifn-c+ cd8+ t cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the i m and p o routes respectively neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of ifn-c+ cd8+ t cells 3.961% naïve vs 3.661% pre-existing immunity pei nor anti-ebola neutralizing antibody nab 40610 reciprocal dilution both groups the number of inf-c+ cd8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid bal after i n immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to ad5 146614 naïve vs 120616 sfc/million mncs pei however pre-existing immunity reduced nab levels in bal by 25% in this group to improve the immune response after oral vaccination the ad5-based vaccine was pegylated mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of ifn-c+ cd8+ t cells 10 days after administration 0.360.3% peg vs 1.760.5% unmodified pegylation did increase nab levels 2-fold these results provide some insight about the degree of t and b cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an ad5-based vaccine
the specific identification of 100 adenoviruses detected in faeces by electron microscopy was attempted using a combination of group-specific and sub-genus f type 40/41 specific enzyme assays and isolation in cell culture followed by specific neutralization sixty-three were considered to be adf strains i e types 40 or 41 and 37 of which 33 were isolated in cell culture were deemed to be non-adf serotypes the relevance of these results in relation to the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis is discussed
a recombinant sars-cov spike s glycoprotein vaccine produced in insect cells in a pre-clinical development stage is described a truncated version of s glycoprotein containing only the ecto-domain as well as a his-tagged full-length version were cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line expressf+ ® . the proteins purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography were formulated without adjuvant at 3 9 27 and 50 g per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard elisa reactivity against the s glycoprotein the truncated s protein was also formulated with an adjuvant aluminum hydroxide at 1 g per dose ±adjuvant and 5 g per dose ±adjuvant significantly enhanced immune responses manifested by higher titers of serum elisa and viral neutralizing antibodies were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of s glycoprotein these findings indicate that the ecto-domain of sars-cov s glycoprotein vaccine with or without adjuvant is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full s glycoprotein vaccine the development of sars-cov vaccines has become a priority for preparedness for future outbreaks to protect health care workers managing new cases as well as the general population a phase i clinical trial using killed-whole sars-cov vaccine has been conducted by sinovac biotech ltd however concerns have been raised for the use of inactivated virus vaccines based on observations with feline coronavirus there are also several subunit vaccines in pre-clinical development targeting sars-cov structural proteins including the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins other vaccine candidates include vector-based dna vaccines a combination of whole killed virus and dna vaccines inactivated whole virus vaccines a combination of dna and s-peptide vaccines and other recombinant proteins and their fragments 0264-410x/$ -see front matter
to clarify the prevalence of canine coronavirus ccov infection in japan faecal samples from 109 dogs with diarrhoea were examined for ccov rna together with canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 dna the detection rates of ccov and cpv-2 for dogs aged less than 1 year were 66.3% and 43.8% while those for dogs aged 1 year or older were 6.9% and 10.3% respectively which were significantly different p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003 respectively indicating not cpv-2 but ccov is an important diarrhoea-causing organism in juvenile dogs among the ccov-positive dogs 65.5% and 72.7% showed to be positive for ccov types i and ii respectively and simultaneous detection rate of both types was high at 40.0%. furthermore transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev-like ccov rna was detected from 8 dogs these findings indicate that ccov type i and tgev-like ccov are already circulating in japan though no reports have been presented to date
vaccination has achieved remarkable successes in the control of childhood viral diseases to control emerging infections however vaccines will need to be delivered to older individuals who unlike infants probably have had prior infection or vaccination with related viruses and thus have cross-reactive antibodies against the vaccines whether and how these cross-reactive antibodies impact live attenuated vaccination efficacy is unclear using an open-label randomized trial design we show that subjects with a specific range of cross-reactive antibody titres from a prior inactivated japanese encephalitis vaccination enhanced yellow fever yf immunogenicity upon yf vaccination enhancing titres of crossreactive antibodies prolonged yf vaccine viraemia provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses and induced adhesion molecules intrinsic to the activating fc-receptor signalling pathway namely immune semaphorins facilitating immune cell interactions and trafficking our findings clinically demonstrate antibody-enhanced infection and suggest that vaccine efficacy could be improved by exploiting cross-reactive antibodies clinical trial features to investigate how cross-reactive antibodies affect live attenuated vaccination we examined through an open
human papillomaviruses hpvs are a group of circular double-stranded dna viruses showing severe tropism to mucosal tissues a subset of hpvs especially hpv16 and 18 are the primary etiological cause for several epithelial cell malignancies causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide due to the high prevalence and mortality hpv-associated cancers have remained as a significant health problem in human society making an urgent need to develop an effective therapeutic vaccine against them achieving this goal is primarily dependent on the identification of efficient tumor-associated epitopes inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response previous information has shown that e5 e6 and e7 early proteins are responsible for the induction and maintenance of hpv-associated cancers therefore the prediction of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i t cell epitopes of hpv16 18 31 and 45 oncoproteins was targeted in this study for this purpose a twostep plan was designed to identify the most probable cd8+ t cell epitopes in the first step mhc-i and ii binding mhc-i processing mhc-i population coverage and mhc-i immunogenicity prediction analyses and in the second step mhc-i and ii protein-peptide docking epitope conservation and cross-reactivity with host antigens' analyses were carried out successively by different tools finally we introduced five probable cd8+ t cell epitopes for each oncoprotein of the hpv genotypes 60 epitopes in total which obtained better scores by an integrated approach these predicted epitopes are valuable candidates for in vitro or in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies against the hpv-associated cancers additionally this two-step plan that each step includes several analyses to find appropriate epitopes provides a rational basis for dna-or peptide-based vaccine development
commensal enteric bacteria maintain systemic immune responsiveness that protects against disseminated or localized infection in extra-intestinal tissues caused by pathogenic microbes however since shifts in infection susceptibility after commensal bacteria eradication have primarily been probed using viruses the broader applicability to other pathogen types remains undefined in sharp contrast to diminished antiviral immunity we show commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection against disseminated candida albicans fungal infection enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of ly6g hi ly6c int neutrophils and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice reciprocally depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal lps reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication this discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific cd8 + t cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after c albicans and influenza a virus infection thus positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity
background porcine circovirus 2 causes different clinical syndromes resulting in a significant economic loss in the pork industry three pigs with unexplained cardiac and multi-organ inflammation that tested negative for pcv2 and other known porcine pathogens were further analyzed methods histology was used to identify microscopic lesions in multiple tissues metagenomics was used to detect viral sequences in tissue homogenates in situ hybridization was used to detect viral rna expression in cardiac tissue results in all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus we called pcv3 with a replicase and capsid proteins showing 55 and 35 % identities to the genetically-closest proteins from a bat-feces associated circovirus and were even more distant to those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2 common microscopic lesions included non-suppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac arteriolitis viral mrna was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells deep sequencing in tissues also revealed the presence of porcine astrovirus 4 in all three animals as well as rotavirus a porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in individual cases conclusion the pathogenicity and molecular epidemiology of this new circovirus alone or in the context of co-infections warrants further investigations
several mechanisms of diarrhea are possible in ruminant neonates this article summarizes the various mechanismsit is important to remember that under physiologic conditions more fluid is secreted into the intestinal lumen and reabsorbed compared with the ingested amount therefore impaired reabsorption of fluids has a major impact on the fluid balance of the patient several diarrheal pathogens interfere with digestion and absorption by blunting intestinal villi as observed with rotavirus and coronavirus infections osmoticincreased solutes within the intestinal lumen osmotically pull more water into the lumen thereby resulting in dehydration of the patient osmotic particles disclosure the authors have nothing to disclose keywordsruminant enteritis infection juvenile neonate diarrheacommon causes of infectious enteritis in neonate and juvenile ruminants include viral bacterial and protozoal pathogens the most common presenting sign in ruminants with infectious enteritis is diarrhea diagnosis of the cause of enteritis has important zoonotic and herd health implications severity of clinical signs with similar pathogens may differ between calves and small ruminants treatment of enteritis involves supportive care to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances provision of nutritional support for the neonate prevention and treatment of endotoxemia or sepsis and pathogen-specific treatments when relevant and available
the emergence of new pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and ebola virus poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches monoclonal antibodies mabs have been successfully used to treat various diseases particularly cancer and immunological disorders antigen-specific mabs have been isolated using several different approaches including hybridoma transgenic mice phage display yeast display and single b-cell isolation consequently an increasing number of mabs which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection have been developed in this paper we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mab discovery compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mab production and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases we also review the application of recently developed human mabs against sars-cov mers-cov and ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mabs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases
in the absence of effective drugs controlling sars relies on the rapid identification of cases and appropriate management of the close contacts or effective vaccines for sars therefore developing specific and sensitive laboratory tests for sars as well as effective vaccines are necessary for national authorities results genes encoding truncated nucleocapsid n and spike s proteins of sarscov were cloned into the expression vector pqe30 and fusionally expressed in escherichia coli m15 the fusion protein was analyzed for reactivity with sars patients' sera and with anti-sera against the two human coronaviruses hcov 229e and hcov oc43 by elisa ifa and immunoblot assays furthermore to evaluate the antigen-specific humoral antibody and t-cell responses in mice the fusion protein was injected into 6-week-old balb/c mice and a neutralization test as well as a tcell analysis was performed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immunization balb/c mice were challenged intranasally with sarscov at day 33 post injection and viral loads were determined by fluorescent quantitative rt-pcr serological results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the truncated s-n fusion protein derived the sars virus were > 99% 457/460 and 100.00% 650/650 respectively furthermore there was no cross-reactivity with other two human coronaviruses high titers of antibodies to srascov appeared in the immunized mice and the neutralization test showed that antibodies to the fusion protein could inhibit sarscov the t cell proliferation showed that the fusion protein could induce an antigen-specific t-cell response fluorescent quantitative rt-pcr showed that balb/c mice challenged intranasally with sarscov at day 33 post injection were completely protected from virus replication the truncated s-n fusion protein is a suitable immunodiagnostic antigen and vaccine candidate

canine non-rabies combined vaccines are widely used to protect animals from infectious agents and also play an important role in public health we performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events vaaes including anaphylaxis in japan by distributing questionnaires on vaaes to veterinary hospitals from april 1 2006 through may 31 2007 valid responses were obtained for 57300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals we obtained vaaes information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital we found that of the 57300 359 dogs showed vaaes of the 359 dogs death was observed in 1 anaphylaxis in 41 dermatological signs in 244 gastrointestinal signs in 160 and other signs in 106 onset of vaaes was mostly observed within 12 h after vaccination n = 299 83.3%. in this study anaphylaxis events occurred within 60 min after vaccination and about half of these events occurred within 5 min n = 19 46.3%. furthermore where anaphylaxis was reported additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs 27 of these demonstrated collapse 87.1% 24 demonstrated cyanosis 77.4% and both signs occurred in 22 71.0%. higher rates of animal vaaes anaphylaxis and death were found in japan than in other countries further investigations including survey studies will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for vaaes and thus develop safer vaccines moreover it may also be necessary to continually update the data of vaaes
faecal samples from i 12 dogs both with and without diarrhoea were screened for parvovirus by a haemagglutination titration test and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses and virus-like particles on the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles were identified particles identified were coronaviruses coronavirus-like particles rotavirus-like particles papovavirus-like particles torovirus-like particles picomavirus-like particles 27 nm virus-like particles with projections and parvovirus-like particles which did not cause haemagglutination
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly emerging infectious disease the potential recurrence of the disease from animal reservoirs highlights the significance of development of safe and efficient vaccines to prevent a future sars epidemic in this study we expressed the recombinant receptor-binding domain rrbd in mammalian 293t cells insect sf9 cells and e coli respectively and compared their immunogenicity and protection against sars-cov infection in an established mouse model our results show that all rrbd proteins expressed in the above systems maintained intact conformation being able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and complete protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in mice albeit the rrbd expressed in 293t cells elicited stronger humoral immune responses with significantly higher neutralizing activity p < 0.05 than those expressed in sf9 and e coli cells these results suggest that all three rrbds are effective in eliciting immune responses and protection against sars-cov and any of the above expression systems can be used for production of rrbd-based sars subunit vaccines preference will be given to rrbd expressed in mammalian cells for future evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in a non-human primate model of sars because of its ability to refold into a native conformation more readily and to induce higher level of neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in e coli and insect cells
zoonotic pathogens are significant burdens on global public health because they are transmitted to humans from non-human animals the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors the 'dilution effect' proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity however the meta-analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors and their ecology rather than patterns of species biodiversity
hcov-nl63 is a recently identified respiratory virus its pathogenesis has not been fully unraveled because an animal model is currently lacking here we examined whether rhesus macaques encounter hcov-nl63 infections during life by examining the levels of antibodies to hcov-nl63 in time the animals were followed for 7 up till 19 years and in three animals we observed a steep rise in antibodies during follow up indicative of a natural infection with hcov-nl63
faecal samples from 434 calves under 1 year of age 307 diarrhoeal and 127 normal were collected from three dairy farms and one village in selected areas of bangladesh the samples were tested by an enzyme-linked immuncxx&ent assay elisa to detect the presence of rotavirus antigen of 402 daily calves tested 28 7.0% were positive of which 21 7.2% were from diarrhoeic calves and 7 6.3% from non-diarrhoeic calves rotavirus infection varied from farm to farm 2.7-9.2% and there was no positive response from any of the 32 village calves rotavirus was most commonly found in calves of 1 week of age or less up to 22.2% in one group but was not found in any cah~ later than 6 months of age more than 80% of rotavirus-positive samples from diarrhoeic calves exhibited a titre of 128 or more geometric mean 34.5+4.5 whereas nondiarrhoeal caives had titres less than or equal to 128 geometric mean = 291.9 suggesting that rotavinas infection in calves in bangladesh was mostly associated with diarrhoea

during the formulative stages of developing the species survival plan ssp for the cheetah the impact of infectious disease upon its survival in captivity was of prime consideration together with genetics nutrition physiology and behavior this paper summarizes the results of an infectious disease surveillance program initially designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity but subsequently supplemented with data from free-living cheetahs the focus was on two viral infections feline infectious peritonitis fip and feline rhinotracheitis virus results indicated that between 1989 and 1991 there was an increase in the seroprevalence number antibody-positive animals of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41% to 64% in captivity during this same time period there were only two documented cases of fip in cheetahs in the united states the results suggest that feline coronavirus feline enteric coronavirus-feline infectious peritonitis group or a closely related coronavirus of cheetahs is becoming endemic in the captive cheetah population further serologic results from 39 free-living cheetahs demonstrated that there was a high seroprevalence 61% to feline coronavirus although serum antibody titers were considerably lower than those encountered in captive cheetahs the observation of a high percentage of free-living cheetahs which were seropositive to feline herpesvirus 44% was unexpected since it has been generally regarded that this infection is primarily associated with cheetahs in captivity 0 1993 wiley-liss inc
hepatitis c virus hcv infects 2% of the world's population and is the leading cause of liver disease and liver transplantation it poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies however these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations the introduction of a hcv vaccine has been predicted using simulation models in a high risk population to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of hcv a vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce hcv incidence in this population virus like particles vlps are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses thus vlps represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses currently many vlp-based vaccines have entered clinical trials while licensed vlp vaccines for hepatitis b virus hbv and human papilloma virus hpv have been in use for many years the hcv core e1 and e2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic vlps while inclusion of hcv antigens into heterogenous chimeric vlps is also a promising approach these vlps are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial yeast mammalian plant or insect cells here this paper will review hcv vlp-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production
bats are a unique group of mammals well suited to be hosts for emerging viruses with current rates of deforestation and urbanization redistribution of bat habitats to urban and suburban areas may bring bats into closer contact with livestock and humans common flying fox pteropus medius previously known as pteropus giganteus forms large communal roosts on treetops often in close proximity to human habitation in sri lanka this report describes the detection of coronavirus rna in p medius bat guano collected in peradeniya sri lanka these viruses had >97% nucleotide identity with coronaviruses detected in cynopterus sphinx scotophilus heathii and s kuhlii bats in thailand pteropus medius is widespread in asia and appears to excrete group d coronaviruses which are hitherto confined to bats however these findings may have public health implications in the future coronavirus flying fox sri lanka
mucosal immunity establishes the first line of defence against pathogens entering the body via mucosal surfaces besides eliciting both local and systemic immunity mucosal vaccination strategies that are non-invasive in nature may increase patient compliance and reduce the need for vaccine application by trained personnel a relatively new concept is mucosal immunization using dna vaccines the advantages of dna vaccines such as the opportunity to combine the genetic information of various antigen epitopes and stimulatory cytokines the enhanced stability and ease of production make this class of vaccines attractive and suitable for mucosal application in contrast to the area of intranasal vaccination only a few recent studies have focused on pulmonary immunization and the involvement of the pulmonary immune system in eliciting protective immune responses against inhaled pathogens this review focuses on dna vaccine delivery to the lung as a promising approach to prevent pulmonaryassociated diseases caused by inhaled pathogens attractive immunological features of the lung as a site for immunization the mechanisms of action of dna vaccines and the pulmonary application of such vaccines using novel delivery systems will be discussed we also examine pulmonary diseases prone to prevention or therapeutical intervention by application of dna vaccines d
noroviruses are the leading cause of epidemic non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide despite their discovery over three decades ago little is known about the host immune response to norovirus infection the purpose of this chapter is to review the field of norovirus immunology and discuss the contributions of outbreak investigations human and animal challenge studies and population-based studies this chapter will survey both humoral and cellular immunity as well as recent advances in norovirus vaccine development nov belong to the family caliciviridae genus norovirus and are currently divided into five distinct genetic classifications called genogroups gi-v genogroups are
background ducks anas platyrhynchos an economically important waterfowl for meat eggs and feathers is also a natural reservoir for influenza a viruses the emergence of novel viruses is attributed to the status of co-existence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts for effective prediction of future viral epidemic or pandemic an in-depth understanding of the virome status in the key reservoir species is highly essential to obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks by viral metagenomic approach we deep sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks which shared the water bodies with wild migratory birds result in total 7455180 reads with average length of 146 bases were generated of which 7354300 reads were de novo assembled into 24945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100880 reads were singletons the duck virome were identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons blastx e score <10 −3 against viral reference database numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the papillomaviridae family and phages of the caudovirales inoviridae tectiviridae microviridae families and unclassified phages further several duck virome sequences had homologous with the insect viruses of the poxviridae alphatetraviridae baculoviridae densovirinae iflaviridae and dicistroviridae families and plant viruses of the secoviridae virgaviridae tombusviridae and partitiviridae families which reflects the diet and habitation of ducks this study increases our understanding of the viral diversity and expands the knowledge about the spectrum of viruses harboured in the enteric tract of ducks
a b s t r a c t astroviruses astv are single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses and one of the major causes of infant diarrhoea worldwide diarrhoea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves therefore we investigated whether the presence of astv is associated with calf diarrhoea we identified diverse astv lineages from faecal samples of both healthy and diarrhoeic calves and healthy adult cattle in south west scotland astv was common in calves present in 74% 85/115 of samples but uncommon in adult cattle present in 15% 3/20 of samples no association was found between the presence of astv and calf diarrhoea or the presence of a specific astv lineage and calf diarrhoea astv was strongly associated with the presence of rotavirus group a rva and a protective effect of age was evident for both astv and rva co-infections with multiple astv lineages were detected in several calves and serial infection with different viruses could also be seen by longitudinal sampling of individuals in summary our study found genotypically diverse astv in the faeces of calves in south west scotland however no association was identified between astv and calf diarrhoea which suggests the virus does not play a primary role in the aetiology of calf diarrhoea in the group studied
the aim of this study was to estimate in farmed european wild boars the prevalence of and risk factors associated with a range of common porcine viral and bacterial infections namely porcine parvovirus ppv porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 swine influenza virus siv aujeszky's disease virus adv classical swine fever virus csfv swine vesicular disease virus svdv coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis tgev porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv mycoplasma hyopneumoniae lawsonia intracellularis brucella spp and leptospira spp a sampling frame was compiled based on a national record of wild boar farmers and 32 farms were surveyed serological screening was carried out on 303 samples from animals slaughtered between 2005 and 2008 and random-effect logistic regression models were developed for pathogens with a 'non-zero' prevalence the apparent animal prevalence for ppv pcv2 and l intracellularis was 46.5% 95% confidence interval 41-52% 51.1% 95% ci 45-57% and 59.2% 95% ci 54-65% respectively apparent farm seroprevalence rates for ppv pcv2 and lawsonia intracellularis were 56.3% 95% ci 39-73% 21.9% 95% ci 8-36% and 78.1% 95% ci 64-92% respectively no antibodies were detected against siv adv csfv svdv tgev prssv leptospira spp brucella spp or m hyopneumoniae increasing herd size proximity to dense populations of domestic swine and later sampling times within the survey period were found to be risk factors overall the seroprevalence of these pathogens in farmed wild boar was similar to that in the farmed domestic pig population in finland however it is possible that the rearing of wild boars in fenced estates may predispose them to particular infections as reflected in higher antibody titres
besser t e mcguire t c and gay c c 1987 the transfer of serum igg1 antibody into the gastrointestinal tract in newborn calves vet immun hnmunopath 17 51-56 transfer of functional blood igg1 to the gastrointestinal tract was measured in neonatal calves radiolabelled immunoglobulin gi iggl anti-dnp antibody was administered to 2 day old calves by intravenous injection the serum clearance rate was measured and was compared to the rate of protein-bound 1251 excretion in the feces over a i0 day period to determine the importance of transfer to the gastrointestinal tract as a mechanism of serum iggl clearance the amount of protein-bound and dnp-binding 1251 present in the gastrointestinal tract of i0 day old calves at necropsy was also measured fecal excretion of protein-bound 1251 accounted for 32% of the serum 1251-1ggl clearance protein-bound 1251 was present in the gastrointestinal tract at necropsy in amounts estimated to account for 68% of the total 1251-1ggl clearance and retained 65z of the dnp-binding ability of the original antibody the discrepancy between the fecal excretion 32% of total igg1 clearance and the gi clearance estimated from protein-bound 1251 in the gut 68% of total igg1 clearance is explained in part by iggl proteolysis occurring after transfer to the gastrointestinal tract but before fecal excretion these results indicate that transfer to the calf gastrointestinal tract accounts for most iggl clearance in young calves and that the intestinal antibody retains antigen binding function and may contribute to intestinal immunity
hand foot and mouth disease hfmd is an important public health problem that has emerged over the past several years hfmd predominantly infects children under seven years old and occasionally causes severe disease in adults among the enteroviruses enterovirus 71 ev71 and coxsackievirus 16 ca16 are the major causative agents of hfmd in addition adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for hfmd in some cases here we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in china were tested for the presence of antibodies against ev71 ca16 adenovirus human serotype 5 adhu5 and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 adc7 using neutralization tests high seroprevalence rates of ev71 ca16 and adhu5 were found in the population 85.7% 58.8% and 74.2% respectively the coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% 154 of 391 with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80 40 and 640 respectively and the neutralizing antibody titer for ev71 was found to be correlated with those of ca16 and adhu5 adc7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population with a seropositivity rate of 11.8% suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development
although the original us porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was confirmed as highly virulent by multiple studies the virulence of spike-insertion deletion s-indel pedv strains is undefined in this study 3-4 day-old conventional suckling piglets were inoculated with s-indel pedv iowa106 4 pig litters to study its virulence two litters of agematched piglets were inoculated with either the original us pedv pc21a or mock as positive and negative controls respectively subsequently all pigs were challenged with the original us pedv pc21a on 21-29 days post-inoculation dpi to assess cross-protection all s-indel iowa106-and the original us pc21a-inoculated piglets developed diarrhea however the severity of clinical signs mortality 0-75% and fecal pedv rna shedding titers varied among the four s-indel iowa106-inoculated litters compared with the original pc21a piglets euthanized/died acutely from s-indel iowa106 infection had relatively milder villous atrophy lower antigen scores and more limited intestinal infection two of four s-indel iowa106-infected sows and the original pc21a-infected sow showed anorexia and watery diarrhea for 1-4 days after the original pc21a challenge a subset 13/16 of s-indel iowa106-inoculated piglets developed diarrhea whereas all 5/5 and no 0/4 pigs in the mock and original pc21a-inoculated pigs had diarrhea respectively our results suggest that the virulence of s-indel pedv iowa106 was less than the original us pedv pc21a in suckling pigs with 100% morbidity and 18% 6/33 overall 0-75% mortality in suckling pigs depending on factors such as the sow's health and lactation and the piglets' birth weight prior infection by s-indel iowa106 provided partial cross-protection to piglets against the original pc21a challenge at 21-29 dpi © 2015 lin et al this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http// creativecommons org/licenses/by/4.0/ which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made the creative commons public domain dedication waiver http//creativecommons org/publicdomain/
several arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever a severe disease with case-fatality rates in hospitalized individuals ranging from 15-30%. because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases niaid as top priority biodefense category a pathogens recombinant consensus interferon alpha cifn-a is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal however while cifn-a has great therapeutic value its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life mode and frequency of administration and costly production to address these limitations we describe the use of def201 a replicationdeficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cifn-a for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters intranasal administration of def201 24 h prior to challenge with pichindé virus picv was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease a significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of def201 given two weeks prior to picv challenge def201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure the protective effect of def201 was largely attributed to the expression of cifn-a as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal picv challenge effective countermeasures that are highly stable easily administered and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections the def201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens citation gowen bb ennis j russell a sefing ej wong m-h et al 2011 use of recombinant adenovirus vectored consensus ifn-a to avert severe arenavirus infection plos one 610 e26072
astrovirus infections cause gastroenteritis in mammals and have been identi fi ed as causative agents of diverse pathologies in birds such as hepatitis in ducks and poult enteritis mortality syndrome pems which causes enteritis and thymic and bursal atrophy in turkeys human astroviruses are recognized as the second leading cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide eight traditional astrovirus serotypes have been identi fi ed in humans but recently novel astrovirus strains isolated from humans have been associated with diseases other than gastroenteritis herein we summarize our current knowledge of the astrovirus life cycle though there are gaps in our understanding of astrovirus replication similarities can be drawn from picornaviridae and caliciviridae virus families there are however unique characteristics of the astrovirus life cycle including intracellular proteolytic processing of viral particles by cellular caspases which has been shown to be required for the maturation and exit of viral progeny
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is one of the most significant swine diseases worldwide despite its relevance serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection have not yet been identified surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry seldi-tof ms is a reproducible accurate and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum this work describes the seldi-tof ms analyses of sera of 60 prrsv-positive and 60 prrsv-negative as measured by pcr asymptomatic large white piglets at weaning sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin < 4.52 μg/ml were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1-200 kda were obtained with the cm10 imac30 and h50 surfaces results a total of 200 significant peaks p < 0.05 were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase the majority of peaks 42 were up-regulated in prrsv-positive piglets while 5 were down-regulated a panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 ph = 9 on the surface cm10 and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between prrsv-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73% respectively conclusions seldi-tof ms profiling of sera from prrsv-positive and prrsv-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of prrsv infection in weaning piglets furthermore seldi-tof protein markers represent a refined phenotype of prrsv infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies
a cost-effective and efficacious influenza vaccine for use in commercial poultry farms would help protect against avian influenza outbreaks current influenza vaccines for poultry are expensive and subtype specific and therefore there is an urgent need to develop a universal avian influenza vaccine we have constructed a live bacterial vaccine against avian influenza by expressing a conserved peptide from the ectodomain of m2 antigen m2e on the surface of lactococcus lactis ll chickens were vaccinated intranasally with the lactococcal vaccine ll-m2e or subcutaneously with keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin conjugated m2e klh-m2e vaccinated and nonvaccinated birds were challenged with high pathogenic avian influenza virus a subtype h5n2 birds vaccinated with ll-m2e or klh-m2e had median survival times of 5.5 and 6.0 days respectively which were significantly longer than non-vaccinated birds 3.5 days birds vaccinated subcutaneously with klh-m2e had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups however there was a significant correlation between the time of survival and m2e-specific serum igg the results of these trials show that birds in both vaccinated groups had significantly < 0.05 higher median survival times than non-vaccinated birds and that this protection could be due to m2e-specific serum igg
pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics live sars-cov-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on a vsv pseudovirus production system a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities the key parameters for this assay were optimized including cell types cell numbers virus inoculum when tested against the sars-cov-2 pseudovirus sars-cov-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency which underscore its potential as therapeutics the limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples the cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples respectively this assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra-and inter-assay analyses respectively taken together we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for sars-cov-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus
the continued emergence and re-emergence of pathogens represent an ongoing sometimes major threat to populations hantaviruses family bunyaviridae and their associated human diseases were considered to be confined to eurasia but the occurrence of an outbreak in 1993-94 in the southwestern united states led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described the large majority since 1993 and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts and in the americas human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome hcps with case-fatality ratios for the most common viral serotypes between 30% and 40%. habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances perhaps including climate change are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of hcps between 1993 and the present we consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity
previous studies have reported that a prokaryotic-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid protein np is a suitable reagent for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus infection in this study soluble recombinant human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 np was produced to examine the antigenicity of the hcov-oc43 np of betacoronavirus using the purified recombinant np as an antigen a polyclonal antibody from rabbit serum with specificity for hcov-oc43 np was generated this antibody reacts specifically with hcov-oc43 np and does not cross-react with other human cov nps including those of sars-cov and hcov-229e by western blot sera from 26 young adults 17 middle-aged and elderly patients with respiratory infection and 15 cord blood samples were also tested strong reactivity to the nps of hcov-oc43 was observed in 96% 82% and 93% of the serum samples from the young adults respiratory patients and cord blood samples respectively to identify the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of the np that are recognised by the rabbit polyclonal antibody and human serum the antigenicities of three protein fragments including the n-terminal domain aa 1-173 the central-linker region aa 174-300 and the c-terminal domain aa 301-448 were evaluated by western blot the rabbit polyclonal antibody demonstrated greater immunoreactivity to the central-linker region and the c-terminal domain than to the n-terminal domain three different patterns for the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of hcov-oc43 np were observed in human serum suggesting variability in the immune responses that occur during hcov-oc43 infection in humans the central-linker region of the np appeared to be the most highly immunoreactive region for all three patterns observed the goal of this study was to offer insight into the design of diagnostic tools for hcov infection
although the cause of multiple sclerosis ms is not known an immunologic process is generally considered to be an important element in the pathogenesis of the disease.'evidence of an immunologic mechanism is however circumstantial the perivenular inflammatory response comprised of lymphocytes and monocytes is certainly consistent with an immunologically mediated disease and resembles the pathologic changes seen in postvaccinal encephalomyelitis a disease of certain immunologic cause the similarities between ms and a model of immunopathologic disease of the central nervous system cns experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae also supports a similar mechanism in ms the objections to the appropriateness of eae as a model for ms have been partially overcome by the demonstration of an experimentally produced relapsing remitting disease with close pathologic similarities to ms.2 the relationship between ms and eae remains uncertain but it is clear that the induction of ms is considerably more complex further support for an immunologic mechanism in ms comes from the demonstration of abnormalities of immunoglobulin ig and lymphocyte populations and function in the disease alterations in cerebrospinal fluid csf ig represent the most consistent immunologic changes described in ms which reflects their diagnostic importance the increased levels of ig largely synthesized locally in the csf' and the oligoclonal nature of this ig4 have led to the contention that ms may be directly related to antibody reactivity with components of myelin despite extensive investigations a clear association between csf ig reactivity and the disease has not been established increased antibody levels to numerous viruses have been found and in each case they represent a small fraction of the ig present small amounts of antibody to myelin components have been described but again it is unlikely that these antibodies are directly or singularly responsible for the demyelinati~n.~ an alternative explanation for the increased ig with multiple specificities is that it merely reflects the specificities of b cells or plasma cells that have migrated into the inflammatory sites within the cns the antibody specificities found in the csf in ms are generally those found in high titers in the serum this finding suggests that b cells with these specificities have a relatively high precursor frequency and if circulating would have a greater chance of migrating into an inflammatory site by chance although their accumulation may be random the conditions permitting their differentiation into ig-producing cells must be present within the cns because the oligoclonal ig pattern found in the csf is often relatively constant over time it seems likely that some b-cell populations or clones are maintained and undergo continued differentiation within the cns generally differentiation and ig production require two signals one of which is the perturbation of the ig antigen receptor if the antigens 99
the goal of this work was to test the efficacy of the vaccination with trypanosoma rangeli in dogs mongrel dogs received three subcutaneous injections of fixed t rangeli epimastigotes at 6-week intervals such immunisation induced antibodies against trypanosoma cruzi while both control and immunised dogs developed detectable parasitemia this was lower and shorter in vaccinated animals interestingly feeding of triatoma infestans nymphs on vaccinated and chronically infected dogs led to a sharp reduction in the rate of bug infection these results suggest that it might be possible to reduce the vectorial parasitemia through vaccination of dogs as dogs are known to play a major role in the domestic cycle of t cruzi this might represent a strategy to reduce parasite transmission to humans
clinical progress in the field of her2-positive breast cancer therapy has been dramatically improved by understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms of tumor microenvironment passive immunotherapy utilizing recombinant monoclonal antibodies mabs particularly trastuzumab and pertuzumab has proved to be an effective strategy in her2-positive breast cancer treatment however resistance to mab therapy and relapse of disease are still considered important challenges in clinical practice there are increasing reports on the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses in her2-positive breast cancer patients more recently increasing efforts are focused on using her2-derived peptide vaccines for active immunotherapy here we discuss the development of various her2-derived vaccines tested in animal models and human clinical trials different formulations and strategies to improve immunogenicity of the antigens in animal studies are also discussed furthermore other immunotherapeutic approaches to her2 breast cancer including ctla-4 inhibitors immune checkpoint inhibitors anti pd-1/pd-l1 antibodies are presented
background the urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype h1n1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian h5n1 viruses and indeed the evolving swine-origin h1n1 influenza pandemic a recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses including h1 h2 h5 h6 and h9 subtypes has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class methodology/principal findings we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody cr6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian h5n1 virus in ferrets the optimal model of human influenza infection survival rates clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract as well as macro-and microscopic pathology were investigated prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg cr6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9% abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented h5n1-induced lung pathology when administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge 30 mg/kg cr6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise reduced lung viral loads and shedding and less lung damage conclusions/significance these data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza
background there is an urgent need for an effective vaccine to control and eradicate malaria one of the most serious global infectious diseases plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 msp4 has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria infection with plasmodium ovale species including p ovale wallikeri and p ovale curtisi is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other plasmodium species however little is known about p ovale msp4 the msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic dna extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with p ovale spp and amplified products were sequenced open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of p ovale curtisi msp4 pocmsp4 and p ovale wallikeri msp4 powmsp4 respectively were selected for protein expression recombinant proteins rpomsp4 were expressed in escherichia coli purified analysed and immunized in balb/c mice the specificity of anti-msp4-immunoglobulin ig g antibodies was evaluated by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays results full peptide sequences of pocmsp4 and powmsp4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one p o wallikeri isolate further truncated pomsp4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kda proteins importantly high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 110000 to 12560000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed with high igg avidity to pocmsp4 80.5% and powmsp4 92.3%. furthermore rpoc-msp4 and rpowmsp4 cross-reacted with anti-powmsp4-specific or anti-pocmsp4-specific antibodies additionally anti-pomsp4 igg antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rpomsp1 and rpoama1 lastly pocmsp4-and powmsp4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with pocmsp4 36% and powmsp4 cells 15.8% during splenocyte proliferation assays conclusion findings from this study suggest conservation in pomsp4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rpomsp4 furthermore induction of immune responses in pocmsp4-and powmsp4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for pomsp4 in protection
estimation of pathogen-specific causes of child diarrhea deaths is needed to guide vaccine development and other prevention strategies we did a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting at least one of 13 pathogens in children 5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea we included 2011 rotavirus data from the rotavirus surveillance network coordinated by who we excluded studies conducted during diarrhea outbreaks that did not discriminate between inpatient and outpatient cases reporting nosocomial infections those conducted in special populations not done with adequate methods and rotavirus studies in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was used age-adjusted median proportions for each pathogen were calculated and applied to 712 000 deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years for 2011 assuming that those observed among children hospitalized for diarrhea represent those causing child diarrhea deaths 163 articles and who studies done in 31 countries were selected representing 286 inpatient studies studies seeking only one pathogen found higher proportions for some pathogens than studies seeking multiple pathogens e g 39% rotavirus in 180 single-pathogen studies vs 20% in 24 studies with 5-13 pathogens p00001 the percentage of episodes for which no pathogen could be identified was estimated to be 34% the total of all age-adjusted percentages for pathogens and no-pathogen cases was 138%. adjusting all proportions including unknowns to add to 100% we estimated that rotavirus caused 197 000 enteropathogenic e coli 79 000 ur 31 000-146 000 calicivirus 71 000 ur 39 000-113 000 and enterotoxigenic e coli 42 000 ur 20 000-76 000 deaths rotavirus calicivirus enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic e coli cause more than half of all diarrheal deaths in children 5 years in the world
nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes severe febrile encephalitis resulting in death in 40% to 75% of human cases nipah virus is considered a biosafety level-4 pathogen and is listed as a select agent with high risk for public health and security due to its high mortality rate in people and the lack of effective vaccines or therapies the natural reservoir for nipah virus and related members of the genus henipavirus are fruit bats of the genus pteropus nipah virus emerged in malaysia in 1998 as a porcine neurologic and respiratory disease that spread to humans who had contact with live infected pigs research reviewed in this paper suggests that anthropogenic factors including agricultural expansion and intensification were the underlying causes of its emergence nipah virus has caused five subsequent outbreaks between 2001 and 2005 in bangladesh here it appears to have spilled over directly from bats to humans and person-to-person transmission is evident suggesting a heightened public health risk
human interaction with animals has been implicated as a primary risk factor for several high impact zoonoses including many bat-origin viral diseases however the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood to investigate this phenomenon we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in yunnan guangxi and guangdong districts of southern china where we have identified a number of sars-related coronaviruses in bats serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk a total of 1596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017 nine participants 0.6% tested positive for bat coronaviruses 265 17% participants reported severe acute respiratory infections sari and/or influenza-like illness ili symptoms in the past year which were associated with poultry carnivore rodent/shrew or bat contact with variability by family income and district of residence this study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in southern china the low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event nonetheless this study highlights associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk these findings can be used to support targeted biological behavioral surveillance in high-risk geographic areas in order to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence
adjuvants potentiate antigen-specific protective immune responses and can be key elements promoting vaccine effectiveness we previously reported that the onchocerca volvulus recombinant protein rov-asp-1 can induce activation and maturation of naïve human dcs and therefore could be used as an innate adjuvant to promote balanced th1 and th2 responses to bystander vaccine antigens in mice with a few vaccine antigens it also promoted a th1-biased response based on pronounced induction of th1-associated igg2a and igg2b antibody responses and the upregulated production of th1 cytokines including il-2 ifn-c tnf-a and il-6 however because it is a protein the rov-asp-1 adjuvant may also induce anti-self-antibodies therefore it was important to verify that the host responses to self will not affect the adjuvanticity of rov-asp-1 when it is used in subsequent vaccinations with the same or different vaccine antigens in this study we have established rov-asp-1's adjuvanticity in mice during the course of two sequential vaccinations using two vaccine model systems the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike protein and a commercial influenza virus hemagglutinin ha vaccine comprised of three virus strains moreover the adjuvanticity of rov-asp-1 was retained with an efficacy similar to that obtained when it was used for a first vaccination even though a high level of anti-rov-asp-1 antibodies was present in the sera of mice before the administration of the second vaccine to further demonstrate its utility as an adjuvant for human use we also immunized non-human primates nhps with rbd plus rov-asp-1 and showed that rov-asp-1 could induce high titres of functional and protective anti-rbd antibody responses in nhps notably the rov-asp-1 adjuvant did not induce high titer antibodies against self in nhps thus the present study provided a sound scientific foundation for future strategies in the development of this novel protein adjuvant
avian paramyxoviruses apmv serotypes 1-9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds worldwide apmv-1 also called newcastle disease virus ndv is attenuated in non-human primates and is being developed as a candidate human vaccine vector the vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown in the present study we evaluated nine different biologically-or recombinantly-derived apmv strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model five of the viruses were biologically-derived wild type wt apmv-2 -3 -5 -7 and -9 another virus was a recombinant r version of wt apmv-4 the remaining three viruses were versions of wt rapmv-2 -4 and -7 in which the f cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract and seroconversion virus shedding was not detected for wt apmv-5 very limited shedding was detected for wt rapmv-4 and modified rapmv-4 and only in a subset of animals shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract in particular shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rapmv-2 wt apmv-7 and modified rapmv-7 modification of the f protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rapmv-2 and marginally by wt rapmv-4 all apmvs except wt apmv-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals none of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs these results indicate that apmvs 2 3 4 7 and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates but are moderately-to-highly restricted depending on the serotype this suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry the virus infects pigs of all ages but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality currently available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing pedv infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory iga and igg antibody secreting b cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of pedv-infected sows and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma oral fluid and feces is important therefore our goal in this study was to quantify pedv specific iga and igg b cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds including parity one and higher sows our data indicated that evaluation of both pedv specific iga and igg antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid but not feces samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis pedv specific b cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection in conclusion in sows infected with pedv the presence of effector/memory b cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months postinfection suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses © 2015 ouyang et al this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http//creativecommons org/licenses/by/4.0/ which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made the creative commons public domain dedication waiver http//creativecommons org/ publicdomain/zero/1.0/ applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated

background human bocavirus hbov was recently described as a new member of the parvoviridae family and its possible association with respiratory illness in infants has been discussed to date hbov genomes have been detected worldwide in respiratory tract samples obtained from children with pulmonary diseases whereas only limited data on virus-specific immunity are available mainly because of the lack of recombinant viral antigens methods hbov viruslike particles vlps were produced in insect cells and characterized by electron microscopy and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation hbov viral protein 2 vp2-specific antibodies and cd4 ϩ t helper cell responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay and enzyme-linked immunospot assay results vp2 capsid proteins of hbov were produced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus and the formation of icosahedral vlps diameter 21-25 nm sedimentation density 1.33 g/cm 3 was demonstrated a significant increase in secretion of vp2-specific interferon-␥ was detected in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 69 healthy adults found to be positive for hbov-specific immunoglobulin g antibodies compared with control stimulations in parallel t cell responses against identically expressed parvovirus b19 vp2 vlps were frequently observed in the individuals studied without there being obvious cross-reactions between hbov and parvovirus b19 conclusions data suggest the presence of hbov-specific immune responses in adults and strongly support a high prevalence of hbov among humans
the interest in broad-range anti-influenza a monoclonal antibodies mabs has recently been strengthened by the identification of anti-hemagglutinin ha mabs endowed with heterosubtypic neutralizing activity to be used in the design of ''universal'' prophylactic or therapeutic tools however the majority of the single mabs described to date do not bind and neutralize viral isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes clustering into the two different ha-based influenza phylogenetic groups the group 1 including among others subtypes h1 h2 h5 and h9 and the group 2 including among others h3 subtype here we describe a human mab named pn-sia28 capable of binding and neutralizing all tested isolates belonging to phylogenetic group 1 including h1n1 h2n2 h5n1 and h9n2 subtypes and several isolates belonging to group 2 including h3n2 isolates from the first period of the 1968 pandemic therefore pn-sia28 is capable of neutralizing isolates belonging to subtypes responsible of all the reported pandemics as well as other subtypes with pandemic potential the region recognized by pn-sia28 has been identified on the stem region of ha and includes residues highly conserved among the different influenza subtypes a deep characterization of pn-sia28 features may represent a useful help in the improvement of available anti-influenza therapeutic strategies and can provide new tools for the development of universal vaccinal strategies
pathogen surveillance in free-ranging carnivores presents challenges due to their low densitie and secretive nature we combined molecular and serological assays to investigate infections by viral pathogens canine parvovirus cpv canine distemper virus cdv and canine coronavirus ccov in portuguese carnivores canis lupus vulpes vulpes lutra lutra martes foina m martes meles meles and genetta genetta over a period of 16 years additionally we explored spatio-temporal patterns of virus occurrence in canis lupus our study identified cpv dna in all carnivore species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 %. cpv was detected in all sampled years and seasons in canis lupus supporting its enzootic nature cdv rna was mainly detected in the canidae family with viral nucleic acid recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a peak prevalence of 67 % among the wolf population followed by a sharp decline suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus antibodies show that mustelids and viverrids were often exposed to cdv ccov was first recorded by molecular methods in wolf samples in 2002 remaining in the wolf populations with marked fluctuations over time the dual serological and molecular approach provided important epidemiological data on pathogens of wild carnivores in portugal these programmes should also include monitoring of other potential reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs
the variable region genes of a murine anti-coronavirus monoclonal antibody mab were joined by assembly polymerase chain reaction and expressed in escherichia coli in a single chain variable fragment scfv configuration after induction of expression the expected 32-kda protein was identified by western immunoblotting with specific rabbit anti-idiotype antibodies the scfv fragments were purified from soluble cytoplasmic preparations by affinity chromatography on nickel agarose which was possible with an n-terminal but not with a c-terminal histidine tag purified scfv fragments retained the antigen-binding properties of the parental antibody could inhibit its binding to viral antigens with apparently higher efficiency than monovalent antigen-binding fab fragments but neutralized viral infectivity with lower efficiency about sevenfold at a molar level to evaluate the usefulness of these smaller and less immunogenic molecules in the treatment of viral diseases mice were treated with purified recombinant scfv fragments and challenged with a lethal viral dose a small delay in mortality was observed for the scfv-treated animals therefore even though the scfv could neutralize viral infectivity in vitro the same quantity of fragments that partially protected mice in the form of fab only slightly delayed virus-induced lethality when injected as scfv fragments probably because of a much faster in vivo clearance the biologic half-life was estimated to be about 6 min since a scfv derived from a highly neutralizing and protective mab is only marginally effective in the passive protection of mice from lethal viral infection the use of such reagents for viral immunotherapy will require strategies to overcome stability limitations
the major structural protein vp2 of porcine parvovirus ppv was used as the model parvovirus antigen which has been expressed in lactobacillus casei fusing with escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit ltb as mucosal adjuvant the vp2-ltb dna fragment was cloned into vector ppg611 or ppg612 to generated inducible surface-displayed and secretion expression systems based on xylose promoter designated as rlcppg611-vp2-ltb recombinant l casei and rlcppg612-vp2-ltb respectively expression of the fusion protein was verified by sds-page western blot immunofluorescence and electron microscopy it was observed that the level of igg or siga from mice orally immunized with vp2-ltb was higher than that from mice received vp2 and negative control which demonstrated significantly statistically different especially the titer of igg or siga in mice immunized with rlcppg612-vp2-ltb is the highest in this study in summary ltb as mucosal adjuvant was able to effectively facilitate induction of mucosal and systemic immunity by l casei-expressing vp2 fusion protein
cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main causes of diarrhea in neonatal calves resulting in significant morbidity and economic losses for producers worldwide we have previously demonstrated efficacy of a new class of antimicrobial antibody fusions in a neonatal mouse model for c parvum infection here we extend efficacy testing of these products to experimental infection in calves the principal target species neonatal calves were challenged with c parvum oocysts and concomitantly treated with antibody-biocide fusion 4h9-g1-ll37 over the course of four days this resulted in reduced severity of the disease when compared to control animals overall clinical health parameters showed significant improvement in treated animals oocyst shedding was reduced in treated when compared to control animals control of oocyst shedding is a prerequisite for breaking the cycle of re-infection on dairy farms antibody-biocide fusion products thus have the potential to reduce the impact of the infection in both individual animals and in the herd

when pathogens become airborne they travel associated with particles of different size and composition particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen despite the importance of this information the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown in this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza a virus iav porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer μm in diameter air samples collected for the first 9 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for iav prrsv and pedv respectively using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr and quantified as geometric mean copies/m 3 within each size range iav was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10 2 in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1μm to 4.3x10 5 rna copies/ m 3 in the largest particles 9.0-10.0μm prrsv was detected in all size ranges except particles between 0.7 and 2.1μm in quantities ranging from 6x10 2 0.4-0.7μm to 5.1x10 4 rna copies/m 3 9.0-10.0μm pedv an enteric virus was detected in all particle sizes and in higher quantities than iav and prrsv p < 0.0001 ranging from 1.3x10 6 0.4-0.7μm to 3.5x10 8 rna copies/m 3 9.0-10.0μm infectious status was demonstrated for the 3 viruses and in the case of iav and prrsv viruses were isolated from particles larger than 2.1μm in summary our results indicated that airborne pedv iav and prrsv can be found in a wide range of particle sizes however virus viability is particle size dependent fig 3 total airborne particles distribution distribution of total airborne particles geometric mean of number of particles/m 3 and 95% confident interval measured using an optical particle counter

human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv two members of the pneumoviridae family account for the majority of severe lower respiratory tract infections worldwide in very young children they are also a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunocompromised adults high levels of neutralizing antibodies mostly directed against the viral fusion f glycoprotein correlate with protection against either hrsv or hmpv however no cross-neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified f proteins based on crystal structures of hrsv f and hmpv f we designed chimeric f proteins in which certain residues of well-characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens the antigenic changes were monitored by elisa with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross-neutralizing antibody responses and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site these results provide a proof of principle for chimeric fusion proteins as single immunogens that can induce cross-neutralizing antibody and protective responses against more than one human pneumovirus
we studied the immunogenicity of a dna sars-vaccine a whole killed virus or a whole killed and dna vaccine combination the dna vaccine contained a plasmid encoding the sars coronavirus sars-cov s protein under the control of the human cmv promoter and intron a the whole killed virus vaccine was comprised of sars-cov propagated in vero-e6 cells with subsequent ␤-propilactone inactivation and formulated with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant mice immunized twice with the dna vaccine and once with the whole killed virus elicited higher antibody responses than mice immunized three times with the dna vaccine or once with the whole killed virus vaccine mice immunized twice with the whole killed virus vaccine elicited higher antibody responses than mice immunized three times with the dna vaccine or once with the whole killed virus vaccine however a combination of the vaccines induced t-helper type 1 th1 immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induced t helper type 2 th2 immune response these results demonstrate that combination of the dna vaccine and the whole killed virus vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude and change the bias of the immune responses to sars-cov
demands for effective vaccines to control parasitic diseases of humans and livestock have been recently exacerbated by the development of resistance of most pathogenic parasites to anti-parasitic drugs novel genomic and proteomic technologies have provided opportunities for the discovery and improvement of dna vaccines which are relatively easy as well as cheap to fabricate and stable at room temperatures however their main limitation is rather poor immunogenicity which makes it necessary to couple the antigens with adjuvant molecules this paper review recent advances in the development of dna vaccines to some pathogenic protozoa and helminths numerous studies were conducted over the past 14 years of 21 st century employing various administration techniques adjuvants and new immunogenic antigens to increase efficacy of dna vaccines unfortunately the results have not been rewarding further research is necessary using more extensive combinations of antigens alternate delivery systems and more efficient adjuvants based on knowledge of the immunomodulatory capacities of parasitic protozoa and helminths

primary biliary cirrhosis pbc is an autoimmune disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct destruction and the production of anti-mitochondrial antibodies ama the absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease previous work has suggested that sjl/j mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc-e2 the major mitochondrial autoantigen of pbc leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis we hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of ifn-g injections accordingly sjl/j mice were immunized with pdc-e2 and for purpose of control a-casein subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous ifn-g as expected mice immunized with pdc-e2 with or without ifn-g developed high titer amas in contrast mice immunized with a-casein develop antinuclear antibodies more importantly the livers from mice immunized with pdc-e2 and/or those immunized with a-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts irrespective of bile duct size indeed there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis thus autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific
memory b cells that are generated during an infection or following vaccination act as sentinels to guard against future infections upon repeat antigen exposure memory b cells differentiate into new antibody-secreting plasma cells to provide rapid and sustained protection some pathogens evade or suppress the humoral immune system or induce memory b cells with a diminished ability to differentiate into new plasma cells this leaves the host vulnerable to chronic or recurrent infections single cell approaches coupled with next generation antibody gene sequencing facilitate a detailed analysis of the pathogen-specific memory b cell repertoire monoclonal antibodies that are generated from antibody gene sequences allow a functional analysis of the repertoire this review discusses what has been learned thus far from analysis of diverse pathogen-specific memory b cell compartments and describes major differences in their repertoires such information may illuminate ways to advance the goal of improving vaccine and therapeutic antibody design
ferrets are widely used as a small animal model for a number of viral infections including influenza a virus and sars coronavirus to further analyze the microbiological status of ferrets their fecal viral flora was studied using a metagenomics approach novel viruses from the families picorna- papilloma- and anelloviridae as well as known viruses from the families astro- corona- parvo- and hepeviridae were identified in different ferret cohorts ferret kobu-and hepatitis e virus were mainly present in human household ferrets whereas coronaviruses were found both in household as well as farm ferrets our studies illuminate the viral diversity found in ferrets and provide tools to prescreen for newly identified viruses that potentially could influence disease outcome of experimental virus infections in ferrets
engineering vaccine-based therapeutics for infectious diseases is highly challenging as trial formulations are often found to be nonspecific ineffective thermally or hydrolytically unstable and/or toxic vaccines have greatly improved the therapeutic landscape for treating infectious diseases and have significantly reduced the threat by therapeutic and preventative approaches furthermore the advent of recombinant technologies has greatly facilitated growth within the vaccine realm by mitigating risks such as virulence reversion despite making the production processes more cumbersome in addition seroconversion can also be enhanced by recombinant technology through kinetic and nonkinetic approaches which are discussed herein recombinant technologies have greatly improved both amino acid-based vaccines and dna-based vaccines a plateau of interest has been reached between 2001 and 2010 for the scientific community with regard to dna vaccine endeavors the decrease in interest may likely be attributed to difficulties in improving immunogenic properties associated with dna vaccines although there has been research demonstrating improvement and optimization to this end despite improvement to the extent of our knowledge there are currently no regulatory body-approved dna vaccines for human use four vaccines approved for animal use this article discusses engineering dna vaccines against infectious diseases while discussing advantages and disadvantages of each with an emphasis on applications of these dna vaccines this review paper summarizes the state of the engineered/recombinant dna vaccine field with a scope entailing ''engineering dna vaccines against infectious diseases". we endeavor to emphasize recent advances recapitulating the current state of the field in addition to discussing dna therapeutics that have already been clinically translated this review also examines current research developments and the challenges thwarting further progression our review covers recombinant dna-based subunit vaccines internalization and processing enhancing immune protection via adjuvants manufacturing and engineering dna the safety stability and delivery of dna vaccines or plasmids controlling gene expression using plasmid engineering and gene circuits overcoming immunogenic issues and commercial successes we hope that this review will inspire further research in dna vaccine development
immune responses against multiple epitopes are required for the prevention of hepatitis c virus hcv infection and the progression to phase i trials of candidates may be guided by comparative immunogenicity studies in non-human primates four vectors dna sfv human serotype 5 adenovirus huad5 and modified vaccinia ankara mva poxvirus all expressing hepatitis c virus core e1 e2 and ns3 were combined in three prime-boost regimen and their ability to elicit immune responses against hcv antigens in rhesus macaques was explored and compared all combinations induced specific t-cell immune responses including high ifn-γ production the group immunized with the sfv+mva regimen elicited higher e2-specific responses as compared with the two other modalities while animals receiving huad5 injections elicited lower il-4 responses as compared with those receiving mva the ifn-γ responses to ns3 were remarkably similar between groups only the adenovirus induced envelope-specific antibody responses but these failed to show neutralizing activity therefore the two novel regimens failed to induce superior responses as compared with already existing hcv vaccine candidates differences were found in response to envelope proteins but the relevance of these remain uncertain given the surprisingly poor correlation with immunogenicity data in chimpanzees underlining the difficulty to predict efficacy from immunology studies
infectious diseases may be particularly critical for the conservation of endangered species a striking example is the recurrent outbreaks that have been occurring in seabirds on amsterdam island for the past 30 years threatening populations of three endangered seabird species and of the endemic critically endangered amsterdam albatross diomedea amsterdamensis the bacteria pasteurella multocida avian cholera causative agent and to a lesser extent erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae erysipelas causative agent were both suspected to be responsible for these epidemics despite this critical situation demographic trends were not available for these threatened populations and the occurrence and characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known the aims of the current study were to i provide an update of population trends for four threatened seabird species monitored on amsterdam island ii assess the occurrence of p multocida and e rhusiopathiae in live birds from five species iii search for other infectious agents in these samples and iv isolate and genotype the causative agents of epizooties from dead birds our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially in three seabird species during the past decade with extremely low reproductive success and declining populations for indian yellow-nosed albatrosses thalassarche carteri sooty albatrosses phoebetria fusca and northern rockhopper penguins eudyptes moseleyi pasteurella multocida or e rhusiopathiae were detected by pcr in live birds of all five investigated species while results were negative for eight additional infectious agents a single strain of p multocida was repeatedly cultured from dead birds while no e rhusiopathiae could be isolated these results highlight the significance of p multocida in this particular eco-epidemiological system as the main agent responsible for epizootics the study stresses the urgent need to implement mitigation measures to alter the course of avian plos one | https//doi org/10.1371/journal pone.0197291 may 30 2018 1 / 17 open access citation jaeger a lebarbenchon c bourret v bastien m lagadec e thiebot j-b et al 2018 avian cholera outbreaks threaten seabird species on amsterdam island plos one 135 e0197291
background streptococcus equi subspecies equi infection elicits m protein antibody titers in equids interpretation of titers is not generally accepted hypothesis the magnitude of s equi m protein sem antibody titer after infection titer ≥112 800 will be useful to monitor for the presence of complications or the risk of development of complications animals forty-eight horses on 1 farm involved in strangles outbreak methods clinical and observational study s equi m protein antibody titers were measured on all horses 8 weeks after infection and select horses 12 and 28 weeks after infection horses were categorized no disease uncomplicated case persistent guttural pouch gp infection or complicated cases metastatic abscesses purpura hemorrhagica secondary infections and dysphagia category was compared to titer results twenty-eight of 48 58% developed clinical signs of s equi infection of those 11 39% had uncomplicated strangles 9 21% had persistent gp infection 5 18% were complicated cases and 3 11% had both persistent gp infection and complications thirty-three percent of horses 16 of 48 had sem antibody titers ≥112 800 eight weeks after infection of horses with titers ≥112 800 6 of 16 had evidence of complications of complicated cases 6 of 8 had titers ≥112 800 in this outbreak the sensitivity 75% 95% ci 45-105 for a sem antibody titer ≥112 800 detecting complications was higher than the specificity 43% 95% ci 23-64 conclusions and clinical importance this outbreak demonstrates that sem antibody titers can be increased after infection ≥112 800 in the absence of complications of strangles
six vaccination regimes using classical mass-type and variant ib-var2 and ib-793b live vaccines were evaluated against middle eastern variant-2 infectious bronchitis virus challenge six groups of spf chicks 30 birds/group were vaccinated using prime-boost regimes at day-1 and day-14 using ib-m41ib-var2 ib-var2ib-var2 ib-var2ib-m41 ib-ma5ib-793b ib-793bib-793b and ib-793bib-ma5 respectively ciliostasis and lesion scores were evaluated at day-5 after each vaccination birds were challenged intranasally at 14-day post 2nd vaccination using 10 5 eid 50 /0.1 ml/bird of wild-type ibv eg/1212b/2012 at 3 5 and 7-day post challenge dpc virus shedding was monitored by real-time rt-pcr five chicks/group were euthanized at 7dpc for ciliostasis and lesion scoring and histopathology was conducted on 3 chicks/group seroconversion was evaluated at 14 dpc all groups primed with the 793b vaccine showed relatively higher ciliostasis scores compared to other groups the ib-var2 vaccinated groups showed the highest protection rates 80-100% and high protection score 67.6-73.2% compared to the 793b vaccine groups 50-60%. the virus shedding was significantly reduced at 3 and 5dpc in groups received the ibv-var2 prime or booster compared to those received the 793b vaccine in conclusion the homologous ibv-var2 vaccine showed superior results compared to 793b or mass-type vaccines confirming the importance of ibv vaccine seed homology to the circulating ibv strains
we previously developed a respiratory tract vaccine candidate against ebola virus ebov based on human parainfluenza virus type 3 hpiv3 a respiratory paramyxovirus expressing the ebov gp envelope protein hpiv3/gp from an added gene two doses of this vaccine candidate delivered by the intranasal and intratracheal route protected monkeys against intraperitoneal challenge with ebov however concerns exist that the vaccine candidate may have reduced immunogenicity in the adult human population due to pre-existing immunity against hpiv3 here we developed a new vaccine candidate ndv/gp based on newcastle disease virus ndv an avian paramyxovirus that is antigenically distinct from human viral pathogens and is highly attenuated in monkeys following one intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with ndv/gp titers of ebov-specific antibodies in respiratory tract secretions and serum samples determined by elisa as well as serum ebov-neutralizing antibodies were undetectable or low compared to those induced by hpiv3/gp a second immunization resulted in a substantial boost in serum igg elisa titers yet the titers remained lower than those induced by a second dose of hpiv3/gp in contrast the elisa iga titers in respiratory tract secretions and more importantly the serum ebovneutralizing antibody titers were equal to those induced after the second dose of hpiv3/gp these data suggest that ndv/gp can be effective for immunization against ebov alone or in combination with either hpiv3/gp or another vaccine platform in a heterologous prime-boost regimen
the detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics yet many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking given this we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis sera a method to rapidly discover conserved pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes and applied it to develop an assay for chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing ngs thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate chagas antigens in a blinded validation set n = 72 30/30 chagas were positive 30/30 non-chagas were negative and 1/12 leishmania sp was positive after unblinding a leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel the chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity 30/30 and specificity 90/90 in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown chagas serostatus assay specificity was 99.8% 998/1000 thus the chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity ngs-based serology via sera provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays
despite the importance of buffalo farming in iran little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of eimeria spp in the animal species the present study was designed to investigate the prevalence and species characterization of eimeria oocysts in river buffalo calves of khuzestan province southwest of iran of the total 108 fecal samples examined for eimeria 108 100% were found infected with 11 species of the parasite among the identified species of eimeria e bovis was found to be the predominant etiological agent 76.85% followed in order by e canadensis 62.96% e zuernii 47.2% e ellipsoidalis 26.85% e subspherica 25.92% e brasiliensis 19.4% e auburnensis 18.51% e alabamensis 14.81% e pellita 11.1% e illinoisensis 5.5% and e bukidnonensis 2.7%. in most calves multiple infections with three species were present while 20.7% of calves showed heavy infection 50.4 and 24.8% of calves showed weak and moderate infection respectively there was no significant difference in the opg values between the calves of different localities there was also no significant difference between the prevalence rate of infection in males and females a total of 16.6% of all faecal samples were found to be diarrheic a highly significant relationship could be identified between the occurrence of diarrhea and the level of e bovis and e zuernii oocysts excretion considering the pervasive occurrence and negative effects of the infection on the health condition and the growth performance of buffalo calves infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians
pathogens in general and pathogenic viruses in particular have evolved a myriad of mechanisms to escape the immune response of mammalian species viruses that cause acute disease tend to bear characteristics that make them very contagious as survival does not derive from chronicity of infection but spread of disease throughout the herd foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv is one of the most contagious viruses known upon infection of susceptible species cloven-hoofed animals the virus proliferates rapidly and causes a vesicular disease within 2-4 days disease symptoms resolve by 10 days to 2 weeks and in most cases virus can no longer be detected periods of fever and viremia are usually brief 1-3 days in vivo control of virus infection and clearance of the virus during and following acute infection is of particular interest the interaction of this virus with cells mediating the early innate immune response has been analyzed in a number of recent studies in most reports the virus has a distinct inhibitory effect on the response of cells early in infection here we review these new data and discuss the dynamics of the interaction of virus with different cell types mediating the immune response to infection
the occurrence of homologous recombination in influenza viruses has been under some debate recently to determine the extent of homologous recombination in influenza c virus recombination analyses of all available gene sequences of influenza c virus were carried out no recombination signal was found with the previous evidence in influenza a and b viruses it seems that homologous recombination has minimal or no effect on influenza virus evolution
rotavirus diarrhea is a major cause of infantile gastroenteritis worldwide this review is mainly devoted to the effects of rotavirus on intestinal epithelial transport and to the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to underlie the intestinal fluid secretion caused by the virus
background porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped is an emergent/re-emergent viral pig disease caused by the virus belonging to the coronaviridae family in specific the alphacoronavirus genus of global importance clinical presentation is characterized with acute diarrhoea vomiting and dehydration in pigs of all ages with a possible high mortality in suckling piglets the disease emerged in the usa in 2013 causing heavy losses and re-emerged in europe in 2014 but with milder consequences results in the spring 2016 ped-like symptoms were reported to be seen on an agricultural holding in eastern croatia laboratory workup confirmed the croatia's first ped outbreak ever porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv strain responsible for the outbreak was of the s-indel genotype much the same as other european pedv strains in 2017 a post-outbreak serology was carried out in three counties in eastern croatia revealing seropositivity in pigs bred on four large industrial holdings 9.09%. the seroprevalence across pedv-positive holdings was up to 82.8%. the latter holdings were unanimously managed by an enterprise that had never reported ped before conclusions ped has emerged in croatian pig population causing potentially considerable losses the circulating strain was of the s-indel genotype serological workup proved pedv spread to another four agricultural holdings demonstrating the importance of not only external but also internal biosecurity measures
a coronavirus vector based on the genome of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev expressing the rotavirus vp7 protein was constructed to immunize and protect against rotavirus infections in a murine model the tropism of this tgev-derived vector was modified by replacing the spike s protein with the homologous protein from mouse hepatitis virus mhv the rotavirus gene encoding the vp7 protein was cloned into the coronavirus cdna balb/c and stat1-deficient mice were inoculated with the recombinant viral vector rtgev s-mhv -vp7 which replicates in the intestine and spreads to other organs such as liver spleen and lungs tgev-specific antibodies were detected in all the inoculated balb/c mice while rotavirusspecific antibodies were found only after immunization by the intraperitoneal route partial protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea was achieved in suckling balb/c mice born to dams immunized with the recombinant virus expressing vp7 when they were orally challenged with the homotypic rotavirus strain
canine coronavirus ccov is an important pathogen that causes enteritis in dogs but there is no information on ccov infection in vietnam to examine the prevalence of ccov infection among vietnamese dogs 201 serum samples were analyzed by virus-neutralization vn test the results showed that antibody against ccov-ii was present in 87 dogs 43.3%. to detect genes of ccov fecal samples collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs were examinated by rt-pcr confirming that 2 diarrheic dogs and 5 healthy dogs were positive for ccov nucleotide sequences of n-terminal region of spike s gene indicated that ccov strains were divided into two subgenotypes ccov-iia and -iib respectively furthemore we succeeded in isolating ccov/ dog/hcm47/2015 the isolate was plaque-purified three times and 3'-terminal one-third of the genome was analyzed interestingly the plaque-purified virus had a large deletion in orf3abc and e genes 1165 nt and a short deletion in orf7b gene 60 nt suggesting that these regions are not necessary for in vitro replication of ccov next the antigenicity between the isolated ccov-iib and the other ccov-iia was compared by vn test revealing that antigenicty of the isolated ccov is equal or higher than that of the other ccov in summary two subgenotypes of ccov-ii are spreading among vietnamese dogs the isolated virus with a large deletion after in vitro passage may be useful for the development of vaccine owing to its antigenicity and efficient viral growth in vitro
the classic development of vaccines is lengthy tedious and may not necessarily be successful as demonstrated by the case of hiv this is especially a problem for emerging pathogens that are newly introduced into the human population and carry the inherent risk of pandemic spread in a naïve population for such situations a considerable number of different platform technologies are under development these are also under development for pathogens where directly derived vaccines are regarded as too complicated or even dangerous due to the induction of inefficient or unwanted immune responses causing considerable side-effects as for dengue virus among platform technologies are plasmid-based dna vaccines rna replicons single-round infectious vector particles or replicating vaccine-based vectors encoding a critical antigens of the target pathogens among the latter recombinant measles viruses derived from vaccine strains have been tested measles vaccines are among the most effective and safest life-attenuated vaccines known therefore the development of schwarz- moraten- or aik-c-strain derived recombinant vaccines against a wide range of mostly viral but also bacterial pathogens was quite straightforward these vaccines generally induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses in appropriate animal models i e transgenic mice or nonhuman primates also in the recent first clinical phase i trial the results have been quite encouraging the trial indicated the expected safety and efficacy also in human patients interestingly independent from the level of prevalent anti-measles immunity before the trial thereby recombinant measles vaccines expressing additional antigens are a promising platform for future vaccines
background respiratory illness is traditionally regarded as the disease of the growing pig and has historically mainly been associated to bacterial infections with focus on mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae these bacteria still are of great importance but continuously increasing herd sizes have complicated the scenario and the influence of secondary invaders may have been increased the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of a pleuropneumoniae and m hyopneumoniae as well as that of the secondary invaders pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis by serology in four pig herds a-d using age segregated rearing systems with high incidences of pleuritic lesions at slaughter pleuritic lesions registered at slaughter ranged from 20.5 to 33.1 % in the four herds in herd a the levels of serum antibodies to a pleuropneumoniae exceeded a 450 > 1.5 but not to any other microbe searched for the seroconversion took place early during the fattening period similar levels of serum antibodies to a pleuropneumoniae were also recorded in herd b with a subsequent increase in levels of antibodies to p multocida pigs seroconverted to both agents during the early phase of the fattening period in herd c pigs seroconverted to p multocida during the early phase of the fattening period and thereafter to a pleuropneumoniae in herd d the levels of antibodies to p multocida exceeded a 450 > 1.0 in absence a 450 < 0.5 of antibodies to a pleuropneumoniae the levels of serum antibodies to m hyopneumoniae and to s suis remained below a 450 < 1.0 in all four herds pigs seroconverted to m hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period herd b-d or not at all herd a conclusion different serological patterns were found in the four herds with high levels of serum antibodies to a pleuropneumoniae and p multocida either alone or in combination with each other seroconversion to m hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period or not at all confirmed the positive effect of age segregated rearing in preventing or delaying infections with m hyopneumoniae the results obtained highlight the necessity of diagnostic investigations to define the true disease pattern in herds with a high incidence of pleuritic lesions
middle-aged female identical twins one of whom had systemic lupus erythematosus sle were evaluated for immunologic reactivity to previous antigenic challenges including primary immunization with a foreign antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh these two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies both twins demonstrated comparable 7s and 19s humoral antibody response to klh as well as similar viral antibody titers however the twin with sle was anergic to common antigens streptokinase-streptodornase trichophyton and candida furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to klh did not develop after immunization this observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of sle reports of an increased incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus sle other connective tissue diseases and serologic abnormalities in the families of oatients with sle have empha-
licensed live attenuated virus vaccines capable of expressing transgenes from other pathogens have the potential to reduce the number of childhood immunizations by eliciting robust immunity to multiple pathogens simultaneously recombinant attenuated measles virus rmv derived from the edmonston zagreb vaccine strain was engineered to express simian immunodeficiency virus siv gag protein for the purpose of evaluating the immunogenicity of rmv as a vaccine vector in rhesus macaques rmv-gag immunization alone elicited robust measles-specific humoral and cellular responses but failed to elicit transgene gag-specific immune responses following aerosol or intratracheal/intramuscular delivery however when administered as a priming vaccine to a heterologous boost with recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 expressing the same transgene rmv-gag significantly enhanced gag-specific t lymphocyte responses following rad5 immunization gag-specific humoral responses were not enhanced however which may be due to either the transgene or the vector cellular response priming by rmv against the transgene was highly effective even when using a suboptimal dose of rad5 for the boost these data demonstrate feasibility of using rmv as a priming component of heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens for pathogens requiring strong cellular responses
influenza viruses exhibit a fascinating level of antigenic heterogeneity that facilitates re-infection in the human population the human antibody repertoire also manifests endless capability for variation in the genes that specify the portion of antibody molecules interacting with epitopes a recent explosion of techniques for isolating human monoclonal antibodies to viruses has led to isolation of new antibodies that allow glimpses into the molecular basis for recognition and escape that underlies the constant antigenic drift in influenza surface proteins these studies also reveal evidence for lifelong persistence of immunity to some influenza viruses
in the present study we evaluated the protective effect of oral insulin oi on intestinal mucosa following lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal damage in a rat male sprague-dawley rats were divided into three experimental groups sham rats lps-rats that were treated with lipopolysaccharide lps and lps-ins rats that were treated with oi given in drinking water 72 h before and following injection of lps intestinal structural changes enterocyte proliferation enterocyte apoptosis and mucosal expression of toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 were determined 24 h after the last lps injection lps-ins animals showed a significantly greater bowel and mucosal weight in jejunum and ileum mucosal dna and protein in jejunum and ileum villus height in ileum crypt depth in jejunum and ileum cell proliferation rates in jejunum and significantly lower apoptotic index in ileum compared to lpsanimals lps rats demonstrated 50% increase in tlr4 expression in jejunum compared to sham animals treatment with oi resulted in a three-fold increase in tlr4 expression in jejunum compared to lps animals in conclusion oi improves intestinal recovery after lps endotoxemia in a rat
zoonoses are a worldwide public health concern accounting for approximately 75% of human infectious diseases in addition zoonoses adversely affect agricultural production and wildlife we review some mathematical models developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and identify areas where further modeling efforts are needed
ebolavirus and marburgvirus are members of the filovirus family and induce a fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates with 90% case fatality to develop a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus disease common marmosets callithrix jacchus were intramuscularly inoculated with wild type marburgvirus musoke or ebolavirus zaire the infection resulted in a systemic fatal disease with clinical and morphological features closely resembling human infection animals experienced weight loss fever high virus titers in tissue thrombocytopenia neutrophilia high liver transaminases and phosphatases and disseminated intravascular coagulation evidence of a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by multifocal to coalescing hepatic necrosis was seen in ebov animals marv-infected animals displayed only moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytic depletion observed in spleen these findings provide support for the use of the common marmoset as a small nonhuman primate model for filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever
adenoviral vectors are widely employed against infectious diseases or cancers as they can elicit specific antibody responses and t cell responses when they are armed with foreign genes as vaccine carriers and induce apoptosis of the cancer cells when they are genetically modified for cancer therapy in this review we summarize the biological characteristics of adenovirus ad and the latest development of ad vectorbased strategies for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases or cancers strategies to circumvent the pre-existing neutralizing antibodies which dampen the immunogenicity of ad-based vaccines are also discussed
late onset demyelinating encephalomyelitis in mice infected with mhv-jhm in the presence of maternal antibody . microbial pathogenesis 1987 2 185-194 .the presence of maternal antibodies protected suckling c57bl/6 mice from the clinical manifestations of the acute encephalomyelitis caused by mouse hepatitis virus strain jhm mhv-jhm a coronavirus even though histological evidence of encephalomyelitis was found at early times after inoculation . 100% of infected suckling mice developed a fatal disease in the absence of maternal antibody . by 14 days after inoculation the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination . at 3-8 weeks post-inoculation approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting . evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem . the mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation whether symptomatic or not and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis . mhv-jhm could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis . these results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute fatal clinical encephalomyelitis caused by mhv-jhm but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced clinically evident demyelinating disease . this model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of mhv-jhm latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination .
the compatibility safety and interaction on antibody induction of a combined vaccine application were assessed specific pathogenfree cats were vaccinated with either a modified live virus vaccine containing feline calici-fcv herpes-fhv-1 parvovirus fpv and chlamydophila felis c felis an adjuvanted recombinant feline leukaemia virus felv vaccine or both vaccines in one syringe after combined application felv elisa antibody titres were unaltered however antibody production based on indirect immunofluorescence assay was remarkably enhanced for fcv and was at selected time points also enhanced for fhv-1 and c felis but diminished for fpv the use of these vaccines in combination was safe and will simplify vaccination schedules in veterinary practice
several small animal models have been developed for the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov replication and pathogenesis syrian golden hamsters are among the best small animal models though little clinical illness and no mortality are observed after virus infection cyclophosphamide was used to immunosuppress hamsters leading to a prolonged disease course and higher mortality after sars-cov infection in addition there was a significant weight loss expanded tissue tropism and increased viral pathology in the lung heart kidney and nasal turbinate tissues infection with recombinant sars-cov viruses bearing disruptions in the gene 7 coding region showed no significant change in replication kinetics tissue tropism morbidity or mortality suggesting that the orf7a 7a and orf7b 7b proteins are not required for virus replication in immunosuppressed hamsters this modified hamster model may provide a useful tool for sars-cov pathogenesis studies evaluation of antiviral therapy and analysis of additional sars-cov mutants
the immunogenicity of a candidate-inactivated vaccine prepared from sars-cov f69 strain was evaluated in balb/c mice potent humoral immune responses were induced under the elicitation of three times of immunizations at 2-week intervals with this vaccine combined with three types of adjuvants freund's adjuvant aloh 3 adjuvant and cpg adjuvant titers of specific igg antibodies in three test groups all peaked in the sixth week after first vaccination but significant differences existed in the kinetics of specific igg antibody levels the strong neutralizing capacity exhibited in micro-cytopathic effect neutralization tests indicated the specific antibodies are protective western blot assay further demonstrated the specificity of the induced serum antibodies
forty faecal samples were tested by rt-pcr using coronavirus consensus primers to determine faecal shedding of canine coronavirus ccov and canine respiratory coronavirus crcov in a dog population housed at a rescue centre seven samples were positive for ccov while all samples were negative for crcov sequence analysis of five ccov strains showed a high similarity with transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev at the nterminus of the spike protein all strains contained an open reading frame for the nonstructural protein 7b which is not present in tgev indicating that the strains were related to the previously described ccov strain ucd-1 two samples contained ccov strains with 5 spike sequences most similar to type ii ccov while one sample was found to contain type i ccov primers directed to the n gene allowed specific detection of all ccov strains analysed in this study this investigation shows that ccov strains containing spike proteins similar to tgev are present in the uk dog population pcr primers directed to conserved regions of the ccov genome are recommended for detection of ccov in clinical samples due to high genetic variability
exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including lujo virus in southern africa severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus in china and a sars-like coronavirus in the middle east the sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them due to this animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines for these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans in this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral pathogens
hendra virus hev infection in humans is characterized by an influenza like illness which may progress to pneumonia or encephalitis and lead to death the pathogenesis of hev infection is poorly understood and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research in this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for hev infection and found that mice are susceptible to hev infection after intranasal exposure with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease we propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain possibly along olfactory nerves this is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals in our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models these studies report a new animal model of hev encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of hev infection particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease and inform the development of improved treatment options for human patients
sepsis is one of the oldest and most elusive syndromes in medicine with the confi rmation of germ theory by semmelweis pasteur and others sepsis was considered as a systemic infection by a pathogenic organism although the germ is probably the beginning of the syndrome and one of the major enemies to be identifi ed and fought sepsis is something wider and more elusive in this chapter clinically relevant themes of sepsis will be approached to provide an insight of everyday clinical practice for healthcare workers often not directly involved in the patient's management
one of the most dangerous human pathogens with high prevalence worldwide is streptococcus pyogenes which has major impacts on global morbidity and mortality a major challenge for s pyogenes vaccine development is the detection of epitopes that confer protection from infection by multiple s pyogenes types our aim was to identify the most conserved and immunogenic antigens of s pyogenes which can be a potential candidate for vaccine design in the future eight important surface proteins were analyzed using different prediction servers strongest epitopes were selected they had the ability to stimulate the humoral and cell-mediated immune system molecular docking was performed for measuring free-binding energy of selected epitopes seven epitopes from three surface proteins were selected as potential candidates for vaccine development conservation of selected epitopes among different streptococcus types was checked further in vitro and in vivo tests are required to validate the suitability of the epitopes for vaccine design
to have epidemic potential a pathogen must be able to spread in human populations but of human-infective rna viruses only a minority can do so we investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 rna virus genera we identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds a public health threat recently designated "disease x". humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans this result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of rna virus diversity in non-human hosts author/funder all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission
we describe a physics-based learning model for predicting the immunogenicity of cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitopes derived from diverse pathogens given a human leukocyte antigen hla genotype the model was trained and tested on experimental data on the relative immunodominance of ctl epitopes in human immunodeficiency virus infection the method is more accurate than publicly available models our model predicts that only a fraction of sars-cov-2 epitopes that have been predicted to bind to hla molecules is immunogenic the immunogenic ctl epitopes across all sars-cov-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage but the immunogenic epitopes in the sars-cov-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so our model predicts that several immunogenic sars-cov-2 ctl epitopes are identical to those contained in low-pathogenicity coronaviruses circulating in the population thus we suggest that some level of ctl immunity against covid-19 may be present in some individuals prior to sars-cov-2 infection
post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws is a recently identified disease of pigs linked to the emergence of a new porcine circovirus pcv2 we report here the characterization of immunorelevant linear b-cell epitopes of the open reading frame 2-encoded protein orf2 from pcv2 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using experimental antisera collected from pigs inoculated with a pcv2 isolate two epitopes spanning residues 69 to 83 and 117 to 131 were specific to pcv2 antibodies to the 117 to 131 epitope b-133 were detected in 22% and 100% of specific pathogen-free spf pig sera 6 and 11 weeks post inoculation respectively cross-sectional studies performed with field sera collected from pmws-affected herds showed b-133 antibodies in 5% of 8 to 10 week-old pigs 38% of 13-14 week-old pigs 62% of 16 to 19 week-old pigs 56% of 20 to 25 week-old pigs and 45% of 26 to 31 week-old pigs all these data suggest that epitope b-133 is a serological marker of pcv2 infection that could be used for the detection of pcv2 antibody response
v accines against viral diseasehave trad itionally relied on attenuated virus strains or inactivation of infectious virus subunit vaccinesbased on viral proteins expressedin heterologous systemshave been effectivefor some pathogens but have ofien suffered from poor immunogenicity due to incorrect protein folding or modification in this chapter we focus on a specific classofviral subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure ofvirus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation ofthe immunogenic proteins thesevirus-likeparticles vlps have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses and have unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches with new vlp vaccines for papillomavirus beginning to reach the market placewe argue that this technology has now 'come-of-age' and must be considered a viable vaccine strategy
pigs are believed to be one of the important sources of emerging human and swine influenza viruses swiv influenza virus conserved peptides have the potential to elicit crossprotective immune response but without the help of potent adjuvant and delivery system they are poorly immunogenic biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid plga nanoparticle plga-np based vaccine delivery system enhances cross-presentation of antigens by the professional antigen presenting cells in this study norovirus p particle containing swiv m2e extracellular domain of the matrix protein 2 chimera and highly conserved two each of h1n1 peptides of pandemic 2009 and classical human influenza viruses were entrapped in plga-nps influenza antibody-free pigs were vaccinated with plga-nps peptides cocktail vaccine twice with or without an adjuvant mycobacterium vaccae whole cell lysate intranasally as mist vaccinated pigs were challenged with a virulent heterologous zoonotic swiv h1n1 and one week later euthanized and the lung samples were analyzed for the specific immune response and viral load clinically pigs vaccinated with plga-np peptides vaccine had no fever and flu symptoms and the replicating challenged swiv was undetectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid immunologically plga-np peptides vaccination without adjuvant significantly increased the frequency of antigen-specific ifnγ secreting cd4 and cd8 t cells response in the lung lymphocytes despite not boosting the antibody response both at pre-and post-challenge in summary our data indicated that nanoparticlemediated delivery of conserved h1n1 influenza peptides induced the virus specific t cell response in the lungs and reduced the challenged heterologous virus load in the airways of pigs
the continuous increase of mers cases has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide calling for development of safe and effective mers vaccines we have previously shown that a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov receptor-binding domain rbd fused with human fc s377-588-fc induced highly potent anti-mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in the presence of mf59 adjuvant here we optimized the doses of s377-588-fc using mf59 as an adjuvant in order to elicit strong immune responses with minimal amount of antigen our results showed that s377-588-fc at 1 mg was able to induce in the immunized mice potent humoral and cellular immune responses particularly s377-588-fc at 1 mg elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against both pseudotyped and live mers-cov similar to those induced at 5 and 20 mg respectively these results suggest that this rbd-based subunit mers vaccine candidate at the dose as low as one mg is sufficiently potent to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses including neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection thus providing guidance for determining the optimal dosage of rbd-based mers vaccines in the future clinical trials and for applying the dosesparing strategy in other subunit vaccine trials www tandfonline com

pneumonia virus of mice pvm infection of balb/c mice induces bronchiolitis leading to a fatal pneumonia in a dose-dependent manner closely paralleling the development of severe disease during human respiratory syncytial virus infection in man and is thus a recognised model in which to study the pathogenesis of pneumoviruses this model system was used to investigate delivery of the internal structural proteins of pvm as a potential vaccination strategy to protect against pneumovirus disease replicationdeficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 rad5 vectors were constructed that expressed the m or n gene of pvm pathogenic strain j3666 intranasal delivery of these rad5 vectors gave protection against a lethal challenge dose of pvm in three different mouse strains and protection lasted for at least 20 weeks post-immunisation whilst the pvm-specific antibody response in such animals was weak and inconsistent rad5n primed a strong pvm-specific cd8 + t cell response and to a lesser extent a cd4 + t cell response these findings suggest that t-cell responses may be more important than serum igg in the observed protection induced by rad5n
dengue virus denv is transmitted by infectious mosquitoes during blood-feeding via saliva containing biologically-active proteins here we examined the effect of varying denv infection modality in rhesus macaques in order to improve the denv nonhuman primate nhp challenge model nhps were exposed to denv-1 via subcutaneous or intradermal inoculation of virus only intradermal inoculation of virus and salivary gland extract or infectious mosquito feeding the infectious mosquito feeding group exhibited delayed onset of viremia greater viral loads and altered clinical and immune responses compared to other groups after 15 months nhps in the subcutaneous and infectious mosquito feeding groups were re-exposed to either denv-1 or denv-2 viral replication and neutralizing antibody following homologous challenge were suggestive of sterilizing immunity whereas heterologous challenge resulted in productive yet reduced denv-2 replication and boosted neutralizing antibody these results show that a more transmission-relevant exposure modality resulted in viral replication closer to that observed in humans
to determine whether a protective immune response could be elicited by oral delivery of a recombinant live bacterial vaccine helicobacter pylori urease subunit b ureb was expressed for extracellular expression in food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis the ureb-producing strains were then administered orally to mice and the immune response to ureb was examined orally vaccinated mice produced a significant ureb-specific serum immunoglobulin g igg response specific anti-ureb iga responses could be detected in the feces of mice immunized with the secreting lactococcal strain mice vaccinated orally were significantly protected against gastric helicobacter infection following a challenge with h pylori strain ss1 in conclusion mucosal vaccination with l lactis expressing ureb produced serum igg and ureb-specific fecal iga and prevented gastric infection with h pylori

from 1992 onwards outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in asian seabass lates calcarifer kept in maricultures in southeast asia the most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales it was referred to as scale drop syndrome but the etiology remained enigmatic by using a next-generation virus discovery technique vidisca-454 sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish the near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined which shows a unique genome organization and low levels of identity to known members of the iridoviridae based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins the virus is a novel member of the megalocytivirus genus of the iridoviridae family the virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected asian seabass kidney and brain cells electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm characteristic for the iridoviridae in vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish these findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome as each of koch's postulates is fulfilled we have named the virus scale drop disease virus vaccines prepared from bei-and formalin inactivated virus as well as from e coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease asian seabass or lates calcarifer is a large valuable fish kept in maricultures scale drop syndrome is an emerging disease in this species that currently results in significant economic losses for affected farms mortality rates can become as high as 50% both in plos pathogens |
porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev is the causative agent of acute diarrhea of newborn piglets that provokes high mortality rates in affected farms in this study specific immunoglobulin from egg yolk against tgev was produced by immunization of white leghorn hens enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and virus neutralization vn test revealed that the specific antibody titer started to increase on the tenth day post-immunization reached its peak on the eighth week and remained at a high level until the last week that we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of egg yolk immunoglobulin igy was investigated in piglets igy was found effective to increase piglets survival rate significantly after challenge exposures in prophylactic efficacy analysis the therapeutic effects test revealed that the mortality was dramatically reduced by orally administered igy all these results in our study indicated that igy specific to tgev could be an alternative prophylactic method like colostral antibodies against tgev in piglets
the notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen can damage the central nervous system cns and lead to neurological disease was tested using a human respiratory coronavirus the oc43 strain of human coronavirus hcov-oc43 first primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection neurons were the target cells undergoing degeneration during infection in part due to apoptosis second neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice intracerebral inoculation of hcov-oc43 into balb/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals whereas viral rna persisted for several months some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection these results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals
nmri mice were vaccinated by the aerosol technique using the ethylethylenimine inactivated and polyethylenglycol concentrated virus strain a/pr/8/34 ho /nl with or without addition of bordetella pertussis extract bpe as an adjuvant the immune response of the vaccinated animals was controlled by challenge infection via aerosol technique and by examination of hal antibodies in the serum and in the washings of lungs after a single aerosol vaccination a weak protection was observed only if the vaccines contained bpe but a second immunization with a vaccine containing bpe induced a high degree of immunity even if a reduced amount of antigen was used for booster vaccination after three aerosol vaccine doses in two-weeks intervals however we were unable to infect the immunized animals even with largest amounts of challenge virus approximately 50000 ld5o the addition of bpe as an adjuvant induced a significantly better protection and resulted in much higher titres of hal antibodies in the serum and in the respiratory tract compared to mice vaccinated by the same procedure but without bpe
we have investigated novel vaccine strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov using cdna constructs encoding the structural antigens s m e or n protein derived from sars cov pbl from healthy human volunteers were administered i p into il-2 receptor ␥-chain disrupted scid mice and scid-pbl/hu mice were constructed these mice can be used to analyze the human immune response in vivo sars m dna vaccine and n dna vaccine induced human ctl specific for sars cov antigens alternatively sars m dna vaccines inducing human neutralizing antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies against sars cov are now being developed these results show that these vaccines can induce virus-specific immune responses and should provide a useful tool for development of protective and therapeutic vaccines
the mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood a prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 virus isolate a/vietnam/1203/ 2004 or reassortants of human influenza virus a/texas/36/ 91 h1n1 containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza a h1n1 virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection however virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the h5n1 group and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1a hif-1a
human coronaviruses are known to be a common cause of respiratory infections in man however the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections two proteins were examined the human coronavirus 229e nucleocapsid protein n expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pur and the coronavirus 229e surface glycoprotein s expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pros the recombinant proteins were used as antigens in western blot wb assays to detect the 229e-specific igg antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method indirect immunofluorescence serum samples of 51 paediatric patients suffering from acute respiratory illness and 10 adults voluntarily infected with human coronavirus were tested the semm samples of the adult group had coronavims-specific igg antibodies in both test systems in contrast only 8/51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific igg by both wb and if and 20/51 sera were positive by wb but not by if the overall incidence of human coronavims infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by wb analysis and 16% evaluated by if this study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229e proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229e infections 0166-0934/95/$09.50 0 1995 elsevier science b v all rights reserved ssdio166-09349500041-o
salmonella s typhi is an important intracellular pathogen among the more than 2300 closely-related salmonella serovars bacteria recognized s typhi is the only one that is pathogenic exclusively for humans in whom it causes typhoid or enteric fever the pathogen has been around for many years and many studies have been done in an effort to combat it molecular and biologic features of s typhi and host factors and immune responses involved in salmonella invasion have been extensively studies vaccines that have been developed most notably are vi polysaccharide and ty21a however as the results show there is still a long way to go it is also shown that multi-drug resistance has occurred to the few available antibiotics more and more studies have shown that salmonella can be used as a vaccine vector carrying antigens of other pathogens this has been promising in that the immune system can be elicited in response to both the salmonella bacteria and the antigen of the pathogen in question this review aims to highlight some of the milestones attained in the fight against the disease from the time s typhi was seen as a pathogen causing typhoid fever to the use of salmonella as a vaccine vector cellular & molecular immunology 20085291-97
the efficacy of two heating cycles 90 sec at 103 o c and 10 hr at 65 "c used during manufacture of a plasma-derived hepatitis-b vaccine was validated for the inactivation of 12 virus families a period of 15 min warming up to 65 o c had already completely inactivated representatives of nine virus families ie poxvirus vaccinia picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus togavirus sindbis virus coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus orthomyxovirus influenza virus rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus herpes virus cytomegalovirus lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus and retrovirus murine leukemia virus after prolonged heating at 65 o c or heating for 90 sec at 103 "c parvovirus canine parvovirus and the phage phix174 were also completely inactivated papovavirus represented by simian virus 40 sv-40 was the most heat-resistant virus evaluated the infectivity of sv-40 was reduced by lo4 tissue culture infectious doses tcidso per ml after 90 sec at 103 o c but a marginal residual activity t l . 5 tcid per ml was observed subsequent pasteurization for 10 h at 65 "c did not further reduce the infectivity of sv-40 this study shows that the two heat-inactivation steps used during the production of this vaccine kill a wide variety of viruses that might be present in human blood
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases are major threats to global health economic stability and national security vaccines are key for reducing coronaviral disease burden however the utility of live-attenuated vaccines is limited by risks of reversion or repair because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness here we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks trns are effective vaccines against sars-cov the trn-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal sars-cov challenge while a 3-nt rewired trn reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage a 7-nt rewired trn is more stable suggesting that a more extensively rewired trn might be essential for avoiding growth selection in summary rewiring the trn is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the nidovirales order
feline and primate immunodeficiency viruses fivs sivs and hiv are transmitted via direct contact e g fighting sexual contact and mother-offspring transmission this dynamic likely poses a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild recently several host intracellular anti-viral proteins that contribute to species-specificity of primate lentiviruses have been identified revealing adaptive mechanisms that further limit spread of lentiviruses between species consistent with these interspecies transmission barriers phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that fiv transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings recently we documented that puma and bobcats in southern california share an fiv strain providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins these studies are facilitated by the availability of the 2â cat genome sequence annotation in addition concurrent viral and host genetic analyses have been used to track patterns of migration of the host species and barriers to transmission of the virus within the african lion these studies illustrate the utility of fiv as a model to discover the variables necessary for establishment and control of lentiviral infections in new species published by elsevier b v
arboviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that exhibit worldwide distribution and are a constant threat not only for public health but also for wildlife domestic animals and even plants to study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon α/β ifn-α/β receptor ifnar−/− have been described as a model of arbovirus infections studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues and in some cases the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals moreover the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections a tremendous advantage of the ifnar−/− mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans experimental infections of ifnar−/− mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host therefore ifnar−/− mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission pathogenesis virulence and the protective efficacy of new vaccines in this review article the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the ifnar−/− mouse model will be reviewed

porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a coronavirus that infects cells lining the small intestine of swine resulting in vomiting diarrhea and dehydration the amino acid sequence of the spike s protein which is the principal target recognized by host immune cells has multiple mutations that distinguish the two pedv genotypes g1 and g2 to determine whether these mutations lead to changes in antigenicity as suggested by the failure of pedv vaccines in china we first optimized the codons of typical s genes of the cv777 vaccine strain g1 subtype and lnct2 strain g2 subtype and expressed the recombinant full-length sequence of the s protein in a eukaryotic expression system the igg antibody levels of serum from mice immunized with purified s protein were markedly high antigenicity was compared by detection of polyclonal antibodies pabs against the virus and s protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa an indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa and a serum cross-neutralization sn assay reactivity with the pabs revealed significant cross-reactivity between the two pedv subtypes although there was a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on pab titers in the elisa and ifa consistent with the variation in the s gene sequences the sn titer suggested differences in the neutralization activity of the s protein between the two subtypes which could explain the antigenic variation between the pedv subtypes g1 and g2
development of effective vaccines to prevent influenza particularly highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai caused by influenza a virus iav subtype h5n1 is a challenging goal in this study we designed and constructed two recombinant influenza vaccine candidates by fusing hemagglutinin 1 ha1 fragment of a/anhui/1/2005h5n1 to either fc of human igg ha1-fc or foldon plus fc ha1-fdc and evaluated their immune responses and cross-protection against divergent strains of h5n1 virus results showed that these two recombinant vaccines induced strong immune responses in the vaccinated mice which specifically reacted with ha1 proteins and an inactivated heterologous h5n1 virus both proteins were able to cross-neutralize infections by one homologous strain clade 2.3 and four heterologous strains belonging to clades 0 1 and 2.2 of h5n1 pseudoviruses as well as three heterologous strains clades 0 1 and 2.3.4 of h5n1 live virus importantly immunization with these two vaccine candidates especially ha1-fdc provided complete cross-clade protection against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of h5n1 virus covering clade 0 1 and 2.3.4 in the tested mouse model this study suggests that the recombinant fusion proteins particularly ha1-fdc could be developed into an efficacious universal h5n1 influenza vaccine providing cross-protection against infections by divergent strains of highly pathogenic h5n1 virus citation du l leung vh-c zhang x zhou j chen m et al 2011 a recombinant vaccine of h5n1 ha1 fused with foldon and human igg fc induced complete cross-clade protection against divergent h5n1 viruses plos one 61 e16555

the influence of the microbiota on viral infection susceptibility and disease outcome is undisputable although varies among viruses the purpose of understanding the interactions between microbiota virus and host is to identify practical effective and safe approaches that target microbiota for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases in humans and animals as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available the initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences focusing on the viral pathogens-from human and animal studies-that have already been shown to interact with microbiota the subsequent step is to identify mechanisms through experimental evidences to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota in this chapter we review evidences of virus infections altering microbiota and of microbiota enhancing or suppressing infectivity altering host susceptibility to certain viral diseases and influencing vaccine immunogenicity in humans and farm animals proteobacteria bifidobacterium aly et al 22 ruminococcus bajaj et al 23 article in press avian influenza virus chicken proteobacteria yitbarek et al 24 enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli clostridium veillonella li et al 25
as concerns increase about adenovirus type 5 ad5 being a safe gene transfer vector it is important to evaluate its distribution residence time and possible toxicity in immunodeficient populations to characterize the potential risk associated with different ad5 vector delivery modes we used immunocompetent and immunodeficient rag2 −/− animals to establish mouse and rat models that could be monitored with bioluminescent imaging following intramuscular or intravascular infection with an engineered replication-incompetent ad5 virus carrying the firefly luciferase gene ad5-fluc the ad5 vector was less well-tolerated by rag2 −/− animals than by wildtype ones with delayed residence time wider virus dissemination less weight gain and relatively severe pathological changes in intravascularly ad5-fluc-infected rag2 −/− mice systemic virus dissemination extended from the abdomen to the limbs and head on day 9 post-infection additionally significant increases in plasma tnf-α and ifn-γ which may be important factors in the heightened immunopathology in the liver and brain were detected in the rag2 −/− mice 30 days after intravascular delivery the ad5 vector was better tolerated after intramuscular delivery than after intravascular delivery ad5-fluc/rag2 −/− mice and rats can be used as reliable models of an immunodeficient population in which to evaluate the safety of ad5vectored vaccines or gene therapy products adenovirus type 5 ad5 is widely used experimentally and clinically for gene delivery in oncology cardioangiology and regenerative medicine and is also used as a vaccine vector 1-3 . replicating and non-replicating adenoviruses have been shown to be safe vectors in numerous clinical studies 4 . however serious concerns regarding the safety of the ad5 vector arose when a clinical trial was halted in response to its fatal adverse effects on an ornithine-transcarbamylase-deficient patient in 1999 5 . therefore a comprehensive understanding of the virological and biological features that define the infectivity and possible toxicity of ad5 in different individuals is urgently required immunosuppression occurs in various types of patients including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv the recipients of organ transplantation and those with hypogammaglobulinaemia 6 7 . all of these patients are generally characterized by an increased and distinctive susceptibility to various types of pathogens depending on the nature of the immune defect 8 . however the behaviour including biodistribution and residence time of the ad5 vector adv5 in the context of immunodeficiency is poorly understood we previously constructed a replication-competent vaccinia tiantan strain infection model using an in vivo bioluminescent imaging bli method and found that immunodeficient rats were more susceptible to vaccinia virus than sprague dawley sd rats and also displayed prolonged infections 9 . the bli technology has the advantages of rapidity simplicity and quantitative precision which allows the dissemination and clearance of viral vectors in intact and living animals to be carefully evaluated 10 . the aim of this study was to characterize the risk published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/

examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of different virus families several mechanisms many of which still are poorly understood are at the basis of this phenomenon vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general and for hiv/aids in particular has been little successful certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them for vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus dengue virus and feline immunodeficiency virus it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement ade plays an important role other mechanisms may either in the absence of or in combination with ade be involved consequently vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi- corona- paramyxo- and lentivirus vaccines also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against hiv may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection there may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other the present paper reviews the currently known mechanisms of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis

immune responses to the infectious bronchitis virus ibv nucleocapsid protein were studied using a recombinant-dna expression product in mice a lymphocyte proltferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to ibv were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein next we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to ibv in chickens chickens were primed with nucleocapsidprotein and subsequently boosted with inactivated ibv strain m41 proltferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres finally an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live ibv was observed these results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsidprotein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken
bats play a significant role in maintaining their ecosystems through pollination dispersal of seeds and control of insect populations but they are also known to host many microorganisms and have been described as natural reservoirs for viruses with zoonotic potential the diversity of viruses in these animals remains largely unknown however because studies are limited by species location virus target or sample type therefore the aim of this study was to detect fragments of viral genomes in bat samples we performed high-throughput sequencing analysis and specific pcr and rt-pcr on pools of anal and oropharyngeal swabs from artibeus lituratus and sturnira lilium collected in southern brazil as a result a member of the family adenoviridae related to human adenovirus c was detected in anal swabs from s lilium in addition we detected a papillomavirus in an anal swab from a lituratus our analyses also allowed the detection of adenoviruses and parvoviruses in oropharyngeal swabs collected from a lituratus these results increase our knowledge about viral diversity and illustrate the importance of conducting virus surveillance in bats
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is the causative agent of one of the most devastating and economically significant viral disease of pigs worldwide the vaccines currently available on the market elicit only limited protection recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv replicon particles vrp have been used successfully to induce protection against influenza a virus iav in chickens and bluetongue virus in sheep in this study vsv vrp expressing the prrsv envelope proteins gp5 m gp4 gp3 gp2 and the nucleocapsid protein n individually or in combination were generated and evaluated as a potential vector vaccine against prrsv infection high level expression of the recombinant prrsv proteins was demonstrated in cell culture however none of the prrsv antigens expressed from vrp with the exception of the n protein did induce any detectable antibody response in pigs before challenge infection with prrsv after challenge however the antibody responses against gp5 gp4 and gp3 appeared in average 2 weeks earlier than in pigs vaccinated with the empty control vrp no reduction of viremia was observed in the vaccinated group compared with the control group when pigs were co-vaccinated with vrp expressing iav antigens and vrp expressing prrsv glycoproteins only antibody responses to the iav antigens were detectable these data show that the vsv replicon vector can induce immune responses to heterologous proteins in pigs but that the prrsv envelope proteins expressed from vsv vrp are poorly immunogenic nevertheless they prime the immune system for significantly earlier b-cell responses following prrsv challenge infection
live vaccines are widely used in the avian industry such vaccines can be either injected or delivered on animal mucosa and are usually not adjuvanted in this study we show that live vaccines efficacy can be improved by formulation with adjuvants in a model of mucosal delivery of live infectious bronchitis vaccine in chicken three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted live vaccines improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference moreover spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference our data demonstrates that the use of montanide tm adjuvants in the formulation of live poultry vaccines for mucosal delivery can confer to vaccinated animals a significantly improved protection against pathogens
infectious diarrhea remains one the biggest health challenges in both the beef and dairy industries more than 20% of beef cattle owners feel that calf diarrhea has a significant impact on their economic productivity 1 and diarrhea accounts for more than half of all calf mortality on dairy farms 2 currently enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec cryptosporidium parvum rotavirus and coronavirus appear to be the most significant infectious causes of calf diarrhea research into the pathophysiology of these organisms may ultimately lead to more specific treatment and control recommendations epidemiologic studies of both beef and dairy calves have implicated etec as the major cause of neonatal diarrhea occurring in the first 4 days of life however it rarely leads to diarrhea in older calves or adult cattle 3-6 immediately after birth oral exposure to fecal coliforms leads to colonization of the gut with the normal commensal flora and these organisms continue to move caudally through the gastrointestinal tract with ingesta 78 if environmental contamination is high etec organisms are ingested at this same time and are able to produce disease caused by the presence of two virulence factors k99 fimbria and heat stable toxin because nonpathogenic e coli are extremely common fecal cultures as a diagnostic test are of little value unless the presence of these two virulence factors can be demonstrated attachment to the intestinal epithelium allows the bacteria to maintain residence in the small intestine and multiply instead of being passed though with the ingesta studies have shown that up to 80% of the organisms are attached in calves with etec diarrhea instead of only 10% to 20% in normal calves 3 9 10 this attachment is mediated by the presence of fimbrial antigens the antigen most commonly associated with
covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 infection has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world plenty of diagnostic preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since december 2019 however animal models particularly non-human primate models are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines in this study two families of non-human primates old world monkeys 12 macaca mulatta 6 macaca fascicularis and new world monkeys 6 callithrix jacchus were experimentally inoculated with sars-cov-2 clinical signs were recorded samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding viremia and histopathological examination increased body temperature was observed in 100% 12/12 m mulatta 33.3% 2/6 m fascicularis and none 0/6 of c jacchus post inoculation of sars-cov-2 all of m mulatta and m fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs throat swabs anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation from necropsied m mulatta and m fascicularis tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung weasand bronchus and spleen no viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied c jacchus severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung heart and stomach of sars-cov-2 infected animals in summary we have established a nhp model for covid-19 which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines and investigate viral pathogenesis m mulatta is the most susceptible to sars-cov2 infection followed by m fascicularis and c jacchus m mulatta is the most susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection as compared to m fascicularis and c jacchus

porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a highly contagious enteric pathogen of swine causing high mortality rates in piglets pedv outbreaks have occurred continuously in most swine-producing asian countries and have recently emerged in the united states leading to large economic losses for both the asian and us pig industries the spike s protein of pedv consists of the s1 and s2 domains responsible for virus binding and fusion respectively the involvement of the s1 domain in specific highaffinity interactions with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host makes it a logical target for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against pedv passive immunization by oral administration of egg yolk antibodies igy obtained from immunized chickens provides an alternative source of specific antibodies for the prevention and treatment of pedv in newborn piglets in this study we produced an igy against the pedv s1 protein and investigated its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal piglets a codonoptimized pedv s1 gene consisting of amino acid residues 25-749 was synthesized and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing a recombinant pedv s1 protein containing the chicken immunoglobulin fc fragment at its c-terminus the purified recombinant s1 protein was found to mediate potent immune responses in immunized hens we next tested the ability of oral passive immunization with anti-pedv s1 igy to protect piglets against pedv specific chicken igy against the s1 protein was orally administered to neonatal piglets and their responses subsequent to a virulent pedv challenge were monitored the results showed that oral administration of anti-pedv s1 igy efficiently protects neonatal piglets against pedv suggesting its potential as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against acute pedv infection.& changhee lee
to develop early diagnostic reagents effective vaccines and even drugs against sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov the human single fold single-chain antibody fragments scfv libraries i + j tomlinson i + j were used to identify novel scfvs which can specifically bind to sars-cov interestingly two scfvs b5 and b9 exhibited higher binding specificity to sars-cov with the od 450 value 0.608 and 0.545 respectively and their coding sequences shared the identical sequence composed of v h gene 351 bp and v l gene 327 bp so the two scfvs were uniformly named as sa59b and chosen for further analysis sa59b scfv was expressed in soluble form in escherichia coli hb2151 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography the soluble 30 kda sa59b scfv-antibody was verified in sds-page and western-blot the purified sa59b scfv-antibody was labeled with hrp by the glutaraldehyde method and the concentration of hrp and sa59b scfv-antibody in the sa59b-hrp solution reached 2.4 and 2.28 mg/ml respectively then the binding ability of sa59b-hrp to sars-cov was evaluated by elisa with s/n of 11.6 indicating higher binding specificity between them finally both the sa59b sequence specificity and its application for diagnosis prophylaxis or therapy of sars were discussed
the induction of a strong mucosal immune response is essential to building successful hiv vaccines highly attenuated recombinant hiv vaccinia virus can be administered mucosally but even high doses of immunization have been found unable to induce strong mucosal antibody responses in order to solve this problem we studied the interactions of recombinant hiv vaccinia virus tiantan strain rvtt-gagpol in mucosal epithelial cells specifically caco-2 cell layers and in balb/c mice we evaluated the impact of this virus on hiv antigen delivery and specific immune responses the results demonstrated that rvtt-gagpol was able to infect caco-2 cell layers and both the nasal and lung epithelia in balb/c mice the progeny viruses and expressed p24 were released mainly from apical surfaces in balb/c mice the infection was limited to the respiratory system and was not observed in the blood this showed that polarized distribution limited antigen delivery into the whole body and thus limited immune response to see if this could be improved upon we stimulated unpolarized budding of the virus and hiv antigens by treating both caco-2 cells and balb/c mice with colchicine we found that in balb/c mice the degree of infection and antigen expression in the epithelia went up as a result specific immune responses increased correspondingly together these data suggest that polarized budding limits antigen delivery and immune responses but unpolarized distribution can increase antigen expression and delivery and thus enhance specific immune responses this conclusion can be used to optimize mucosal hiv vaccine strategies
nipah virus niv was first recognized in 1998 in a zoonotic disease outbreak associated with highly lethal febrile encephalitis in humans and a predominantly respiratory disease in pigs periodic deadly outbreaks documentation of person-to-person transmission and the potential of this virus as an agent of agroterror reinforce the need for effective means of therapy and prevention in this report we describe the vaccine potential of niv virus-like particles niv vlps composed of three niv proteins g f and m co-expression of these proteins under optimized conditions resulted in quantifiable amounts of vlps with many virus-like/vaccine desirable properties including some not previously described for vlps of any paramyxovirus the particles were fusogenic inducing syncytia formation pcr array analysis showed niv vlpinduced activation of innate immune defense pathways the surface structure of niv vlps imaged by cryoelectron microscopy was dense ordered and repetitive and consistent with similarly derived structure of paramyxovirus measles virus the vlps were composed of all the three viral proteins as designed and their intracellular processing also appeared similar to niv virions the size morphology and surface composition of the vlps were consistent with the parental virus and importantly they retained their antigenic potential finally these particles formulated without adjuvant were able to induce neutralizing antibody response in balb/c mice these findings indicate vaccine potential of these particles and will be the basis for undertaking future protective efficacy studies in animal models of niv disease
astroviruses are a diverse family of viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts here we describe the phylogenetic diversity and current classification methodology of astroviruses based on the orf1b and orf2 genes highlighting the propensity of astroviruses to undergo interspecies transmission and genetic recombination which greatly increase diversity and complicate attempts at a unified and comprehensive classification strategy

this review examines parasite zoonoses and wildlife in the context of the one health triad that encompasses humans domestic animals wildlife and the changing ecosystems in which they live human anthropogenic activities influence the flow of all parasite infections within the one health triad and the nature and impact of resulting spillover events are examined examples of spillover from wildlife to humans and/or domestic animals and vice versa are discussed as well as emerging issues particularly the need for parasite surveillance of wildlife populations emphasis is given to trypanosoma cruzi and related species in australian wildlife
noroviruses are rna viruses that belong to the genus norovirus family caliciviridae and infect human beings and several animal species including cattle bovine norovirus infections have been detected in cattle of a range of different ages throughout the world currently there is no suitable cell culture system for these viruses and information on their pathogenesis is limited molecular and serological tests have been developed but are complicated by the high genetic and antigenic diversity of bovine noroviruses bovine noroviruses can be detected frequently in faecal samples of diarrhoeic calves either alone or in association with other common enteric pathogens suggesting a role for these viruses in the aetiology of calf enteritis
currently available diagnostic assays for leptospirosis cannot differentiate vaccine from infection serum antibody several leptospiral proteins that are upregulated during infection have been described but their utility as a diagnostic marker is still unclear in this study we undertook a lipidomics approach to determine if there are any differences in the serum lipid profiles of horses naturally infected with pathogenic leptospira spp and horses vaccinated against a commercially available bacterin utilizing a high-resolution mass spectrometry serum lipidomics analytical platform we demonstrate that cyclic phosphatidic acids diacylglycerols and hydroperoxide oxidation products of choline plasmalogens are elevated in the serum of naturally infected as well as vaccinated horses other lipids of interest were triacylglycerols that were only elevated in the serum of infected horses and sphingomyelins that were increased only in the serum of vaccinated horses this is the first report looking at the equine serum lipidome during leptospiral infection and vaccination
the aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses circulating amongst elite racehorses in a training yard by serological testing of serial samples and to determine their impact on health status and ability to race a six-month longitudinal study was conducted in 30 thoroughbred racehorses 21 two-year-olds five three-year-olds and four four-year-olds during the flat racing season sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 ehv-1 and ehv-4 and equine rhinitis viruses a and b erav and erbv by complement fixation cf and equine arteritis virus eav by elisa antibodies against equine influenza ei were measured by haemagglutination inhibition hi only erav was circulating in the yard throughout the six-month study period seroconversion to erav frequently correlated with clinical respiratory disease and was significantly associated with subsequent failure to race p = 0.0009 over 55% of the two-year-olds in the study seroconverted to erav in may and june in contrast only one seroconversion to erav was observed in the older horses they remained free of any signs of respiratory disease and raced successfully throughout the study period the importance of erav as a contributory factor in the interruption of training programmes for young horses may be underestimated
human adenoviruses hadvs are highly contagious and result in large number of acute respiratory disease ard cases with severe morbidity and mortality human adenovirus type 3 hadv-3 is the most common type that causes ard outbreaks in asia europe and the americas however there is currently no vaccine approved for its general use the hexon protein contains the main neutralizing epitopes provoking strong and lasting immunogenicity in this study a novel recombinant and attenuated adenovirus vaccine candidate against hadv-3 was constructed based on a commercially-available replication-defective hadv-5 gene therapy and vaccine vector the entire hadv-3 hexon gene was integrated into the e1 region of the vector by homologous recombination using a bacterial system the resultant recombinants expressing the hadv-3 hexon protein were rescued in ad293 cells identified and characterized by rt-pcr western blots indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy this potential vaccine candidate had a similar replicative efficacy as the wild-type hadv-3 strain however and importantly the vaccine strain had been rendered replication-defective and was incapable of replication in a549 cells after more than twentygeneration passages in ad293 cells this represents a significant safety feature the mice immunized both intranasally and intramuscularly by this vaccine candidate raised significant neutralizing antibodies against hadv-3 therefore this recombinant attenuated and safe adenovirus vaccine is a promising hadv-3 vaccine candidate the strategy of using a clinically approved and replication-defective hadv-5 vector provides a novel approach to develop universal adenovirus vaccine candidates against all the other types of adenoviruses causing ards and perhaps other adenovirus-associated diseases
a community-wide outbreak of kawasaki syndrome apparently the first in the united states occurred in hawaii in the first half of 1978 twenty-seven of the 33 cases were subjected to intensive epidemiologic and microbiologic study patients with kawasaki syndrome compared to the general population more often had japanese ancestry high-income status and possibly a history of respiratory infection in the preceding month 44 %. staphylococcus aureus was not found in high frequency in the patients 15% and viral cultures and serologic studies immune electron microscopy and guinea pig and primate inoculation did not reveal a causative microorganism febrile illnesses in guinea pigs inoculated with a skin biopsy specimen could not be further passaged
the cross-species transmission of viruses into new host populations termed virus emergence is a significant issue in public health agriculture wildlife management and related fields virus emergence requires overlap between host populations alterations in virus genetics to permit infection of new hosts and adaptation to novel hosts such that between-host transmission is sustainable all of which are the purview of the fields of ecology and evolution a firm understanding of the ecology of viruses and how they evolve is required for understanding how and why viruses emerge in this paper i address the evolutionary mechanisms of virus emergence and how they relate to virus ecology i argue that while virus acquisition of the ability to infect new hosts is not difficult limited evolutionary trajectories to sustained virus between-host transmission and the combined effects of mutational meltdown bottlenecking demographic stochasticity density dependence and genetic erosion in ecological sinks limit most emergence events to dead-end spillover infections despite the relative rarity of pandemic emerging viruses the potential of viruses to search evolutionary space and find means to spread epidemically and the consequences of pandemic viruses that do emerge necessitate sustained attention to virus research surveillance prophylaxis and treatment

the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first recognized in 2012 and can cause severe disease in infected humans dromedary camels are the reservoir for the virus although other than nasal discharge these animals do not display any overt clinical disease data from in vitro experiments suggest that other livestock such as sheep goats and horses might also contribute to viral transmission although field data has not identified any seropositive animals in order to understand if these animals could be infected we challenged young goats and horses and adult sheep with mers-cov by intranasal inoculation minimal or no virus shedding was detected in all of the animals during the four weeks following inoculation neutralizing antibodies were detected in the young goats but not in sheep or horses
the genetically diverse orthocoronavirinae cov family is prone to cross species transmission and disease emergence in both humans and livestock viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future currently there are no approved therapeutics for any human cov presenting a clear unmet medical need remdesivir rdv gs-5734 is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of rna virus families including filoviridae paramyxoviridae pneumoviridae and orthocoronavirinae through the targeting of the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp we developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of rdv antiviral activity against the cov family here we show potent antiviral activity of rdv against endemic human covs oc43 hcov-oc43 and 229e hcov-229e with submicromolar ec 50 values of known covs the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent rdrp as compared to sars-and mers-cov and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the rdrp that confers resistance in beta-covs nevertheless rdv is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov these data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of rdv to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic cov and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging cov
several small animal models have been developed for the study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov replication and pathogenesis syrian golden hamsters are among the best small animal models though little clinical illness and no mortality are observed after virus infection cyclophosphamide was used to immunosuppress hamsters leading to a prolonged disease course and higher mortality after sars-cov infection in addition there was a significant weight loss expanded tissue tropism and increased viral pathology in the lung heart kidney and nasal turbinate tissues infection with recombinant sars-cov viruses bearing disruptions in the gene 7 coding region showed no significant change in replication kinetics tissue tropism morbidity or mortality suggesting that the orf7a 7a and orf7b 7b proteins are not required for virus replication in immunosuppressed hamsters this modified hamster model may provide a useful tool for sars-cov pathogenesis studies evaluation of antiviral therapy and analysis of additional sars-cov mutants
in this study the immunogenicity of chimeric 987p fimbriae on a salmonella vaccine strain was improved by optimizing fimbrial expression the constitutive teta promoter and the in vivo activated nirb and pagc promoters were evaluated for their use to express two epitopes of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev spike protein carried by fimbriae which were displayed on a salmonella vaccine strain constructs with the pagc promoter were shown to drive increased expression of chimeric 987p fimbriae in macrophages as well as in mg 2 + -poor media mimicking a major environmental signal found in salmonella-containing endocytic vacuoles of macrophages mice immunized orally with a salmonella vaccine strain which expressed chimeric fimbriae from the pagc promoter elicited significantly higher mucosal and systemic immune responses to both the 987p fimbriae and the tgev epitopes than mice immunized with the same strain hosting a teta or nirb promoter-driven expression plasmid moreover only the salmonella vaccine strains harboring a plasmid with the pagc promoter with or without an additional teta promoter in tandem elicited neutralizing antibodies to tgev this indicated that the pagc promoter can be used successfully to improve epitope-display by chimeric fimbriae on salmonella vaccine strains for the induction of a desired immune response
dengue fever is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female aedes mosquitoes dengue virus is a member of the flaviviridae family and human infection can be caused by any of the four antigenically distinct serotypes denv 1-4 the infection has become recognized as the most important and prevalent arboviral disease in humans endemic in almost 100 countries worldwide nearly 3 billion people live in areas with transmission risk autochthonous transmission of the virus in previously disease-free areas increased incidence in endemic areas and epidemic resurgence in controlled regions could increase the risk of contracting more severe forms of the disease such as dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf/dengue shock syndrome dss symptomatic dengue virus infection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations from mild fever to life-threatening dss thoracic complications may manifest as pleural effusion pneumonitis non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and hemorrhage/hemoptysis no vaccine is currently available and no specific treatment for dengue fever exists but prevention and prompt management of complications in patients with dhf can help reduce mortality this review describes the main clinical pathological and imaging findings of thoracic involvement in dhf
influenza a virus h1n1 which arose in 2009 constituted the fourth pandemic after the cases of 1918 1957 and 1968 this new variant was formed by a triple reassortment with genomic segments from swine avian and human influenza origins the objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin n=2038 and neuraminidase n=1273 genes in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains estimate if these genes evolved through positive negative or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs a continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential
to explore the possibility of developing a vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infection a recombinant swinepox virus rspv-sa expressing a tgev protective antigen has been constructed immune responses and protection efficacy of the vaccination vector were assessed in both mice and pig models an indirect elisa assay suggested that when mice were vaccinated with rspv-sa the level of igg against tgev was enhanced dramatically the cytokine assays were employed and the results indicated that both the th1-type and th2-type cytokine levels raised after vaccination with rspv-sa in mice models results from the passive immunity protection test of new born piglets demonstrated that the recombinant live-vector vaccine rspv-sa could 100% protect piglets from the spv infection and there was no significant clinical symptom in the rspv-sa treatment group during this experiment the data suggest that the novel recombinant swinepox virus is a potential vaccine against tgev infection
infectious bovine rhinothracheitis ibr caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 bohv-1 infection is distributed worldwide bohv-1 either alone or in association with other respiratory cattle pathogens causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry the aim of this work was to validate a guinea pig model as an alternative method to the current bohv-1 vaccine potency testing in calves guinea pigs were immunized with two doses of vaccine 21 days apart and sampled at 30 days post vaccination dpv bohv-1 antibody ab response to vaccination in guinea pigs measured by elisa and virus neutralization vn was statistically compared to the ab response in cattle the guinea pig model showed a dose-response relationship to the bovh-1 antigen concentration in the vaccine and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1 log 10 difference in its bohv-1 concentration with very good repeatability and reproducibility cv ≤ 20%. a regression analysis of the ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60 dpv respectively allowed us to classify vaccines in three potency categories "very satisfactory" "satisfactory" and "unsatisfactory". bovines immunized with vaccines corresponding to each of these three categories were experimentally challenged with bovh-1 virus the level of protection as measured by reduction of virus shedding and disease severity correlated well with the vaccine category used data generated by 85 experiments which included vaccination of calves and guinea pigs with 18 reference vaccines of known potency 8 placebos and 18 commercial vaccines was subjected to statistical analysis concordance analysis indicated almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for ab titers measured by elisa and almost perfect to substantial agreement when ab titers were measured by vn taken together these results indicate that the developed guinea pig model represents a novel and reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency and to predict efficacy of killed bohv-1 veterinary vaccines
specimens of blood collected in tecumseh michigan over a four-year period were studied for rise in antibody titer against coronavirus oc43 peaks of infection were found in the winter and spring of 1966 1968 and 1969 at other times infections occurred sporadically all age groups were involved especially the very young rises in titer by cf and by hal tests frequently did not occur together in the same individual agreement between the two tests was better in 1966 and 1969 than in the other years a portion of the paired specimens showing rises in cf and/ or hal titer was tested by neutralization rises in neutralizing antibody were usually found in pairs collected in 1966 and 1969 but not in those collected in 1967 and 1968 the infecting viruses in 1966 and 1969 thus appeared more closely related to oc43 than did those in 1967 and 1968
gastroenteritis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young and newborn animals and is often caused by multiple intestinal infections with rotavirus and bovine coronavirus bcov being the main viral causes in cattle given that bcov is better studied than equine coronaviruses and given the possibility of interspecies transmission of these viruses this research was designed to compare the partial sequences of the spike glycoprotein s hemagglutinin-esterase protein he and nucleoprotein n genes from coronaviruses from adult cattle with winter dysentery calves with neonatal diarrhea and horses to achieve this eleven fecal samples from dairy cows with winter dysentery three from calves and two from horses all from brazil were analysed it could be concluded that the enteric bcov genealogy from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographic distribution patterns when s and he genes are taken into account a less-resolved genealogy exists for the he and n genes in cattle with a trend for an age-related segregation pattern the coronavirus strains from horses revealed betacoronavirus sequences indistinguishable from those found in cattle a fact previously unknown
infectious bursal disease ibd continues to pose potential threat to poultry industry all over the world the disease can spell disaster not only through its infection but also by break of immunity in chickens vaccinated for other diseases l-arginine a ubiquitous semi-essential amino acid has emerged as an imunostimulant from variety of human and animal studies in the present study we demonstrate the stimulatory effects of l-arginine on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte iiels functions as well as on systemic immune response in chickens orally vaccinated with live intermediate plus ip strain of ibd vaccine challenge studies with virulent ibdv revealed complete 100% protection in ip + l-arginine group compared with 80% protection recorded in ip strain vaccinated chickens functional activities of iiels evaluated by cytotoxicity assay demonstrated significantly high percentage cytotoxicity in ip + l-arginine groups compared with ip group p < 0.05 proliferative response of iiels against ibdv antigen and con-a was also significantly higher in ip + l-arginine group similar results were obtained with peripheral blood mononuclear cell blastogenic response to ibdv and con-a analyzed as an indicator of systemic cell-mediated immune response orally administered ip strain vaccine elicited good antibody titres in both the groups ip and ip + l-arginine however the antibody titres were significantly higher in ip + l-arginine group compared with ip vaccinated group p < 0.05 these results clearly demonstrate that l-arginine stimulates intestinal and systemic immune response against ibdv
human papillomaviruses hpvs are formally described by isolation of their circular double-stranded dna genomes and establishment and comparison of the nucleotide sequence of these genomes alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of hpvs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible novel hpv isolates have traditionally been described as "types". the analysis of specific hpv types is of medical importance because hpv types typically induce type-specific lesions i e they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas recently it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses within the papillomavirus family closely or remotely related types form species or genera these formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses bacteria and higher organisms although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited notably however hpv types that are closely related i e form "species" are associated with similar lesions confusion of the terms "type" and "subtype" should be avoided as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages in contrast to many rna viruses hpv types evolve very slowly and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. these divergent isolates are called "variants". hpvs evolved together with humankind and homo sapiens was never without hpvs and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer variants of the same hpv type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers
we describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef pork and chicken purchased from stores in san francisco in beef we detected four previously reported viruses two parvoviruses belonging to different genera an anellovirus and one circovirus-like virus and one novel bovine polyomavirus species bpyv2-sf whose closest relatives infect primates detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect both ungulate species in pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three genera an anellovirus and pig circovirus 2 chicken meat contained numerous gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel gyrovirus species gyv7-sf our results provide an initial characterization of some of the viruses commonly found in us store-bought meats which included a diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular dna genomes whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing human sera for specific antibodies

background because the general population is largely naive to h5n1 infl uenza antibodies generated to h5 allow analysis of novel infl uenza vaccines independent of background immunity from previous infection we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of dna encoding h5 as a priming vaccine to improve antibody responses to inactivated infl uenza vaccination in vrc 306 and vrc 310 two sequentially enrolled phase 1 open-label randomised clinical trials healthy adults age 18-60 years were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular h5 dna 4 mg at day 0 or twice at day 0 and week 4 followed by h5n1 monovalent inactivated vaccine miv 90 μg at 4 or 24 weeks and compared with a twodose regimen of h5n1 miv with either a 4 or 24 week interval antibody responses were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition hai elisa neutralisation id 80 and immunoassays for stem-directed antibodies t cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining after enrolment investigators and individuals were not masked to group assignment vrc 306 and vrc 310 are registered with clinicaltrials gov numbers nct00776711 and nct01086657 respectively in vrc 306 60 individuals were randomly assigned to the four groups 15 in each and 59 received the vaccinations in vrc 310 of the 21 individuals enrolled 20 received the vaccinations nine received a two-dose regimen of h5n1 miv and 11 received h5 dna at day 0 followed by h5n1 miv at week 24 h5 dna priming was safe and enhanced h5-specifi c antibody titres following an h5n1 miv boost especially when the interval between dna prime and miv boost was extended to 24 weeks in the two studies dna priming with a 24-week miv boost interval induced protective hai titres in 21 81% of 26 of individuals with an increase in geometric mean titre gmt of more than four times that of individuals given the miv-miv regimen at 4 or 24 weeks gmt 103-206 vs gmt 27-33 additionally neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of h5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals no vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded interpretation dna priming 24 weeks in advance of infl uenza vaccine boosting increased the magnitude of protective antibody responses hai and in some cases induced haemagglutinin-stem-specifi c neutralising antibodies a dna-miv vaccine regimen could enhance the effi cacy of h5 or other infl uenza vaccines and shows that anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in man
four pigs group 1 were infected with an aerosol containing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv followed 7 days later by pseudorabies virus prv three further pigs group 2 received prrsv alone two group 3 received prv alone and two group 4 remained as uninfected controls despite the admittedly small numbers of animals the experiment appeared to throw light on aspects of synergy thus the group 1 pigs showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors total cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in all prrsvinfected pigs and prrsv antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages total cell numbers in the cerebrospinal fluid of group 1 pigs were considerably greater than those demonstrated in group 3 but no prv antigen was found pigs of groups 1 and 2 showed pulmonary lesions characterized by interstitial pneumonia and prrsv antigen immunolabelling non-suppurative encephalitis was found in five of the six pigs of groups 1 and 3 in particular one group 1 animal had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies and associated immunolabelling of prv antigen the other three group 1 pigs had prominent malacic lesions with macrophages these neuropathological findings strongly suggested that prrsv infection in pigs enhances the severity of brain lesions caused prv q
biological and morphological properties of ~ virus isolated from the intestine of infant mice with clinical signs of diarrhea and designated as diarrhea virus of infant mice dvim were examined the first infective virus was detected on the cells 4 hours post infection followed by rapid release of the virus into the culture fluids virus-induced syncytia in balb/c-3t3 cell cultures caused hemadsorption at 4 ° c and viral antigens were shown to be located in the cytoplasm of the syncy~ia by immunofluorescent techniques by scanning electron-microscopy budding virus-like particles were detected on the surface of virus-induced syncytia morphologically the virus was shown to be enveloped and approximately 100 nm in diameter two types of projections were demonstrated one type of projection was club-shaped 20 nm in length and the other type was small granular 5 nm in length the latter type of projection might be the basal part of the clubshaped type and related to the hemagglutinating activity
coronaviruses are well known for their potential to change their host or tissue tropism resulting in unpredictable new diseases and changes in pathogenicity severe acute respiratory syndrome and feline coronaviruses respectively are the most recognized examples feline coronaviruses occur as 2 pathotypes nonvirulent feline enteric coronaviruses fecvs which replicate in intestinal epithelium cells and lethal feline infectious peritonitis viruses fipvs which replicate in macrophages evidence indicates that fipv originates from fecv by mutation but consistent distinguishing differences have not been established we sequenced the full genome of 11 viruses of each pathotype and then focused on the single most distinctive site by additionally sequencing hundreds of viruses in that region as a result we identifi ed 2 alternative amino acid differences in the putative fusion peptide of the spike protein that together distinguish fipv from fecv in >95% of cases by these and perhaps other mutations the virus apparently acquires its macrophage tropism and spreads systemically
leptospirosis is a serious infection disease caused by pathogenic strains of the leptospira spirochetes which affects not only humans but also animals it has long been expected to find an effective vaccine to prevent leptospirosis through immunization of high risk humans or animals although some leptospirosis vaccines have been obtained the vaccination is relatively unsuccessful in clinical application despite decades of research and millions of dollars spent in this review the recent advancements of recombinant outer membrane protein omp vaccines lipopolysaccharide lps vaccines inactivated vaccines attenuated vaccines and dna vaccines against leptospirosis are reviewed a comparison of these vaccines may lead to development of new potential methods to combat leptospirosis and facilitate the leptospirosis vaccine research moreover a vaccine ontology database was built for the scientists working on the leptospirosis vaccines as a starting tool
we tested the efficacy of coronavirus-like particles vlps for protecting mice against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus scov infection coexpression of scov s protein and e m and n proteins of mouse hepatitis virus in 293t or cho cells resulted in the efficient production of chimeric vlps carrying scov s protein balb/c mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric vlps and alum twice at an interval of four weeks were protected from scov challenge as indicated by the absence of infectious virus in the lungs the same groups of mice had high levels of scov-specific neutralizing antibodies while mice in the negative control groups which were not immunized with chimeric vlps failed to manifest neutralizing antibodies suggesting that scov-specific neutralizing antibodies are important for the suppression of viral replication within the lungs despite some differences in the cellular composition of inflammatory infiltrates we did not observe any overt lung pathology in the chimeric-vlptreated mice when compared to the negative control mice our results show that chimeric vlp can be an effective vaccine strategy against scov infection

feline leukemia virus felv and feline immunodeficiency virus fiv are retroviruses with global impact on the health of domestic cats the two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease felv is more pathogenic and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats felv can cause tumors mainly lymphoma bone marrow suppression syndromes mainly anemia and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system today felv is less commonly diagnosed than in the previous 20 years prevalence has been decreasing in most countries however felv importance may be underestimated as it has been shown that regressively infected cats that are negative in routinely used felv tests also can develop clinical signs fiv can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of opportunistic infections neurological diseases and tumors in most naturally infected cats however fiv itself does not cause severe clinical signs and fiv-infected cats may live many years without any health problems this article provides a review of clinical syndromes in progressively and regressively felv-infected cats as well as in fiv-infected cats
attaching and effacing escherichia coli are involved in diarrhea in 2 to 8-week old calves the virulence factors of these bacteria include i the secretion of proteins i e espb involved in microvilli effacement ii the production of the intimin a 94 kda outer membrane protein encoded by the eaea gene and involved in the intimate attachment of bacteria to epithelial cell and iii the production of verotoxins vt1 and/or vt2 we investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by genetic amplification using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5% of calves who died from diarrhea presented eaea e coli strains and secondly that 19% of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage however using colony hybridization and genetic amplification we identified eaea strains in 91% of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems in 66% of the calves there was a correlation between the presence of aeec and diarrhea at the pathotype level most of the eaea isolates were negative for vt probes in vt bacteria the majority were vt1 the number of vt positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves this underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease moreover only 25% of the bovine aeec were positive with the eaeb probe surprisingly the proportion of eaeb strains was significantly higher in healthy calves than in other populations # 1998 elsevier science b v all rights reserved
studies from eastern european countries proved that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 prrsv-1 harbours high genetic diversity and that genetically divergent subtypes 2-4 circulate in this area in the present study we compared the pathogenicity of two different prrsv-1 subtype 2 strains and a strain representing prrsv-1 subtype 1 four groups of 8-week-old specific pathogen free pigs were either infected with subtype 2 strain ili6 subtype 2 strain or bor59 subtype 1 strain 18794 or mock inoculated the most pronounced clinical signs were observed in pigs infected with bor59 pigs from both subtype 2 strain infected groups exhibited significantly elevated mean body temperatures on dpi 2 compared to the other two groups the difference remaining significant up to dpi 13 for the bor59 group only the pigs in the latter group also displayed significantly highest levels of early viremia together with the most rapid app response overall the results indicated that bor59 strain can be considered a highly pathogenic strain similarly to subtype 3 strains lena and su1-bel while the virulence of the other subtype 2 strain ili6 was intermediate between bor59 and subtype 1 strain

in march 2013 three fatal human cases of infection with influenza a virus h7n9 were reported in china since then human cases have been accumulating given the public health importance of this virus we performed a pathogenicity study of the h7n9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model focusing on clinical aspects of disease radiographic histological and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection cynomolgus macaques developed transient mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans albeit less severe with diffuse alveolar damage infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells formation of hyaline membranes pneumocyte hyperplasia and fibroproliferative changes analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during h7n9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication overall h7n9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human h7n9 infection h n gao et al n engl h7n9 virus-induced disease in humans is often very severe and even lethal the majority of reported h7n9 cases occurred in older people and people with underlying medical conditions to better understand the pathogenicity of this virus healthy cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with influenza a virus h7n9 cynomolgus macaques were used as a model because the receptor distribution for h7n9 virus in macaques was recently shown to be more similar to that in humans than that of other frequently used animal models from comparison with previous studies we conclude that the emerging h7n9 influenza virus was more pathogenic in cynomolgus macaques than seasonal influenza a viruses and most isolates of the pandemic h1n1 virus but less pathogenic than the 1918 spanish influenza virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 virus
influenza a viruses causes a variety of illnesses in humans the most common infection seasonal influenza is usually a mild self-limited febrile syndrome but it can be more severe in infants the elderly and immunodeficient persons in whom it can progress to severe viral pneumonitis or be complicated by bacterial superinfection leading to pneumonia and sepsis seasonal influenza also occasionally results in neurologic complications rarely viruses that have spread from wild birds to domestic poultry can infect humans such "avian influenza" can range in severity from mild conjunctivitis through the rapidly lethal disease seen in persons infected with the h5n1 virus that first emerged in hong kong in 1997 to develop effective therapies for this wide range of diseases it is essential to have laboratory animal models that replicate the major features of illness in humans this review describes models currently in use for elucidating influenza pathogenesis and evaluating new therapeutic agents
many human viral infections have a zoonotic i e wild or domestic animal origin several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod if a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host human-to-human transmissions may occur possibly resulting in an epidemic such as the a/h1n1 flu pandemic in 2009 thus predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades the recent development of viral metagenomics i e the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans in this review we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals in particular blood-feeding arthropods wildlife and domestic animals using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases
virus-like particles vlps present viral antigens in a native conformation and are effectively recognized by the immune system and therefore are considered as suitable and safe vaccine candidates against many viral diseases here we demonstrate that chimeric vlps containing rift valley fever virus rvfv glycoproteins g n and g c nucleoprotein n and the gag protein of moloney murine leukemia virus represent an effective vaccine candidate against rift valley fever a deadly disease in humans and livestock long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses are demonstrated in a mouse model by the analysis of neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine secretion profiles vaccine efficacy studies were performed in mouse and rat lethal challenge models resulting in high protection rates taken together these results demonstrate that replication-incompetent chimeric rvf vlps are an efficient rvfv vaccine candidate
live virus vaccines are commonly used in poultry production particularly in broilers massive application and generation of a protective local mucosal and humoral immunity with no adverse effects is the main goal for this strategy live virus vaccines can be improved by adding adjuvants to boost mucosal innate and adaptive responses in a previous study we showed that diatomaceous earth de can be used as adjuvant in inactivated vaccines the aim of this study was to test de as adjuvant in an ark-dpi live infectious bronchitis virus ibv vaccine after ocular or spray application titrating the virus alone or after addition of de showed that de had no detrimental effect on the vaccine virus how-ever adding de to the vaccine did not induce higher igg titers in the serum and iga titers in tears it also did not affect the frequency of cd4 + t cells cd8 + t cells and monocytes/macrophages in the blood and the spleen determined by flow cytometry in addition protection generated against ibv homologous challenges measured by viral load in tears respiratory signs and histopathology in tracheas did not vary when de was present in the vaccine formulation finally we confirmed through our observations that ark vaccines administered by hatchery spray cabinet elicit weaker immune responses and protection against an ibv homologous challenge compared to the same vaccine delivered via ocular route
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has catastrophic impacts on the global pig industry although the fecal-oral route is generally accepted an increased number of reports indicate that airborne transmission may contribute to pedv outbreak here we show that pedv could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray firstly pedv can develop a transient nasal epithelium infection subsequently pedv-carrying dendritic cells dcs allow the virus to be transferred to cd3 + t cells via the virological synapse finally virus-loaded cd3 + t cells reach the intestine through the blood circulation leading to intestinal infection via cellto-cell contact our study provides evidence for airborne transmission of a gastrointestinal infected coronavirus and illustrates the mechanism of its transport from the entry site to the pathogenic site
in this study infrared thermography irt was assessed as a means of detecting foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv-infected cattle before and after the development of clinical signs preliminary irt imaging demonstrated that foot temperatures increased in fmdvinfected animals the maximum foot temperatures of healthy n = 53 directly inoculated di n = 12 contact ct n = 6 and vaccine trial vt n = 21 cattle were measured over the course of fmd infection a cut-off value was established at 34.4°c sensitivity = 61.1% specificity = 87.7% with the aim of detecting fmdv-infected animals both before and after clinical signs were observed seven of 12 58% di and 3/6 50% ct animals showed maximum foot temperatures exceeding the 34.4°c cut-off before the development of foot vesicles in contrast only 5/21 24% vt animals displayed pre-clinical foot temperatures above this cut-off possibly indicating partial vaccine protection of this group these results show irt as a promising screening technology to quickly identify potentially infected animals for confirmatory diagnostic testing during fmd outbreaks further evaluation of this technology is needed to determine the value of irt in detecting animals with mild clinical signs or sub-clinical infections published by elsevier ltd
red foxes vulpes vulpes are susceptible to viral diseases of domestic carnivores in this study by screening rectal swabs collected from 34 red foxes in italy we identified kobuvirus rna in five samples based on analysis of partial rdrp and full-length vp1 genes all of the strains shared the highest identity with canine kobuviruses cakvs recently detected in the us the uk and italy these findings provide the first evidence of the circulation of these novel viruses in foxes picornaviruses are small non-enveloped viruses of approximately 27-30 nm in diameter with single-stranded positive-polarity rna genomes of 8.2-8.4 kb according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses http//ictvonline org/virustaxonomy aspversion=2012 the family picornaviridae is currently divided into 17 genera the genus kobuvirus consists of three species aichivirus a formerly aichi virus aichivirus b formerly bovine kobuvirus and aichivirus c porcine kobuvirus human aichi virus aiv was first recognized in 1989 as the cause of oyster-associated nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans in aichi prefecture japan . several investigations worldwide have revealed that aivs are involved in 0.9-4.1 % of sporadic cases of pediatric gastroenteritis .novel kobuviruses that are genetically and antigenically closely related to human aivs have been found recently in domestic carnivores raising public health concerns of potential cross-species transmission carnivore kobuviruses were first discovered in diarrhoeic and asymptomatic dogs . based on sequence analysis of the complete genome the novel virus designated canine kobuvirus cakv was found to be genetically closest to the recently identified mouse kobuvirus m-5/usa/2010 84.0 % amino acid sequence identity and to human aivs 80.0 % aa sequence identity accordingly cakv may be considered a distinct genotype cakv type 1 from both murine kobuvirus mukv type 1 and human aiv aiv type 1 within the species aichivirus a http//ictvonline org/pro posals/2012.014av a v1 kobuvirus-spren pdf subsequently kobuviruses that are genetically related to cakvs were identified in the faecal samples of cats with diarrhoea . nucleotide sequence identity between cakvs and feline kobuviruses in the rdrp region ranged from 82.2 % to 89.3 % while identity to mukv and to human aiv was 82.4-85.5 % and 81.9-82.4 % respectively also a novel kobuvirus more close related to bovine and ovine kobuviruses within the species aichivirus b has been identified recently in a rectal swab from a ferret
background constant treatment regimens with toltrazuril against cystoisospora suis infection in piglets are being applied in the intensive production systems for the last two decades but the possibility of resistance development has not been addressed so far despite limited availability of treatment alternatives recently a pig producer in the netherlands who routinely used toltrazuril complained about diarrhea in suckling piglets in the absence of bacterial and viral pathogens and oocysts of c suis could be isolated from feces of affected litters methods piglets from two litters were infected with a field isolate of c suis holland-i and treated with 0 holl-ctrl 20 holl-20 or 30 holl-30 mg/kg of body weight bw of toltrazuril baycox®. the efficacy of toltrazuril was measured by assessment of oocyst excretion fecal consistency and bw gain a separate litter was infected with a toltrazurilsusceptible strain of c suis wien-i and treated with 0 wien-ctrl or 20 wien-20 mg/kg bw of toltrazuril for comparison results treatment with the recommended 20 mg/kg dose of toltrazuril completely suppressed oocyst shedding and diarrhea in group wien-20 the prevalence of oocyst excretion was 100% in the groups infected with holland-i and 80% in the group wien-ctrl most days with diarrhea were observed in group holl-20 with an average of 6.40% followed by 5.71% in wien-ctrl while in holl-ctrl and holl-30 diarrhea was only seen in 1.79% of the samples n = 14/piglet oocyst excretion fecal consistency and bw gain did not differ significantly among groups infected with holland-i indicating loss of efficacy to toltrazuril conclusion experimental infections and treatment confirmed toltrazuril resistance against the field isolate even at increased dosage such isolates are a potential threat to pig production as no other effective and economically sustainable alternative treatment is currently available in the absence of a standardized protocol for resistance testing in c suis regular parasitological examination and if possible experimental confirmation should be considered to evaluate the extent and consequences of toltrazuril resistance
bartonella henselae has been implicated as a causative agent of chronic uveitis in people and in some cats the objective of this study was to determine whether bartonella species seroprevalence or titer magnitude varies among cats with uveitis cats without ocular diseases recorded and healthy cats while controlling for age and risk of flea exposure based on state of residence there was no difference in seroprevalence rates or titer magnitude between cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular diseases healthy cats were more likely to be seropositive for bartonella species than cats with uveitis the median bartonella species titer was 164 for all groups although healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular disease the results suggest that serum antibody tests alone cannot be used to document clinical uveitis associated with bartonella species infection
interest in bat-related viruses has increased considerably during the last decade leading to the discovery of a rising number of new viruses in several bat species poxviridae are a large diverse family of dna viruses that can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates to date only a few documented detections of poxviruses have been described in bat populations on three different continents america africa and australia these viruses are phylogenetically dissimilar and have diverse clinical impacts on their hosts herein we report the isolation nearly complete genome sequencing and annotation of a novel poxvirus detected from an insectivorous bat hypsugo savii in northern italy the virus is tentatively named hypsugopoxvirus hypv after the bat species from which it was isolated the nearly complete genome size is 166600 nt and it encodes 161 genes genome analyses suggest that hypv belongs to the chordopoxvirinae subfamily with the highest nucleotide identity 85% to eptesipoxvirus eptv detected from a microbat eptesicus fuscus in wa usa in 2011 to date hypv represents the first poxvirus detected in bats in europe thus its viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated further
twenty 6-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs were divided into four groups on day 0 of the experiment prrsv-prv n ¼ 6 and prrsv n ¼ 4 groups were intranasally inoculated with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv 10 5.6 tcid 50 . on day 7 the prrsv-prv and prv n ¼ 6 groups were intranasally inoculated with pseudorabies virus prv 10 3.6 tcid 50 . control pigs n ¼ 4 were kept as uninoculated negative controls half of the pigs in each group were euthanized and necropsied on day 14 or 21 clinical signs such as depression and anorexia were observed in the prrsv-prv and prv groups after inoculation with prv although febrile response was observed after virus inoculations the duration of that response was prolonged in the prrsv-prv group compared with the other groups the lungs in the prrsv-prv group failed to collapse and were mottled or diffusely tan and red whereas the lungs of the pigs in the other groups were grossly normal histopathologically interstitial pneumonia was present in all prrsv-inoculated pigs but the pneumonic lesions were more severe in the prrsv-prv group mean prrsv titres of tonsil and lung in the prrsv-prv group were significantly p < 0.05 higher than that in the prrsv group on day 21 these results indicate that dual infection with prrsv and prv increased clinical signs and pneumonic lesions in pigs infected with both viruses as compared to pigs infected with prrsv or prv only at least in the present experimental conditions
background sustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans the ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production while vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses methodology / principal findings the ability of dna vaccines encoding hemagglutinin ha proteins from different hpai h5n1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous hpai h5n1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after dna immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device these vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of hpai h5n1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 has the response was dose-dependent and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus ha in the vaccine monovalent and trivalent ha vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal h5n1 a/vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination in chickens protection was observed against heterologous strains of hpai h5n1 after vaccination with a trivalent h5 serotype dna vaccine with doses as low as 5 mg dna given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device conclusions/significance dna vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species in addition the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates this is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons public domain declaration which stipulates that once placed in the public domain this work may be freely reproduced distributed transmitted modified built upon or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose
hepatitis e virus hev genus orthohepevirus is a common cause of hepatitis worldwide human-infecting hev strains orthohepevirus a include human-restricted and enzootic genotypes viruses in the orthohepevirus a species also infect rabbits hev-3ra camels and swine using a selection-informed method we dated the origin of the orthohepevirus genus at least 21 million years ago whereas the orthohepevirus a species originated in asia most likely from a humaninfecting ancestor that existed~4500 to 6800 years ago in this period the appearance of large human settlements probably facilitated hev emergence and spread the earliest events in orthohepevirus a evolutionary history involved the separation of the enzootic and human-restricted genotypes as well as the split of the camel-infecting genotypes which occurred during the time-frame of camel domestication the place and timing of hev-3ra divergence also correspond to the circumstances of rabbit domestication this study clarifies the origin and historical events underlying hev dispersal
the induction of immunological memory which is mediated by memory t and b cells is central to adaptive protective immunity to pathogens induced by previous infection and is the cornerstone of effective vaccine design recent studies in mice have suggested that memory t cells that accumulate in tissues termed tissue-resident memory t trm cells play a crucial role in maintaining long-term protective immunity to mucosal pathogens cd4 and cd8 trm cells can be induced following infection at mucosal sites or the skin where they are maintained and poised to respond rapidly to reinfection with the same pathogen trm cells can also be generated by vaccination but their induction is influenced by a number of factors including the type of vaccine the adjuvant and the route of immunization live attenuated vaccines appear to be more effective than killed or subunit vaccines at inducing trm cells and mucosal immunization especially by intranasal route is more effective than parenteral delivery however evidence is emerging that formulation of killed or subunit vaccines with novel adjuvants especially those that generate th1 and th17 responses can promote the induction of trm cells while trm cells are also present at high number in mucosal tissues in humans one of the challenge will be to develop methodologies for routine quantification of these cells in humans nevertheless the identification of approaches for optimum induction of trm cells in mice should assist in the design of more effective vaccines that sustain protective immunity against a range of human pathogens
in this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity to illustrate the proof of principle of this novel vaccination strategy we use the model organism of intracellular immunity listeria we introduced a low copy number bac-plasmid harbouring the virulence gene cluster vgc of l monocytogenes lm into the non-pathogenic l innocua l inn strain and examined for its ability to induce protective cellular immunity the resulting strain l innvgc was attenuated for virulence in vivo and showed a strongly reduced host detrimental inflammatory response compared to lm like lm l innvgc induced the production of type i interferon's and protection was mediated by listeria-specific cd8 + t cells rational vaccine design whereby avirulent strains are equipped with the capabilities to induce protection but lack detrimental inflammatory effects offer great promise towards future studies using non-pathogenic bacteria as vectors for vaccination citation mohamed w sethi s tchatalbachev s darji a chakraborty t 2012 protective immunity to listeria monocytogenes infection mediated by recombinant listeria innocua harboring the vgc locus plos one 74 e35503
newborn colostrum-restricted calves were orally inoculated with an escherichia coli strain identified originally as non-pathogenic and into which the plasmid pvir was conjugally transferred this resulted in diarrhea intestinal lesions and extra-intestinal invasion suggesting that factors affecting these pathogenic properties are located on pvir in order to analyze the respective roles of the toxins cnf2 and cdtiii in the pathogenesis colostrum-restricted calves were inoculated with isogenic mutants in the cnf2 and the cdt-iii genes the loss of cnf2 is associated with a reduction in the pathogenicity since diarrhea does not occur in calves challenged in spite of successful colonization of the intestine nevertheless the mutant strain remains able to invade the bloodstream and to localize in the internal organs conversely the calves inoculated with mutant in the cdt-iii gene evolved in the same way as wild-type strain-inoculated calves with regard to clinical signs and macroscopic or microscopic lesions
the aim of this study was to identify the receptors for prrsv on porcine alveolar macrophages pams by producing monoclonal antibodies mabs against these cells hybridoma supernatants were selected for their ability to block prrsv infection four mabs 1-8d2 9.4c7 9.9f2 and 3-3h2 inhibited infection and recognised cell surface pam-specific antigens as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay these mabs were then used to identify cellular proteins involved in prrsv infection by radioimmunoprecipitation assays ripas mabs 1-8d2 and 9.9f2 each recognised a 150 kda-polypeptide doublet while mabs 9.4c7 and 3-3h2 both recognised a 220 kda-polypeptide glycosidase treatment demonstrated all these polypeptides to be n-glycosylated thus multiple glycoproteins appear to be involved in infection of pams by prrsv * porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus prrsv is an enveloped positive stranded rna virus and a member of the arteriviridae family other members of this family are equine arteritis virus eav lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus ldv and simian haemorrhagic fever virus shfv . prrsv has a highly restricted tropism for macrophages particularly for porcine alveolar macrophages pams both in vivo and in vitro . recently prrsv was also shown to replicate in testicular germ cells . the only non-porcine cells known to support prrsv replication are the african green monkey kidney
vaccines for the swine flu pandemic of 2009 have been produced in an exquisitely short time frame this speed of production comes because of 50 years of hard work by virologists worldwide in pharma groups research laboratories and government licensing units the present chapter presents the background framework of influenza vaccine production and its evolution over 50 years isolation of the causative virus of influenza in 1933 followed by the discovery of embryonated hen eggs as a substrate quickly led to the formulation of vaccines virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin the phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus ha was soon recognized and as who began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including m2e and np as "universal" vaccines covering all virus subtypes recent technical innovations have been the use of vero and mdck cells as the virus cell substrate the testing of two new adjuvants and the exploration of new presentations to the nose or epidermal layers as dna or antigen mixtures the international investment into public health measures for a global human outbreak of avian h5n1 influenza together with a focus of swine influenza h1n1 is leading to enhanced production of conventional vaccine and to a new research searchlight on t-cell epitope vaccines viral liveattenuated carriers of influenza proteins and even more innovative substrates to cultivate virus including plant cells
antibodies are an important component in host immune responses to viral pathogens because of their unique maturation process antibodies can evolve to be highly specific to viral antigens physicians and researchers have been relying on such high specificity in their quest to understand host-viral interaction and viral pathogenesis mechanisms and to find potential cures for viral infection and disease with more than 60 recombinant monoclonal antibodies developed for human use in the last 20 years monoclonal antibodies are now considered a viable therapeutic modality for infectious disease targets including newly emerging viral pathogens such as ebola representing heightened public health concerns as well as pathogens that have long been known such as human cytomegalovirus here we summarize some recent advances in identification and characterization of monoclonal antibodies suitable as drug candidates for clinical evaluation and review some promising candidates in the development pipeline
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreaks in the arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region raising the concern that a global pandemic could occur here we show that a dna vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids s1 of mers-cov spike s protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice with three immunizations high titers of neutralizing antibodies up to 1 10 4 were generated without adjuvant dna vaccination with the mers-cov s1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen-specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cells secreting ifn-γ and other cytokines both pcdna3.1-s1 dna vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcdna3.1-s1 vaccinated mice protected ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice
despite the pioneering efforts to identify correlates of passive immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev effective vaccines for the control of tge in suckling pigs have remained elusive the initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies oflactogenic immunity to tgev in swine these studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent tgev stimulated high titers of siga antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against tge parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed tgev vaccines induced mainly igg antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs the recent appearance of prcv infections in swine and continuing studies of tgev infections present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for tgev is the stimulation of galt through intestinal virus replication studies addressing the contribution of balt to immunity to tgev and prcv may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches the mechanism by which exposure to prcv elicits a variable degree of immunity to tgev challenge is unknown virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites i e galt to balt and balt to galt migration further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to tgev and prcv that affect the distribution patterns of igm- iggand iga-antibody-secreting cells asc and t lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against tgev challenge
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus a pathogen first detected in us domestic swine in 2013 has rapidly spilled over into feral swine populations a better understanding of the factors associated with pathogen emergence is needed to better manage and ultimately prevent future spillover events from domestic to nondomestic animals

bat-borne viruses can pose a serious threat to human health with examples including nipah virus niv in bangladesh and malaysia and marburg virus marv in africa to date significant human outbreaks of such viruses have not been reported in the european union eu however eu countries have strong historical links with many of the countries where niv and marv are present and a corresponding high volume of commercial trade and human travel which poses a potential risk of introduction of these viruses into the eu in assessing the risks of introduction of these bat-borne zoonotic viruses to the eu it is important to consider the location and range of bat species known to be susceptible to infection together with the virus prevalence seasonality of viral pulses duration of infection and titre of virus in different bat tissues in this paper we review the current scientific knowledge of all these factors in relation to the introduction of niv and marv into the eu
in 1997 avian influenza virus h5n1 was transmitted directly from chicken to human and resulted in a severe disease that had a higher mortality rate in adults than in children the characteristic mononuclear leukocyte infiltration in the lung and the high inflammatory response in h5n1 infection prompted us to compare the chemokine responses between influenza virus-infected adult and neonatal monocyte-derived macrophages mdms the effects of avian influenza virus a/hong kong/483/97 h5n1 h5n1/97 its precursor a/quail/ hong kong/g1/97 h9n2 h9n2/g1 and human influenza virus a/hong kong/54/98 h1n1 h1n1/98 were compared significantly higher expression of ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 and cxcl10 was induced by avian influenza viruses than by human influenza virus moreover the increase in ccl3 expression in h5n1/97infected adult mdms was significantly higher than that in neonatal mdms enhanced expression of ccr1 and ccr5 was found in avian virus-infected adult mdms the strong induction of chemokines and their receptors by avian influenza viruses particularly in adult mdms may account for the severity of h5n1 disease
anti-toxoplasma gondii antibodies were determined in serum and aqueous humor of two groups of cats in france cats with uveitis group 1 n = 26 and cats with systemic disease group 2 n = 24 using an agglutination test titres above 164 were considered positive igg antibodies to t gondii were detected in 10 serum samples from group 1 and in 10 serum samples from group 2 and in 2 aqueous humor samples from group 1 and in 1 aqueous humor samples from group 2 the distribution of ocular lesions according to the serological status of the animals indicated that lens luxation and buphthalmia were more frequent in t gondii seropositive cats than in seronegative ones the study reports a similar prevalence of anti-t gondii antibodies in cats with uveitis and in cats without uveitis in france serological results must be analysed carefully and additional diagnostic tools is required #
introduction inovirus-associated vectors iavs are derived from bacterial filamentous viruses phages as vaccine carriers they have elicited both cellular and humoral responses against a variety of pathogens causing infectious diseases and other non-infectious diseases by displaying specific antigen epitopes or proteins on their coat proteins iavs have merited much study as their unique abilities are exploited for widespread vaccine development areas covered the architectural traits of filamentous viruses and their derivatives iavs facilitate the display of specific antigenic peptides which induce antibody production to prevent or curtail infection inoviruses provide a foundation for cost-efficient large-scale specific phage display in this paper the development of different applications of inovirus-based phage display vaccines across a broad range of pathogens and hosts is reviewed the references cited in this review were selected from established databases based on the authors' knowledge of the study subject expert commentary the importance of phage-display technology has been recently highlighted by the nobel prize in chemistry 2018 awarded to george p smith and sir gregory p winter furthermore the symbiotic nature of filamentous viruses infecting intestinal f + e coli strains offers an attractive platform for the development of novel vaccines that stimulate mucosal immunity article history
only a minority of rna viruses that can infect humans are capable of spreading in human populations independently of a zoonotic reservoir this is especially true of vector-borne rna viruses the majority of these are not transmissible via the vector between humans at all understanding the biology underlying this observation will help us evaluate the public health risk associated with novel vector-borne rna viruses

sars-cov-2 a global pandemic originated from wuhan city of china in the month of december 2019 there is an urgency to identify potential antibodies to neutralize the virus and also as a diagnostic tool candidate at present palliative treatments using existing antiviral drugs are under trails to treat sars-cov-2 whole genome sequence of wuhan market sample of sars-cov-2 was obtained from ncbi gene id mn908947.3 spike protein sequence pdb id 6vsb obtained from rcsb database spike protein sequence had shown top v gene match with iglv1-44*01 iglv1-47*02 and has vl type chain whole genome sequence had shown top v gene match with ighv1-38-4*01 and has vh type chain vd chain had shown link to allele hla-a0206 80% hla-a0217 80% hla-a2301 75% hla-a0203 75% hla-a0202 70% and hla-a0201 55% of binding levels some conserved regions of spike protein had shown strong binding affinity with hla-a-0*201 hla-a24 hla-b-5701 and hla-b-5703 alpha chains synthetic fab construct bcr type antibody igg cr5840 had shown polyspecific binding activity with spike glycoprotein when compared with available anti-sars antibody cr3022 thus we propose cr5840 fab constructed antibody as potential neutralizing antibody for sars-cov-2 based on germline analysis we also propose cytotoxic t lymphocyte epitope peptide selective system as effective tool for the development of sars-cov-2 vaccine
severe acute respiratory syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002-2003 epidemic many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in balb/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus ma15 which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality here we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells rdc to the draining lymph nodes dln with a consequent deficient virus-specific t cell response all of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate which deplete alveolar macrophages am inhibitory ams are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and t cells the inhibitory effects of am can also be nullified if mice or ams are pretreated with poly ic which directly activate ams and rdcs through toll-like receptors 3 tlr3 further adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdc protect mice from lethal ma15 infection these results may be relevant for sars in humans which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a sars-covspecific immune response in individuals with severe disease
neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle among enteropathogens cryptosporidium spp are primary causes of diarrhea but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle from january to april in 2016 severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province of east china approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy in this study 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay eia in a post-outbreak investigation 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp by eia and pcr respectively to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm cryptosporidium spp were genotyped using established techniques initial eia tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for cryptosporidium parvum while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus the overall infection rate of cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7% with odds of the cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak four cryptosporidium spp were identified after the outbreak including c parvum n = 79 cryptosporidium ryanae n = 48 cryptosporidium bovis n = 31 and cryptosporidium andersoni n = 3 with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals infection with c parvum 73/79 was found in the majority of calves aged 3 weeks consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak all c parvum isolates were identified as subtype iida19g1 in the post-outbreak investigation c parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves c ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre-and post-weaned calves while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that c bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves thus we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by c parvum iida19g1 in dairy calves more attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in china.ó
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by a novel coronavirus cov sars-cov in previous studies we showed that a sars-cov spike s glycoproteinbased modified vaccinia ankara mva-s vaccine could induce strong neutralizing antibody nab response which might have played a critical role in protecting chinese rhesus monkeys from the pathogenic viral challenge to date however it remains unknown what the minimal level of nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans it is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of nab response in vivo here we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of dna-s mva-s and adenovirus type 5 ad5-s vaccines we show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits a heterologous mva-s prime with ad5-s boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of nab response when compared with other combinations interestingly the initial level of nab after prime does not necessarily predict the magnitude of the secondary response after the boost thus our data provides a promising optimal regimen for vaccine development in humans against sars-cov infection
gynecological cancers are a leading cause of mortality in women cd8 + t cell immunity largely correlates with enhanced survival whereas inflammation is associated with poor prognosis previous studies have shown polystyrene nanoparticles psnps are biocompatible do not induce inflammation and when used as vaccine carriers for model peptides induce cd8 + t cell responses herein we test the immunogenicity of 24 different peptides from three leading vaccine target proteins in gynecological cancers the e7 protein of human papilloma virus hpv wilms tumor antigen 1 wt1 and survivin sv in psnp conjugate vaccines of relevance to vaccine development was the finding that a minimal cd8 + t cell peptide epitope from hpv was not able to induce hla-a2.1 specific cd8 + t cell responses in transgenic humanized mice using conventional adjuvants such as cpg but was nevertheless able to generate strong immunity when delivered as part of a specific longer peptide conjugated to psnps vaccines conversely in most cases when the minimal cd8 + t cell epitopes were able to induce immune responses with wt1 or sv super agonists in cpg they also induced responses when conjugated to psnps in this case extending the sequence around the cd8 + t cell epitope using the natural protein context or engineering linker sequences proposed to enhance antigen processing had minimal effects in enhancing or changing the cross-reactivity pattern induced by the super agonists nanoparticle approaches such as psnps therefore may offer an alternative vaccination strategy when conventional adjuvants are unable to elicit the desired cd8 + t cell specificity the findings herein also offer sequence specific insights into peptide vaccine design for nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers
the aim of our experiment was to study how synbiotics are able to deal with the problems of post-weaning piglets lactobacillus plantarum -biocenol tm lp96 ccm 7512 lactobacillus fermentum -biocenol tm lf99 ccm 7514 and flaxseed rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were administered to 36 conventional piglets from a problematic breed with confirmed presence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and coronavirus the experimental piglets were supplied with probiotic cheeses and crushed flax-seed in the period starting 10 days before weaning and lasting up to 14 days post-weaning piglets in the control group were supplied only control cheese the impact of such additives on the release of lactate dehydrogenase ldh spectroscopic and electrophoretic assay alteration of immunity index of metabolic activity jejunum histology light microscopy and health of conventional piglets from a problematic breed monitoring of hematology consistency and moisture of feces and body temperature were examined we found significant decrease in ldh leakage in the blood serum and tissue extracts indicating better cell membrane integrity in the individual organs of animals probiotics and flaxseed applied together seem to be a good source of nutrients to improve the immune status and the integrity of jejunum mucosa during infection
human coronaviruses hcovs are important pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract infections and have neuroinvasive abilities however little is known about the dynamic infection process of covs in vivo and there are currently no specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat hcov infection here we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter hcov-oc43 strain expressing renilla luciferase rluc roc43-ns2delrluc in mice with different genetic backgrounds c57bl/6 and balb/c additionally we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of hcov-oc43 through the central nervous system cns of live balb/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with roc43-ns2delrluc we found that roc43-ns2delrluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation and that viral titers and rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with roc43-ns2delrluc moreover viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of balb/c mice consistent with its tropism in the cns furthermore the rluc readout correlated with the hcov replication ability and protein expression which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice additionally we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited roc43-ns2delrluc replication in vivo these results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of hcov-oc43 in the cns and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive hcovs in live mice

we report here on antigens from the sars-cov-2 virus spike protein that when presented by class i mhc can lead to cytotoxic cd8 + t cell anti-viral responses in covid-19 patients we present a method in which the sars-cov-2 spike protein is converted into a library of peptide antigen-major histocompatibility complexes pmhcs as single chain trimers that contain the peptide antigen the mhc hla allele subunit and the β-2 microglobulin subunit this library is used to detect the evolution of virus-specific t cell populations in four covid-19 study participants two of which share one hla allele and the other two a second hla allele at two time points over the initial course of infection hla-matched participants exhibit similar virusspecific t cell populations but very different time-trajectories of those populations this strategy can be used to track those virus-specific t cell populations over the course of an infection thus providing deep insight into the sars-cov-2 immune system trajectories observed in different covid-19 patients
the effects of incorporating diethylaminoethyl-dextran deae-d in the inoculum with bovine respiratory syaeytial virus brsv on the infectivity of brsv was evaluated a concentration of 40 ~zg deae-d/ml provided maximal enhancement of infection as determined by the time of onset of cytopachic effect cpe the percentage of cells infected by the inocutum and the amount of virus produced when deae-d was used in the inoculum the cpe appeared a day earlier the percentage of cells infected by the inocnlum as determined by the fluorescent antibody test was increased 11 times and the viral titer was increased 2 times as compared to results obtained without deae-d bovine respiratory syncy~ial virus-infected cultures contained much cell-associated virus which could be liberated by sonication to increase the titer of virus stocks the use of brsvinfected cells rather than supernates from brsv-infected cells increased the rate at which a cytopathic effect developed although it did not substantially increase the titer of virus which was harvested the use of deae-d in the inoculum and the passage of brsv-infected cells instead of virm suspensions was found to be the quickest and most effective method of consistently obtaining brsv with a titer of about 105.5 tcids0/ml 15 arch virol 56/3
this study compares some etiological factors involved in the naturally occurrence of lamb scours in 18 merino sheep farms randomly selected in the area of "la serena" southwest spain a lack of influence of some variables flock size type of facilities type of breeding lambing percentage isolation of campylobacter jejuni rotavirus spp coronavirus spp and salmonella spp on lamb mortality rate was detected the opposite was true for cleaning of the lambing areas organization of lambing periods accumulation of lambs in the pens high content of fat protein and lactose in milk and low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes cryptosporidium spp and escherichia coli isolation showed a trend to be linked to the presence of diarrhoea a positive correlation was found between serum total protein in ewes and serum gamma globulin in lambs thus the measure of serum total protein in ewes before lambing would be a valuable indicator of the risk of lamb scouring and it would be useful to establish an adequate programme to prevent this condition in the farms of this geographical area
griffithsin grft is a red alga-derived lectin with demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against enveloped viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov japanese encephalitis virus jev hepatitis c virus hcv and herpes simplex virus-2 hsv-2 however its pharmacokinetic profile remains largely undefined here sprague dawley rats were administered a single dose of grft at 10 or 20 mg/kg by intravenous oral and subcutaneous routes respectively and serum grft levels were measured at select time points in addition the potential for systemic accumulation after oral dosing was assessed in rats after 10 daily treatments with grft 20 or 40 mg/kg we found that parenterally-administered grft in rats displayed a complex elimination profile which varied according to administration routes however grft was not orally bioavailable even after chronic treatment nonetheless active grft capable of neutralizing hiv-env pseudoviruses was detected in rat fecal extracts after chronic oral dosing these findings support further evaluation of grft for pre-exposure prophylaxis against emerging epidemics for which specific therapeutics are not available including systemic and enteric infections caused by susceptible enveloped viruses in addition grft should be considered for antiviral therapy and the prevention of rectal transmission of hiv-1 and other susceptible viruses
picobirnaviruses pbvs are mostly found in animal alimentary samples in this study among 576 respiratory specimens from 476 mammals and 100 chickens genogroup i pbvs were detected in three cattle and three monkeys and a genogroup ii pbv-positive sample was collected from one cattle specimen more than one pbv sequence type was observed in two and one genogroup i pbv-positive samples from cattle and monkeys respectively twenty-four complete/near-complete segments 2 nine from respiratory and 15 from alimentary samples from the cattle and monkey genogroup i pbvs and one complete segment 2 from the cattle genogroup ii pbv were sequenced similar to other studies the cattle pbvs also showed a high diversity in contrast the monkey pbvs observed in this study were clustered into three distinct clades within each clade all the sequences showed >99% amino acid identities this unique phenomenon is probably due to the fact that monkeys in our locality reside in separated troops with minimal inter-troop contact whereas segment 2 contains the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene . by conducting sequence and phylogenetic analyses of rdrp genes pbvs were classified into genogroups i and ii . recently it was reported that a third genogroup of pbv genogroup iii was obtained from invertebrate hosts and differs largely from the pbvs of genogroups i and ii . in our recent study in which serial samples from the same animal were collected we observed that pbv probably evolves through mechanisms similar to other segmented rna viruses such as rotaviruses double-stranded rna virus . rotaviruses evolve through reassortment of their genomes resulting in enormous diversity . this also contributes to the emergence of new rotavirus strains resulting in disease outbreaks . however in a recent study on pbv detected in a marmot of the qinghai-tibet plateau it was found that segmentation-associated motifs were identified in both bi-segmented and unsegmented pbvs unsegmented pbvs may undergo genome segmentation at the motif region and convert to segmented pbvs which represents a unique segmentation mechanism .traditionally pbvs were found in alimentary samples of animals however in two recent studies pbvs were amplified from >10% and 0.97% of respiratory samples collected from pigs and a human respectively . such discoveries have improved our understandings on the tissue tropism of pbvs in the corresponding hosts we hypothesize that pbvs may also reside in the respiratory tracts of animals other than pigs and humans to test this hypothesis we carried out a molecular epidemiology study of pbvs in respiratory samples collected from mammals and poultry genome segment 2 sequencing comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of the pbvs detected in the respiratory and alimentary samples of cattle and monkeys were also performed
tuberculosis causes serious health problem for the world population antigenic peptides selected by pathogen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are presented by major histocompatibility complex mhc or human leukocyte antigen in humans molecules and hla-a restricted responses may be of interest for vaccine development and the understanding of cellular immunity a series of peptides derived from the 10-kda culture filtrate protein cfp10 and the 6 kda early secretory antigenic target esat-6 in the mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb have been screened and a ctl epitope restricted by the human leukocyte antigen hla-a24 a common hla allele in asian people has been identified in this study we studied a panel of cfp10 and esat-6-derived peptides to identify those with binding motifs for hla-a24 molecules the antigenicity of candidate peptides was assessed with in vitro refolding tests and an enzyme-linked immunospot elispot assay and by tetramer staining to determine the capacity to stimulate ctls from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of hla-a24-positive tb patients we report that one novel candidate peptide at positions 5e14 of esat-6 of mtb could induce peptide-specific ctls from pbmcs of hla-a24-positive patients but not from hla-a24-negative patients and hla-a24-positive healthy controls identified epitope is a weak binder for hla-a24 molecule in a mini mhc refolding assay since the peptide is presented by a common hla class i molecule it may be useful for immunotherapy against mtb infection and vaccine development in the large population of mtb-infected patients
feline coronavirus fcov is common among cats living indoors in groups in about 10% of infected cats a potentially lethal disease feline infectious peritonitis fip occurs virus transmission is faecal-oral mutian® xraphconn mutian x is a product marketed to treat cats with fip but is also being used to stop virus shedding although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose the aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats in five multicat households 29 cats naturally infected with fcov and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given mutian x pills virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity mutian x given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding a dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats posttreatment using a sensitive rt-qpcr test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after mutian x than recovered from infection during the control period p < .00001 this is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal fcov shedding in chronically infected cats
historically live attenuated replicating vaccines rather than inactivated preparations have provided the most effective protection against viral infection and disease a partial list of such vaccines includes measles mumps rubella polio vaccinia and yellow fever . notably these vaccines elicit essentially life-long protective immunity in contrast immunity induced by inactivated or subunit vaccines is generally of more limited duration a key factor in pursuit of the latter approaches is safety concerns arise not only over the possibility of disease induction in vaccinated individuals particularly those who are immune compromised but also over spread of the vaccine virus in the population these issues are perhaps most evident in the efforts to develop a vaccine against hiv where the target populations are likely to include some individuals already infected with hiv and perhaps immune suppressed as a result of their infection yet nowhere is the urgency of vaccine development greater than in the aids field in this chapter replicating and non-replicating viral vectors will be discussed with the focus largely on aids vaccine research where a spectrum of both types of vector each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages is under development review of several in each category will illustrate issues faced in vector selection viral vectors for which both replicating and non-replicating forms are available include adenoviruses and poxviruses vectors designed primarily as replication-defective include adeno-associated virus alphavirus and herpesvirus while replicating vectors include measles virus and vesicular stomatitis virus other vectors based on very successful vaccines have been less heavily exploited and will not be covered here for example poliovirus and yellow fever virus vaccines both replication-competent elicit life-long persistent immunity yet as vectors both exhibit not only genetic instability but also small insert capacity limiting interest for vaccine development features of various viral vectors and recent results following their use will first be reviewed followed by a consideration of issues faced in vector selection table 1 lists some of the properties of each of the vectors covered here adenoviruses ad are among the most heavily exploited vectors for vaccine development the virology and molecular biology of the double-stranded dna virus were heavily investigated for years as part of gene therapy applications providing an invaluable knowledge base for further development in the vaccine arena several ad features are particularly attractive for vaccine use including infection of both dividing and non-dividing cells high levels of publisher's disclaimer this is a pdf file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication as a service to our customers
at the population level the virus-host relationship is not set up to end with the complete elimination of either or both pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population in turn the virus can never completely eliminate the host population because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite a certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship against this backdrop viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart the answer seems clear the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population the dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively dramatically challenging host immunity and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population in this article we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which has caused covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virushost relationship in fact only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick recover and develop immunity while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover if the pandemic does not stop in a few decades it is anticipated that sars-cov-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population keywords sars-cov-2 · virus-host relationship system · pandemic publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
most pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface therefore mucosal vaccination especially through oral or intranasal administration routes is highly desired for infectious diseases meanwhile protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or dna based ones in vaccine development however the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting the relatively low immunogenicity as well as the low stability of the protein antigens require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations including the selection of immunostimulants the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions this review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization of vaccine delivery systems for intranasal and oral administrations keywords mucosal vaccine protein antigen adjuvant immunostimulant vaccine delivery system electronic supplementary material the online version of this article subunit protein antigens are much safer alternatives to the whole pathogen or viral vector-based antigens since they have lower risk of causing diseases but the immunogenicity protein-based mucosal vaccine review
lactogenic immunity transferred to piglets after inoculation of a live vaccine to pregnant sows was proved limited to control porcine epidemic diarrhea ped hence here we evaluated the efficacy of administration of a probiotic compound containing bacillus mesentericus clostridium butyricum and enterococcus faecalis together with a commercial live-attenuated ped vaccine nisseiken ped live vaccine nisseiken tokyo japan to improve the health and reproductive performance of ped-infected sows twenty pregnant sows in a ped-positive farm were equally divided into probiotics-administered vp and control vc sow groups a commercial live-attenuated vaccine was injected as per the manufacturer's instruction the probiotic compound 15 g/day was orally administered to vp from 6 weeks pre-parturition to 7 days post-parturition ppd7 vp had a significantly higher body weight at ppd7 than vc 191 vs 186 kg p < 0.05 at day 3 post-parturition ppd3 4.18 vs 3.63 kg/day and ppd7 5.14 vs 4.34 kg/day milk produced by vp was significantly p < 0.05 greater than that by vc total immunoglobulin iga and igg concentrations at day 0 were significantly p < 0.05 higher in whey of vp 1.9 and 6.6 g/dl respectively than in that of vc 1.7 and 6.1 g/dl respectively however total igg concentration in whey of vp and vc at ppd3 and ppd7 did not differ antibody titer was significantly higher at day 0 in serum of vp than it was that of vc 60 vs 37 in geometric mean p < 0.05 likewise the antibody titer in whey of vp and vc was found to be similar at day 0 416 vs 208 in geometric mean p = 0.13 consequently vp had fewer days between weaning and return to estrus than did vc 7 vs 10 days p < 0.05 moreover piglets of vp had a significantly p < 0.05 higher litter weight at birth 9252 g/litter and a lower mortality 12% during suckling than those of vc 8686 g/litter and 28% respectively in summary probiotic-supplemented pedvaccinated sows were healthier transferred ped-specific antibodies via colostrum to piglets had greater litter weight at birth and reduced mortality during suckling
red pandas are popular exhibit animals and their veterinary care has attracted a fair amount of study and attention while the information we have on the health of red pandas relies on observations of a relatively small captive population there have been regular reviews of the pathology of captive red pandas see chapter 16 additionally reports on the management of clinical diseases have slowly increased as with many captive animals red panda health problems can be categorized into two age-based groups paediatric and adult this chapter addresses the broad health concerns of those two groups followed by sections on parasites infectious diseases and vaccination and concludes with suggestions for chemical restraint and anaesthesia of red pandas
plant-derived biologicals for use in animal health are becoming an increasingly important target for research into alternative improved methods for disease control although there are no commercial products on the market yet the development and testing of oral plant-based vaccines is now beyond the proofof-principle stage vaccines such as those developed for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus have the potential to stimulate both mucosal and systemic as well as lactogenic immunity as has already been seen in target animal trials plants
in order to survey the infectious situation of canine coronavirus ccv in giant panda population a virus neutralization test detecting specific antibodies against ccv in giant panda's sera was established by using two-fold dilutions of serum and 100 tcidso of the virus the 62 sera samples of giant pandas which were gathered from zoos and reserve region of sichuan province china were detected the neutralization antibody titer of 14 was recognized as the positive criterion 8 sera samples were detected to be positive and the positive rate was 12.9%. the titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 18 to 132 it was the first comprehensive investigation on neutralization antibodies against ccv in giant panda population in china the results of study showed that the infection of ccv in giant panda population was universal which has posed a threat to the health of giant panda therefore it is incumbent on us to study safe and effective vaccines to protect giant panda against ccv infection

ongoing outbreaks of h5n1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl domestic poultry and humans in asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing protean pandemic threat we review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic h5n1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs the acquisition of novel traits including lethality to waterfowl ferrets felids and humans indicates an expanding host range the natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations cocirculating in ducks contributes to the spread of h5n1 in asia transmission of highly pathogenic h5n1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western china has increased the geographic spread the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines in fact the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines
kingdom hunovs have recently been isolated from pet dogs in europe m summa c.-h von bonsdorff and l maunula j clin virol 53244 -247 2012 http//dx doi org/10.1016/j jcv.2011.12.014 raising concerns about potential zoonotic infections with 31% of united kingdom households owning a dog this could prove to be an important transmission route to examine this risk canine tissues were studied for their ability to bind to hunov in vitro in addition canine stool samples were analyzed for the presence of viral nucleic acid and canine serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-hunov antibodies the results showed that seven different genotypes of hunov virus-like particles vlps can bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue suggesting that infection is at least theoretically possible although hunov rna was not identified in stool samples from 248 dogs serological evidence of previous exposure to hunov was obtained in 43/325 canine serum samples remarkably canine seroprevalence for different hunov genotypes mirrored the seroprevalence in the human population though entry and replication within cells have not been demonstrated the canine serological data indicate that dogs produce an immune response to hunov implying productive infection in conclusion this study reveals zoonotic implications for hunov and to elucidate the significance of this finding further epidemiological and molecular investigations will be essential
isotype-capture elisas for bcv-speci®c iga and igm were developed and tested on milk and serum samples from swedish cattle the capture elisas showed higher sensitivity than indirect elisas for detection of bcv-speci®c iga and igm in the capture elisas the agreement between detection in milk and serum samples was 94% for iga and 86% for igm the correlation between log 10 titres in milk and serum was r0.82 p<0.001 for iga and 0.84 p<0.001 for igm milk seemed a better target than serum for diagnosing speci®c iga at low levels there was no variation in the isotype-speci®c bcv antibody titres between healthy quarters of the same udder but subclinical mastitis was associated with higher levels of iga antibodies and weak false igm positive reactions in undiluted milk bovine iga and igm antibodies in milk and serum showed high stability towards freezing and thawing and storage at room temperature the antibody responses to bcv were followed in milk and serum from six dairy cows and in serum from four calves for a period of 1 year after an outbreak of winter dysentery wd in this outbreak some animals became reinfected with bcv the iga and igm capture elisas differentiated between primarily bcv infected and reinfected animals in the primarily infected cattle igm antibodies were ®rst detected in milk and serum four to nine days after the ®rst wd veterinary microbiology 72 2000 183±206 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 9 9 0 0 2 0 8 -4 symptoms observed and were subsequently detected for at least 2±3 weeks igm was also detected in the reinfected cows but mostly at lower levels and for a shorter period of time than in the primarily infected animals in milk however the igm response of the reinfected cows was detected for a longer period of time than in serum six months after the outbreak iga was still detected in both serum and milk of all six cows and also in serum of one calf the reinfected cows showed higher and more long-lasting peak levels of iga in milk and serum than the primarily infected cows indicating boosting of the iga response #
human heart disease is a major cause of death and disability a variety of animal models of cardiac disease have been developed to better understand the etiology cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction and novel therapeutic strategies the animal models have included large animals e g pig and dog and small rodents e g mouse and rat and the advantages of genetic manipulation in mice have appropriately encouraged the development of novel mouse models of cardiac disease however there are major differences between rodent and human hearts that raise cautions about the extrapolation of results from mouse to human the rabbit is a medium-sized animal that has many cellular and molecular characteristics very much like human and is a practical alternative to larger mammals numerous rabbit models of cardiac disease are discussed including pressure or volume overload ischemia rapid-pacing doxorubicin drug-induced arrhythmias transgenesis and infection these models also lead to the assessment of therapeutic strategies which may become beneficial in human cardiac disease section editors

in this study we describe the detection of novel paramyxoviruses from the eidolon helvum species of fruit bats we extracted rna from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in zambia over a period of 4 years 2008200920102011 semi-nested rt-pcr detected a total of 25 8% positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis among the positive samples seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected five viruses were closely related to the genus henipavirus while two viruses were related to the unclassified bat paramyxoviruses from ghana and congo brazzaville our study identified novel henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using rt-pcr in fruit bats from kansaka national park and indicated the presence of similar bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses the presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk
one of the most important anthropic missions is preventing the global spread of infectious diseases vaccination is the only available preventive treatment for infectious diseases but the availability of vaccines in developing countries is not adequate we report a simple easy-to-use noninvasive hydrogel patch transcutaneous vaccination system antigen ag-specific igg production was induced by applying an agimmersed patch to non-pretreated mouse auricle or hairless rat back skin immunofluorescence histochemical analysis revealed that langerhans cells resident in the epidermal layer captured the antigenic proteins delivered by the hydrogel patch which promoted the penetration of antigenic proteins through the stratum corneum and that ag-capturing langerhans cells migrated into draining lymph nodes humoral immunity elicited by our transcutaneous vaccination system demonstrated neutralizing activity in both adenoviral infection and passive-challenge tetanus toxin experiments the use of this hydrogel patch transcutaneous vaccination system will facilitate the global distribution of effective and convenient vaccines
eight hundred and thirteen european rodents and shrews encompassing seven different species were screened for alphacoronaviruses using pcr detection novel alphacoronaviruses were detected in the species rattus norvegicus microtus agrestis sorex araneus and myodes glareolus these together with the recently described lucheng virus found in china form a distinct rodent/shrew-specific clade within the coronavirus phylogeny across a highly conserved region of the viral polymerase gene the new members of this clade were up to 22% dissimilar at the nucleotide level to the previously described lucheng virus as such they might represent distinct species of alphacoronaviruses these data greatly extend our knowledge of wildlife reservoirs of alphacoronaviruses
a novel coronavirus the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the causative agent of sars the profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the virus is critical to the development of vaccine and diagnostic tools in this study 13 recombinant proteins associated with four structural proteins s e m and n and five putative uncharacterized proteins 3a 3b 6 7a and 9b of the sars-cov were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific igg antibodies in sars patient sera by protein microarray antibodies to proteins s 3a n and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase sars patients whereas those to proteins e m 3b 6 and 7a were undetected in the detectable specific antibodies anti-s and anti-n were dominant and could persist in the sera of sars patients until week 30 among the rabbit antisera to recombinant proteins s3 n 3a and 9b only anti-s3 serum showed significant neutralizing activity to the sars-cov infection in vero e6 cells the results suggest 1 that anti-s and anti-n antibodies are diagnostic markers and in particular that s3 is immunogenic and therefore is a good candidate as a subunit vaccine antigen and 2 that from a virus structure viewpoint the presence in some human sera of antibodies reacting with two recombinant polypeptides 3a and 9b supports the hypothesis that they are synthesized during the virus cycle
different types of vaccines against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr are commercially available among these inactivated glycoprotein e ge-deleted marker vaccines are commonly used but their ability to induce passive immunity is poorly known here we evaluated the passive immunity transferred from dams immunised with commercial inactivated ge-deleted marker vaccines to calves we vaccinated 12 pregnant cattle devoid of neutralising antibodies against bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 bohv-1 and divided them into two groups with 6 animals each both groups were injected with a different inactivated ge-deleted marker vaccine administrated via intranasal or intramuscular routes an additional 6 pregnant cattle served as the unvaccinated control group after calving the number of animals in each group was increased by the newborn calves in the dams the humoral immune response was evaluated before calving and subsequently at different times until post-calving day 180 pcd180 in addition the antibodies in colostrum milk and in serum samples from newborn calves were evaluated at different times until pcd180 the results indicated that inactivated glycoprotein e ge-deleted marker vaccines are safe and produce a good humoral immune response in pregnant cattle until calving and pcd180 moreover results showed that in calf serum passive immunity persists until pcd180
the context and purpose of the study included 1 bacterial expression of viral protein 6 vp6 of porcine rotavirus prv and generation of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the vp6 protein 3 establishment of a discrimination elisa to distinguish prv from a panel of other porcine viruses results the vp6 gene of prv isolate dn30209 amplified by reverse transcription-pcr was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame orf encoding 397 amino acids sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that prv dn30209 may belong to group a of rotavirus bacterially expressed vp6 was expressed in e coli and anti-vp6 antibody was capable of distinguishing prv from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus porcine circovirus type ii porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus porcine pseudorabies virus and porcine parvovirus conclusions prv vp6 expressed in e coli can be used to generate antibodies in rabbit anti-vp6 serum antibody can be used as good diagnostic reagents for detection of prv
as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus sftsv and heartland virus hrtv both of which have caused severe disease with fatal casualties in humans in this study we present the whole genome of a novel banyangvirus named zwiesel bat banyangvirus revealed through deep sequencing of the eptesicus nilssonii bat virome the detection of the novel bat banyangvirus which is in close phylogenetic relationship with the pathogenic hrtv and bhav underlines the possible impact of emerging phenuiviruses on public health the banyangvirus genus currently classified as part of the phenuviridae family in the order bunyavirales is characterized by a tri-segmented negative-or ambisense ssrna genome of 11-19 kb length in total four structural proteins are encoded on the genome the l protein rna-dependent rna polymerase on segment l two glycoproteins gn and gc on segment m the nucleocapsid protein on segment n and the nonstructural protein nss on segment s banyangviruses can infect vertebrates and invertebrates and have caused febrile infections encephalitis and severe fevers with fatal outcome in humans therefore being increasingly reported as emerging pathogens of public health importance 1-3 . recently two novel tick-borne phenuiviruses huaiyangshan banyangvirus and heartland virus were detected and characterized they form together with guertu banyangvirus a new genus within the phenuiviridae genus the banyangviruses clade 12 . bhav was initially reported in 2011 in the henan and hubei provinces china patients showed fever or hemorrhagic fever thrombocytopenia leukocytopenia and multi-organ dysfunction with an initial case fatality rate of 30% 14 . by then the etiological virus was isolated from patients' blood and haemaphysalis longicornis and rhipicephalus microplus ticks throughout china south korea and japan 56 . similar symptoms were recognized in two men from missouri usa the respective virus named heartland virus hrtv was isolated in 2012 from patients' blood and amblyomma americanum ticks collected in the field 27 . a third novel banyangvirus with close relation to bhav and hrtv was detected in tasmania state australia the virus named hunter island group virus higv was isolated from ixodes eudyptidis ticks which were blood-feeding on a shy albatross thalassarche cauta colony with signs of unknown disease outbreak 8 . despite the identification of ticks as vectors for bhav hrtv and higv the amplifying or reservoir hosts of the viral pathogens remain unknown bats are the primary reservoir host for several zoonotic viruses with a high impact on public health including numerous filoviruses paramyxoviruses coronaviruses and bunyaviruses 9 . so far two members of the family phenuiviridae are associated with bats the highly pathogenic rift valley fever virus was detected in micropteropus
by definition zoonotic pathogens are not strict host-species specialists in that they infect humans and at least one nonhuman reservoir species the majority of zoonotic pathogens infect and are amplified by multiple vertebrate species in nature each of which has a quantitatively different impact on the distribution and abundance of the pathogen and thus on disease risk unfortunately when new zoonotic pathogens emerge the dominant response by public health scientists is to search for a few or even the single most important reservoirs and to ignore other species that might strongly influence transmission this focus on the single "primary" reservoir host species can delay biological understanding and potentially public health interventions as species important in either amplifying or regulating the pathogen are overlooked investigating the evolutionary and ecological strategy of newly discovered or emerging pathogens within the community of potential and actual host species will be fruitful to both biological understanding and public health
recombinant subvirual particles retain similar antigenic features of their authentic viral capsids and thus have been applied as nonreplicating subunit vaccines against viral infection and illness additionally the self-assembled polyvalent subviral particles are excellent platforms to display foreign antigens for immune enhancement for vaccine development these subviral particle-based vaccines are noninfectious and thus safer than the conventional live attenuated and inactivated vaccines while several vlp vaccines are available in the markets numerous others including dual vaccines against more than one pathogen are under clinical or preclinical development this article provides an update of these efforts
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is the major causative agent of fatal diarrhea in piglets to study the pathogenic features of pedv using a mouse model pedv with virulence in mice is required in pursuit of this we adapted a tissue-culture-passed pedv mk strain to suckling mouse brains pedv obtained after ten passages through the brains mk-p10 had increased virulence for mice and its fusion activity in cultured cells exceeded that of the original strain however the replication kinetics of mk and mk-p10 did not differ from each other in the brain and in cultured cells the spike s protein of mk-p10 had four amino acid substitutions relative to the original strain one of these an h-to-r substitution at residue 1381 was first detected in pedv isolated after eight passages and both this virus mk-p8 and mk-p10 showed enhanced syncytium formation relative to the original mk strain and viruses isolated after two four and six passages suggesting the possibility that the h-to-r mutation was responsible for this activity this mutation could be also involved in the increased virulence of pedv observed for mk-p10
the aim of this study was to investigate clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens in 82 diarrheic dogs positive for canine parvovirus type 2 cpv enterotoxigenic c perfringens type a was isolated from three 3.6% dogs one 1.2% strain was also positive for nete-and netf-encoding genes which are commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs toxigenic c difficile was isolated from one animal 1.2% which was also positive for a/b toxins the present study identified c difficile and c perfringens infection in cpv-positive dogs further studies are necessary to clarify if clostridial infections may predispose or potentiate cpv-infection in dogs or vice versa
astroviruses astvs are responsible for infection of a large diversity of mammalian and avian species including bats aquatic birds livestock and humans we investigated astvs circulation in bats in mozambique and mayotte a small island in the comoros archipelago located between east africa and madagascar biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the astv rna-dependent rna-polymerase gene with a pan-astv semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay none of the 79 samples obtained from mayotte bats pteropus seychellensis comorensis and chaerephon pusillus tested positive however 20.1% of bats sampled in mozambique shed astvs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected many astvs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association but also with astvs previously reported from malagasy bats our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of astvs in bats in the western indian ocean islands including the southeastern african coast and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations
background in sweden knowledge about the role of enteropathogenic escherichia coli in neonatal calf diarrhea and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in e coli from young calves is largely unknown this has therapeutic concern and such knowledge is also required for prudent use of antimicrobials methods in a case control study esherichia coli isolated from faecal samples from dairy calves were phenotyped by biochemical fingerprinting and analyzed for virulence genes by pcr antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration mic farm management data were collected and fisher's exact test and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed of 95 e coli tested for antimicrobial susceptibility 61% were resistant to one or more substances and 28% were multi-resistant the virulence gene f5 k99 was not found in any isolate in total 21 out of 40 of the investigated virulence genes were not detected or rarely detected the virulence genes espp irp and fyua were more common in resistant e coli than in fully susceptible isolates p < 0.05 the virulence gene terz was associated with calf diarrhea p ≤ 0.01 the participating 85 herds had a median herd size of 80 lactating cows herds with calf diarrhea problems were larger > 55 cows p < 0.001 had higher calf mortality p ≤ 0.01 and calf group feeders were more in use p > 0.05 compared to herds without calf diarrhea problems there was no association between calf diarrhea and diversity of enteric e coli conclusions antimicrobial resistance was common in e coli from pre-weaned dairy calves occurring particularly in calves from herds experiencing calf diarrhea problems the results indicate that more factors than use of antimicrobials influence the epidemiology of resistant e coli enteropathogenic e coli seems to be an uncommon cause of neonatal calf diarrhea in swedish dairy herds in practice calf diarrhea should be regarded holistically in a context of infectious agents calf immunity management practices etc we therefore advice against routine antimicrobial treatment and recommend that bacteriological cultures followed by testing for antimicrobial susceptibility and for virulence factors are used to guide decisions on such treatment
background convalescent serum and blood were used to treat patients during outbreaks of zaire ebolavirus zebov infection in 1976 and 1995 with inconclusive results during the recent 2013-2016 west african epidemic serum/plasma from survivors of zebov infection was used to treat patients in the affected countries and several repatriated patients the effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown methods nine rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with zebov-makona beginning on day 3 after exposure at the onset of viremia 4 animals were treated with homologous zebov-makona convalescent macaque sera 3 animals were treated in parallel with heterologous sudan ebolavirus sebov convalescent macaque sera and 2 animals served as positive controls and were not treated surviving animals received additional treatments on days 6 and 9 results both untreated control animals died on postinfection day 9 all 4 zebov-makona-infected macaques treated with homologous zebov-makona convalescent sera died on days 8-9 one macaque treated with heterologous sebov convalescent sera survived while the other animals treated with the heterologous sebov sera died on days 7 and 9 conclusions the findings suggest that convalescent sera alone is not sufficient for providing 100% protection against lethal zebov infection when administered at the onset of viremia
the sars-cov spike glycoprotein s is the main target of the protective immune response in humans and animal models of sars here we demonstrated that efficient expression of s from the wild-type spike gene in cultured cells required the use of improved plasmid vectors containing donor and acceptor splice sites as well as heterologous viral rna export elements such as the cte of mazon-pfizer monkey virus or the pre of woodchuck hepatitis virus wpre the presence of both splice sites and wpre markedly improved the immunogenicity of s-based dna vaccines against sars upon immunization of mice with low doses 2 μg of naked dna only intron and wpre-containing vectors could induce neutralizing anti-s antibodies and provide protection against challenge with sars-cov our observations are likely to be useful for the construction of plasmid and viral vectors designed for optimal expression of intronless genes derived from cytoplasmic rna viruses
alphaviruses members of the positive-sense single-stranded rna virus family togaviridae represent a re-emerging public health concern worldwide as mosquito vectors expand into new geographic ranges members of the alphavirus genus tend to induce clinical disease characterized by rash arthralgia and arthritis chikungunya virus ross river virus and semliki forest virus or encephalomyelitis eastern equine encephalitis virus western equine encephalitis virus and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus though some patients who recover from the initial acute illness may develop long-term sequelae regardless of the specific infecting virus studies examining the natural disease course in humans and experimental infection in cell culture and animal models reveal that host genetics play a major role in influencing susceptibility to infection and severity of clinical disease genome-wide genetic screens including loss of function screens microarrays rna-sequencing and candidate gene studies have further elucidated the role host genetics play in the response to virus infection with the immune response being found in particular to majorly influence the outcome this review describes the current knowledge of the mechanisms by which host genetic factors influence alphavirus pathogenesis and discusses emerging technologies that are poised to increase our understanding of the complex interplay between viral and host genetics on disease susceptibility and clinical outcome
background bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses covs of which some can lead to severe infection in human african bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens e g ebola and marburg viruses that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks a recent study in south africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to mers-cov from an insectivorous bat though madagascar is home to 44 bat species 41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous of which 34 are endemic no data exists concerning the circulation of covs in the island's chiropteran fauna certain malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat the purpose of our study is to detect and identify covs from frugivorous bats in madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats methods frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of madagascar we analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens results from 351 frugivorous bats we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species of which 13 viruses were identified from pteropus rufus and one from eidolon dupreanum giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the malagasy strains belong to the genus betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages conclusions our findings suggest that covs circulate in frugivorous bats of madagascar demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on madagascar are discussed
filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans the archetypal virus of this group ebola virus is responsible for the current filovirus epidemic in west africa filoviruses infect most mammalian cells resulting in broad species tropism and likely contributing to rapid spread of virus throughout the body a thorough understanding of filovirus entry events will facilitate the development of therapeutics against these critical steps in the viral life cycle this review summarizes the current understanding of filovirus entry and discusses some of the recent advancements in therapeutic strategies that target entry
zoonoses are diseases transmitted from animals to humans posing a great threat to the health and life of people all over the world according to who estimations 600 million cases of diseases caused by contaminated food were noted in 2010 including almost 350 million caused by pathogenic bacteria campylobacter salmonella as well as yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes may dwell in livestock poultry cattle and swine but are also found in wild animals pets fish and rodents animals often being asymptomatic carriers of pathogens excrete them with faeces thus delivering them to the environment therefore pathogens may invade new individuals as well as reside on vegetables and fruits pathogenic bacteria also penetrate food production areas and may remain there in the form of a biofilm covering the surfaces of machines and equipment a common occurrence of microbes in food products as well as their improper or careless processing leads to common poisonings symptoms of foodborne infections may be mild sometimes flu-like but they also may be accompanied by severe complications some even fatal the aim of the paper is to summarize and provide information on campylobacteriosis salmonellosis yersiniosis and listeriosis and the aetiological factors of those diseases along with the general characteristics of pathogens virulence factors and reservoirs
a seroepidemiologic study was conducted in north china in 2003 to determine the neutralizing antibody titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars convalescent sera a total of 99 sars convalescent serum samples were collected from patients from the inner mongolia autonomous region hebei province and beijing 35-180 days after the onset of symptoms the anti-sars antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa neutralization assay and western blot eightyseven serum samples were confirmed to be positive for sars antibodies the neutralizing antibody titer of the 87 positive sera was analyzed quantitatively by neutralization assay the geometric mean titer gmt of the 87 convalescent sera was 161 the kolmogorov-smirnov test showed that the neutralizing antibody titers conform to normal distribution which suggests that the average anti-sars antibody level in this study was representative of the convalescent antibody level of the sars population this result could be useful for the development and quality control of sars vaccines
the devastating ebola virus ebov outbreak in west africa in 2013-2016 has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens to be better prepared for new epidemics the who has compiled a list of priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which r&d efforts are therefore paramount r&d blueprint https//www who int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/. to this end the detailed characterization of vaccine platforms is needed the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv has been established as a robust vaccine vector backbone for infectious diseases for well over a decade the recent clinical trials testing the vaccine candidate vsv-ebov against ebov disease now have added a substantial amount of clinical data and suggest vsv to be an ideal vaccine vector candidate for outbreak pathogens in this review we discuss insights gained from the clinical vsv-ebov vaccine trials as well as from animal studies investigating vaccine candidates for blueprint pathogens article history

emerging viruses represent a continuous threat to human health and to farmed animals as evidenced on multiple occasions by outbreaks of influenza henipavirus and sars knowledge about the diversity of viromes present in reservoir species can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens in this study we extend the knowledge of astrovirus diversity in pigs by reporting the genetic characterization of an unknown astrovirus lineage phylogenetic analyses provided evidence that this porcine astrovirus lineage is unique and does not appear to share a recent common ancestor with any known mamastrovirus the data reported in this study extend the number of porcine astrovirus lineages to a total of five all of which most likely represent distinct species of different origins
the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov triggered the discovery of a high diversity of coronaviruses in bats studies from europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in france but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity in the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western europe was extensively explored ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the miniopteridae vespertilionidae and rhinolophidae families and a sars-cov-related betacoronavirus in rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified the diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western europe is much higher than previously described and includes a sars-cov sister group this diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species that said the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location the observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in europe and asia emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group

historic and contemporary host ecology and evolutionary dynamics have profound impacts on viral diversity virulence and associated disease emergence bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several emerging viral pathogens and are unique among mammals in their vagility potential for long-distance dispersal and often very large colonial populations we investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species we test the hypothesis that host geographic range area distribution population genetic structure migratory behavior international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn threat status body mass and colony size are associated with known viral richness in bats we analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny we find evidence that sampling effort iucn status and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats and that these associations are independent of phylogeny this study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats
acute respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity in children both in developed and developing countries a wide range of respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza a and b viruses parainfluenza viruses pivs adenovirus rhinovirus hrv have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections lrti in children in the past decades however in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies newly discovered viruses have been identified including human metapneumovirus hmpv coronaviruses nl63 hcov-nl63 and hku1 hcov-hku1 human bocavirus hbov new enterovirus hev parechovirus hpev and rhinovirus hrv strains polyomaviruses wu wupyv and ki kipyv and the pandemic h1n1v influenza a virus these discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns in this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging this review will present an overview of newly recognized as well as the main emerging respiratory viruses and seek to focus on the their contribution to infection and co-infection in lrtis in childhood
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec strains are the main cause of diarrhea in pigs pig diarrhea especially post-weaning diarrhea remains one of the most important swine diseases etec bacterial fimbriae including k88 f18 987p k99 and f41 promote bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate etec colonization in pig small intestine etec enterotoxins including heat-labile toxin lt and heat-stable toxins type ia porcine-type sta and type ii stb stimulate fluid hyper-secretion leading to watery diarrhea blocking bacteria colonization and/or neutralizing enterotoxicity of etec toxins are considered effective prevention against etec diarrhea in this study we applied the mefa multiepitope fusion antigen strategy to create toxoid mefas that carried antigenic elements of etec toxins and examined for broad antitoxin immunogenicity in a murine model by embedding sta toxoid sta p12f ntfyccelccnfacagcy a stb epitope kkdlcehy and an epitope of stx2e a subunit qsyvssln into the a1 peptide of a monomeric lt toxoid lt r192g two toxoid mefas 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-sta p12f ' and 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-3xsta p12f ' which carried three copies of sta p12f were constructed mice intraperitoneally immunized with each toxoid mefa developed igg antibodies to all four toxins induced antibodies showed in vitro neutralizing activities against lt sta stb and stx2e toxins moreover suckling piglets born by a gilt immunized with 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-3xsta p12f ' were protected when challenged with etec strains whereas piglets born by a control gilt developed diarrhea results from this study showed that the toxoid mefa induced broadly antitoxin antibodies and suggested potential application of the toxoid mefa for developing a broad-spectrum vaccine against etec diarrhea in pigs

avian paramyxoviruses apmvs are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds throughout the world and are separated into nine serotypes apmv-1 to -9 only in the case of apmv-1 the infection of non-avian species has been investigated the apmvs presently are being considered as human vaccine vectors in this study we evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of all nine apmv serotypes in hamsters the hamsters were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for clinical disease pathology histopathology virus replication and seroconversion on the basis of one or more of these criteria each of the apmv serotypes was found to replicate in hamsters the apmvs produced mild or inapparent clinical signs in hamsters except for apmv-9 which produced moderate disease gross lesions were observed over the pulmonary surface of hamsters infected with apmv-2 & -3 which showed petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages respectively replication of all of the apmvs except apmv-5 was confirmed in the nasal turbinates and lungs indicating a tropism for the respiratory tract histologically the infection resulted in lung lesions consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity and nasal turbinates with blunting or loss of cilia of the epithelium lining the nasal septa the majority of apmv-infected hamsters exhibited transient histological lesions that self resolved by 14 days post infection dpi all of the hamsters infected with the apmvs produced serotype-specific hi or neutralizing antibodies confirming virus replication taken together these results demonstrate that all nine known apmv serotypes are capable of replicating in hamsters with minimal disease and pathology
neonatal diarrheal disease is responsible for significant economic losses to the livestock industries in canada and around the world microbes responsible are diverse and include escherichia coli salmonella rotavirus coronavirus and cryptosporidia while the use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in recent decades the increasing pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics in animals has caused the livestock industry to seek appropriate alternatives antimicrobial/host defense peptides are natural compounds present on skin and in secretions in plants and animals that are microbicidal for bacteria viruses and parasites and they stimulate the immune system to combat infectious diseases our objective is to establish orally-obtained host defense peptides hdps as an alternative to antibiotics to protect against neonatal diarrheal disease in calves we devised a method to allow the cow udder to act as a factory to produce hdps so that suckling calves will receive a continuous oral dose of hdps over several weeks to protect them against neonatal diarrhea we will use adenovirus to deliver a gene coding for several hdps in-frame into mammary epithelial cells the epithelial cells will secrete the hdp protein into milk to be consumed by the suckling calves and trypsin in the calf gut will release the hdps through cleavage thus the novelty of this research lies not only in the proposed alternative to antibiotics to protect neonates against disease but in the method by which we introduce the peptides to the suckling offspring
feline coronavirus fcov is an enveloped single-stranded rna virus of the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales fcov is an important pathogen of wild and domestic cats and can cause a mild or apparently symptomless enteric infection especially in kittens fcov is also associated with a lethal systemic disease known as feline infectious peritonitis fip although the precise cause of fip pathogenesis remains unclear some hypotheses have been suggested in this review we present results from different fcov studies and attempt to elucidate existing theories on the pathogenesis of fcov infection

bourgueil e hutet e cariolet r and vannier p 1992 experimental infection of pigs with the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv measure of viral excretion vet microbiol twelve pigs were experimentally infected with a porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv by the oronasal route viral excretion was measured daily by two means-deep nasal swabs and air samples obtained in a cyclone sampler clinical signs were very slight on infected pigs airborne virus could be recovered from day 1 to day 6 post-infection in the cyclone sampler as well as in petri dishes placed in the same loose-box viral titres obtained from nasal swabs were significantly correlated with those obtained from air samples different collection media were compared the most efficient media for the collection of infectious viral particles contained a protective agent such as foetal calf serum
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv pandemic is driving the re-emergence of tuberculosis tb as a global health threat both by increasing the susceptibility of hiv-infected people to infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb and increasing the rate of emergence of drug-resistant mtb there are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co-infected patients including expense pill burden toxicity and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously the anti-helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non-replicating m abscessus was also recently described here we extend these findings to further demonstrate that niclosamide inhibits mycobacterial growth in infected human macrophages and mediates potent bacteriostatic activity against the virulent mtb beijing strain importantly we provide the first evidence that niclosamide inhibits hiv replication in human macrophages and jurkat t cells through post-integration effects on pro-virus transcription the dual antiviral and anti-mycobacterial activity was further observed in an in vitro model of hiv and mtb co-infection using human primary monocyte-derived macrophages these results support further investigation of niclosamide and derivatives as anti-retroviral/antimycobacterial agents that may reduce clinical challenges associated with multi-drug regimens and drug resistance
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov with pandemic potential is a major worldwide threat to public health however vaccine development for this pathogen lags behind as immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown in this study an immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening strategy of vaccine targets was performed to thoroughly screen the vital and effective dominant immunogens against mers-cov conservancy and population coverage analysis of the epitopes were done by the immune epitope database the results showed that the nucleocapsid n protein of mers-cov might be a better protective immunogen with high conservancy and potential eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses compared with spike s protein further the b-cell helper t-cell and cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitopes were screened and mapped to the n protein a total of 15 linear and 10 conformal b-cell epitopes that may induce protective neutralizing antibodies were obtained additionally a total of 71 peptides with 9-mer core sequence were identified as helper t-cell epitopes and 34 peptides were identified as ctl epitopes based on the maximum hla binding alleles top 10 helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes that may elicit protective cellular immune responses against mers-cov were selected as mers vaccine candidates population coverage analysis showed that the putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes could cover the vast majority of the population in 15 geographic regions considered where vaccine would be employed the b-and t-cell stimulation potentials of the screened epitopes is to be further validated for their efficient use as vaccines against mers-cov collectively this study provides novel vaccine target candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against mers-cov and other emerging infectious diseases
most emerging pathogens can infect multiple species underscoring the importance of 33 understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that allow some hosts to harbor greater 34 infection prevalence and share pathogens with other species however our understanding of 35 pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses despite bacteria accounting for the greatest 36 proportion of zoonoses because bacterial pathogens in bats order chiroptera can have 37 conservation and human health consequences studies that examine the ecological and 38 evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially 39 needed we here studied hemotropic mycoplasma spp i e hemoplasmas across a species-rich 40 bat community in belize over two years across 469 bats spanning 33 species half of individuals 41 and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive infection prevalence was higher for males 42 and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes hemoplasmas displayed high genetic 43 diversity 21 novel genotypes and strong host specificity evolutionary patterns supported co-44 divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts 45
previous reports on the spread of bovine virus diarrhoea virus bvdv from animals primarily infected with the agent are contradictory in this study the possibility of transmission of bvdv from calves simultaneously subjected to acute bvdv and bovine coronavirus bcv infection was investigated ten calves were inoculated intranasally with bvdv type 1 each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups in each group there were four additional calves resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group virulent bcv was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf two calves susceptible to both bvdv and bcv were kept in a separate group as controls all ten calves actively inoculated with bvdv became infected as shown by seroconversions and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions however none of the other eight calves in the two groups four in each seroconverted to this agent in contrast it proved impossible to prevent the spread of bcv infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus following infection bcv was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and after three weeks in the study all had seroconverted to this virus all calves including the controls showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3±15 after the trial started fever 40 c depressed general condition diarrhoea and cough the study showed that bvdv primarily infected cattle even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen are inefficient transmitters of bvdv this finding supports the principle of the scandinavian bvdv control programmes that elimination of bvdv infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected pi animals i e that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of pi animals is highly unlikely
a major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza have been conducted in human subjects studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past therefore as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines and a major challenge is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans the emergence of highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza ai viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by ai viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research the development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible as the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known we rely on extrapolation of the lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans the features and contributions of commonly used animal models for influenza vaccine research are discussed the recent emergence of the pandemic 2009 h1n1 influenza virus underscores the unpredictable nature of influenza viruses and the importance of pandemic preparedness
background neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial condition commonly present on pig farms and leads to economic losses due to increased morbidity and mortality of piglets immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens the microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are rotavirus a coronavirus enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec clostridium perfringens type c cryptosporidium spp giardia spp cystoisospora suis and strongyloides ransomi however in recent years the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens the primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of e coli enterococcus spp c perfringens and c difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens furthermore an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated results the prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for e coli c perfringens and c difficile was similar in both groups of piglets however enterococcus spp was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets furthermore adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets these bacteria were identified as e coli and enterococcus spp and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes the results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-etec e coli and enterococcus spp can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea these bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets when detection of common well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful

the aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of bacterial mycoplasmal and viral pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of calves in all-in all-out calf-rearing units according to clinical status non-medicated calves with and without respiratory disease signs were selected of the 40 herds investigated to analyse the micro-organisms present in healthy and diseased calves tracheobronchial lavage tbl and paired serum samples were analysed for bacteria mycoplasmas respiratory syncytial virus rsv parainfluenza virus 3 piv3 bovine corona virus bcv and bovine adenovirus bav pasteurella multocida was the most common bacterial pathogen it was isolated from 34% of the tbl samples in 28 herds and was associated with clinical respiratory disease p < 0.05 when other pathogenic bacteria or mycoplasma were present in the sample mannheimia spp and histophilus somni were rarely found mycoplasma bovis was not detected at all ureaplasma diversum was associated with clinical respiratory disease p < 0.05 tbl samples from healthy or suspect calves were more often negative in bacterial culture than samples from diseased calves p < 0.05 no viral infections were detected in six herds while 16-21 herds had rsv bcv bav or piv3 in the herds that had calves seroconverted to bcv respiratory shedding of bcv was more frequently observed than faecal shedding this study showed that the microbial combinations behind brd were diverse between herds m bovis an emerging pathogen in many countries was not detected #
background the influenza pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide animal models are useful in the study of influenza virus pathogenesis because of various limitations in current laboratory animal models it is essential to develop new alternative animal models for influenza virus research aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to virus infection in human method we investigated the replicative efficiency of influenza h1n1 virus classic strain influenza a/pr/8/34 seasonal influenza isolate a/guangzhou/gird/02/09 and swine-origin human influenza virus a/guangzhou/gird/ 07/09 at day1246 and 9 p i using tcid 50 and qpcr assay in tree shrew model body temperature was monitored in the morning and evening for 3 days before infection and for 14 days seroconversion was detected by determining the neutralizing antibody titers against the challenge viruses in the pre-and exposure serum samples collected before infection and at 14 days p i respectively lungs and tracheas of tree shews were collected at day 14 post p i for histopathological analysis lectinhistochemistry analysis was conducted to identify the distribution of saα23 gal and saα26 gal receptors in the lung and trachea results the infected tree shrew displayed mild or moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms and pathological changes in respiratory tracts the human h1n1 influenza virus may replicate in the upper respiratory tract of tree shrews analysis of the receptors distribution in the respiratory tract of tree shrews by lectinhistochemistry showed that sialic acid saα26-gal receptors were widely distributed in the trachea and nasal mucosa whereas saα23-gal receptor was the main receptor in the lung tissue conclusions based on these findings tree shrew seemed to mimic well influenza virus infection in humans we propose that tree shrews could be a useful alternative mammalian model to study pathogenesis of influenza h1n1 virus
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv has a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability the purpose of this study was to determine if porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 infection increases genetic variability of prrsv during serial passages in pigs and to determine if there is a difference in the prrsv mutation rate between pigs concurrently infected with pcv2a or pcv2b after 8 consecutive passages of prrsv alone group 1 prrsv with pcv2a group 2 or pcv2b group 3 in pigs the sequences of prrsv structural genes for open reading frame orf 5 orf6 orf7 and the partial non-structural protein gene nsp 2 were determined the total number of identified amino acid mutations in orf5 orf6 orf7 and nsp2 sequences was 30 for prrsv infection only 63 for prrsv/pcv2a concurrent infection and 77 for prrsv/pcv2b concurrent infection when compared with the original vr2385 virus used to infect the passage 1 pigs compared to what occurred in pigs infected with prrsv only the mutation rates in orf5 and orf6 were significantly higher for concurrent prrsv/pcv2b infected pigs the prrsv/pcv2a pigs had a significantly higher mutation rate in orf7 the results from this study indicated that besides orf5 and nsp2 the prrsv structural genes orf6 and orf7 were shown to mutate at various degrees when the prrsv was passaged over time in vivo furthermore a significantly higher mutation rate of prrsv was observed when pigs were co-infected with pcv2 highlighting the importance of concurrent infections on prrsv evolution and control
korean red ginseng krg is a heat-processed ginseng developed by the repeated steaming and airdrying of fresh ginseng compared with fresh ginseng krg has been shown to possess greater pharmacological activities and stability because of changes that occur in its chemical constituents during the steaming process in addition to anticancer anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities krg and its purified components have also been shown to possess protective effects against microbial infections here we summarize the current knowledge on the properties of krg and its components on infections with human pathogenic viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus influenza virus human immunodeficiency virus human herpes virus hepatitis virus norovirus rotavirus enterovirus and coxsackievirus additionally the therapeutic potential of krg as an antiviral and vaccine adjuvant is discussed
the african swine fever virus asfv has severely influenced the swine industry of the world currently there is no effective vaccine or drugs against the asfv how to effectively control the virus is challenging in this study we have analyzed all the publicly available asfv genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of asfv genomes interestingly the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions indels instead of the point mutations further analyses showed that the indels may be attributed much to the homologous recombination as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the asfv genomes besides the homologous recombination also led to changes of gene content of asfvs finally repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of asfv genomes which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination this work highlighted the importance of homologous recombination in shaping the genetic diversity of the asfvs and could help understand the evolution of the virus
the calicivirus rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus rhdv is widely used in australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild european rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus populations however widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain capm v-351 to overcome this we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel rhdv strains as rhdv does not replicate in cell culture variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent rhdv field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18-24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody after seven passages two amino acid substitutions in the p2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population furthermore a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages these findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that rhdv evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes in this case partial immune escape
this work was conducted to investigate calf-level factors that influence the risk of neonatal diarrhea and shedding of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in calves on dairy farms in ontario with histories of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004 a questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study samples were examined for c parvum oocysts by microscopy and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli salmonella bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus the consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea in addition a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection using the gllamm function in stata 9.0 multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of c parvum shedding or diarrhea c parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected furthermore 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample significant predictors of the calflevel risk of c parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth and the birth of a calf in the summer as www elsevier com/locate/prevetmed preventive veterinary medicine 82 2007 12-28 opposed to winter calves shedding c parvum oocysts had 5.3 95% ci 4.4 6.4 times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model furthermore infected calves shedding more than 2.2 â 10 5 oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts or = 6.1 95% ci 4.8 7.8 the odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth #
one of the main public health concerns of emerging viruses is their potential introduction into and sustained circulation among populations of immunologically naïve susceptible hosts the induction of protective immunity through vaccination can be a powerful tool to prevent this concern by conferring protection to the population at risk conventional approaches to develop vaccines against emerging pathogens have significant limitations lack of experimental tools for several emerging viruses of concern poor immunogenicity safety issues or lack of crossprotection against antigenic variants the unpredictability of the emergence of future virus threats demands the capability to rapidly develop safe effective vaccines we describe some recent advances in new vaccine strategies that are being explored as alternatives to classical attenuated and inactivated vaccines and provide examples of potential novel vaccines for emerging viruses these approaches might be applied to the control of many other emerging pathogens
disease is increasingly recognized as a threat to the conservation of wildlife and in many cases the source of disease outbreaks in wild carnivores is the domestic dog for disease to spill over from a domestic to a wild population three conditions must be satisfied susceptibility of the wild species presence of the disease agent in the domestic population and contact between the two populations of interest we investigated the potential for disease spillover from the domestic dog population to the wild carnivore population in the isoso of bolivia an area of tropical dry forest contiguous with a national park using questionnaires and discussions with residents we gathered data on the demography of dogs in the isoso including adult and neonatal mortality litter size and hunting frequency we analyzed a large data set containing self-recorded information on hunting in various communities of the isoso to determine the extent of dog participation in hunting and the duration of hunting trips finally we took blood samples from dogs in the isoso for a serosurvey of common canine pathogens more than 95% of dogs had positive titers to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus there was also a high seroprevalence in dogs for other pathogens a high population turnover of dogs which may allow diseases to be maintained endemically and frequent opportunities for contact between domestic and wild carnivores based on our results and the susceptibility of wild species previously reported in the literature domestic dogs represent a disease risk for wildlife in the bolivian isoso resumen cada vez más las enfermedades son reconocidas como una amenaza a la conservación de vida sil-§current address 763 oportunidades de contacto entre carnívoros domésticos y silvestres con base en nuestros resultados y en la susceptibilidad de especies silvestres previamente reportada en la literatura los perros domésticos representan un riesgo de enfermedad para la vida silvestre en el isoso boliviano
major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules play an important role in the susceptibility and/or resistance to many diseases to gain an insight into the mhc background and to facilitate the experimental use of cynomolgus macaques the second exon of the mhcmafa-dob -dpb1 and -dqb1 genes from 143 cynomolgus macaques were characterized by cloning to sequencing a total of 16 mafa-dob 16 mafa-dpb1 and 34 mafa-dqb1 alleles were identified which revealed limited moderate and marked allelic polymorphism at dob dpb1 and dqb1 respectively in a cohort of cynomolgus macaques of vietnamese origin in addition 16 mafa-dob 5 mafa-dpb1 and 8 mafa-dqb1 alleles represented novel sequences that had not been reported in earlier studies almost of the sequences detected at the dob and dqb1 locus in the present study belonged to dob*01 100% and dqb1*06 62% lineages respectively interestingly four three and one high-frequency alleles were detected at mafa-dob -dpb1 and -dqb1 respectively in this monkeys the alleles with the highest frequency among these monkeys were mafa-dob*010102 mafa-dpb1*13 and mafa-dqb1*0616 and these were found in 33 25.6% of 129 monkeys 32 31.37% of 102 monkeys and 30 31% of 143 monkeys respectively the high-frequency alleles may represent high priority targets for additional characterization of immune function we also carried out evolutionary and population analyses using these sequences to reveal population-specific alleles this information will not only promote the understanding of mhc diversity and polymorphism in the cynomolgus macaque but will also increase the value of this species as a model for biomedical research
a survey of infectious and parasitic diseases of stray cats was carried out using biological samples collected from animals captured during a catch-neuter-release programme in four counties of the lisbon metropolitan area the main objective was to investigate the potential threat of stray cats for animal and public health samples of blood stool hair and auricular swabs were collected from 231 cats in 27 colonies anti-toxoplasma gondii antibodies were detected in 47/194 samples 24.2% anti-leishmania infantum antibodies in 1/180 cats 0.6% intestinal parasites in 23/74 samples toxocara cati isospora felis ancylostoma tubaeforme dipylidium caninum uncinaria stenocephala toxascaris leonina and otodectes cynotis in 4/182 cats 2.2% dermatophyte fungi were isolated in 40/136 samples 29.4% feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies were detected in 23/226 samples 10.2% feline leukaemia virus antigen in 14/198 samples 7.1% and feline coronavirus rna in 9/127 samples 7.1%. our results revealed that zoonotic agents namely dermatophyte fungi and toxocara cati were present in stray cat colonies in the investigated counties overall the low frequency of major pathogens suggests a balanced relationship between host and agents

rift valley fever virus rvfv is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus that was first discovered in kenya in 1930 and has since spread to become endemic in much of africa and the arabian peninsula rift valley fever rvf causes recurrent outbreaks of febrile illness associated with high levels of mortality and poor outcomes during pregnancy-including foetal malformations spontaneous abortion and stillbirths-in livestock and associated with miscarriage in humans no vaccines are available for human use and those licensed for veterinary use have potential drawbacks including residual virulence that may contraindicate their use in pregnancy to address this gap we previously developed a simian adenovirus vectored vaccine chadox1 rvf that encodes rvfv envelope glycoproteins chadox1 rvf is fully protective against rvf in non-pregnant livestock and is also under development for human use here we now demonstrate that when administered to pregnant sheep and goats chadox1 rvf is safe elicits high titre rvfv neutralizing antibody and provides protection against viraemia and foetal loss although this protection is not as robust for the goats in addition we provide a description of rvfv challenge in pregnant goats and contrast this to the pathology observed in pregnant sheep together our data further support the ongoing development of chadox1 rvf vaccine for use in livestock and humans npj vaccines 2019 444 https//doi
porcine respiratory disease complex prdc a common piglet disease causes substantive economic losses in pig farming to investigate the viral diversity associated with prdc the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 prdc-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics by deep sequencing and de novo assembly 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries 16 viruses from serum nine from nasal swabs porcine circovirus pcv-2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and pseudorabies virus all commonly associated with prdc were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics but most viruses comprised small linear and circular dnas e g parvoviruses bocaviruses and circoviruses pcr was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 prdc-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls the average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the prdc-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls single or co-infections with pcv-2 or prrsv had very high detection rates in the prdcaffected piglets interestingly porcine parvovirus ppv-2 ppv-3 ppv-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with prdc these results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the prdc-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it
human rhinoviruses hrv represent the single most important etiological agents of the common cold and are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory infections in humans currently the performance of available animal models for immunization studies using hrv challenge is very limited the cotton rat sigmodon hispidus is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections in this work we show that without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus intranasal infection of cotton rats with hrv16 resulted in measurable isolation of infective virus lower respiratory tract pathology mucus production and expression of interferon-activated genes intramuscular immunization with live hrv16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies in addition cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-hrv16 serum were protected against hrv16 intranasal challenge finally protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of infectious virus loads in the lung following intranasal challenge overall our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is an economically important pathogenic virus in the swine production current vaccines against prrsv do not induce sterile immunity and the virus evolves at a rapid rate with frequent appearances of new strains in this study we screened a library of 502 highly purified natural product compounds to identify specific inhibitors of prrsv replication cycle our observations showed that many of the inhibitory compounds identified have activity on the cellular ion transport mechanisms we identified for the first time four compounds which inhibit the prrsv replication cycle at micro molar concentration or less namely 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate ouabain bufalin and valinomycin further we have identified 15 other compounds which can inhibit the prrsv replication at the concentration of 8 lm this study provides a basis for further development of pharmacological agents to inhibit prrsv replication
background oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of clostridium difficile infection cdi however application of previously developed vaccines for preventing cdi has been limited due to various reasons here we developed a recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a c difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for cdi prevention methods recombinant l lactis vaccine was developed using the ptrkh2 plasmid a high-copy-number escherichia coli-l shuttle vector 1 l lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 secreted-protein plasmid carrying the usp45 signal peptide spusp45 nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment c tetc and 14 of the 38 c-terminal repeats 14cdta of nontoxic c difficile toxin a tcda and 2 l lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 membrane-anchored plasmid carrying spusp45 tetc 14cdta and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein m6 cwam6 then 32 male syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups n = 8 each for gavage of normal saline blank control and l lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector secreted-protein plasmid and membrane-anchored plasmid respectively after 1-week gavage of clindamycin the animals were administered with c difficile spore suspension general symptoms and intestinal pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy respectively protein levels of anti-tcda igg/iga antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by tcda treatment with or without anti-tcda serum pre-incubation or treatment apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry fl assay expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction pcr assay results after the c difficile challenge the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4 indicating that the cdi animal model was established in hamster of the 3 immunization groups secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities body weight decreases and pathological scores with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group p < 0.05 the tilter of igg antibody directed against tcda was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty plasmid group p < 0.05 while the corresponding titer of iga antibody directed against tcda had no substantial differences p > 0.05 the anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml tcda with the best protective effect achieved by anti-tcda serum pre-incubation the incidences of tcda-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group p < 0.05 mcp-1 icam-1 il-6 and gro-1 mrna expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups conclusion recombinant l lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing cdi in the hamster model thus providing an alternative for immunization of c difficile-associated diseases
background human metapneumovirus hmpv has been shown to cause respiratory infection accounting for approximately 7% of all such disease and contributes to the development of asthma in humans hmpv has a worldwide distribution with infectivity rates approaching 100% and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk from viral exposure no anti-hmpv vaccine is available and diagnosis is primarily based on in-house molecular or serological tests in part due to limited availability of recombinant hmpv antigens objective to generate a panel of hmpv-derived recombinant antigens develop standardised elisa systems for hmpv igg detection and explore the nature of b cell memory against hmpv to underpin future vaccine studies study design hmpv viral rna was isolated from a clinical specimen and rt-pcr was conducted the hmpv m and p genes were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli the hmpv n gene was cloned and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system each purified recombinant antigens was subsequently employed in hmpv-specific elisa results high-level expression and purification of both hmpv matrix m 10 mg/g cells and phosphoprotein p 3.82 mg/g cells were achieved in an e coli expression system recombinant hmpv n was successfully expressed in and purified from the baculovirus expression system overall a 99% hmpv igg seroprevalence was observed n = 96 using hmpv m- n-and p-elisa respectively the m antigen proved to be the most diagnostically useful with 99% of specimens tested exhibiting anti-m protein reactivity a high correlation was observed between anti-m and n igg reactivity r = 0.96 with significant correlation also evident for anti-n and p igg reactivity r = 0.74 lowest correlation was evident for anti-m and p igg reactivity r = 0.57 finally the first demonstration of hmpv-specific b cell memory ranging 1-15 spot forming cells sfc/million cells was achieved against m and p antigens in 40% of individuals tested conclusion this work describes robust diagnostic systems for hmpv and new insight into antigen-specific b cell memory against hmpv
sporadic fatal outbreaks of disease in humans and non-human primates caused by ebola or marburg viruses have driven research into the characterization of these viruses with the hopes of identifying host tropisms and potential reservoirs such an understanding of the relatedness of newly discovered filoviruses may help to predict risk factors for outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in humans and/or non-human primates recent discoveries such as three distinct genotypes of reston ebolavirus unexpectedly discovered in domestic swine in the philippines as well as a new species bundibugyo ebolavirus the recent discovery of lloviu virus as a potential new genus cuevavirus within filoviridae and germline integrations of filovirus-like sequences in some animal species bring new insights into the relatedness of filoviruses their prevalence and potential for transmission to humans these new findings reveal that filoviruses are more diverse and may have had a greater influence on the evolution of animals than previously thought herein we review these findings with regard to the implications for understanding the host range prevalence and transmission of filoviridae published by elsevier b v
coronaviruses are positive-stranded rna viruses that infect a variety of hosts resulting in a range of symptoms from gastrointestinal illness to respiratory distress bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to mers-coronavirus sars-coronavirus and the human coronaviruses 229e and nl63 the bat fauna of central asia which link china to eastern europe are relatively less studied than other regions of the world kazakhstan is the world's ninth largest country however little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses in this study bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus alphacoronavirus in addition two distinct lineages of kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from china france spain and south africa suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions our study highlights the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases
background the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel 11 vaccine targets for protective immunity against sars-cov-2 consistent with observations for 12 sars-cov a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 sars outbreak early reports 13 identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for sars cov-2.14 methods in this study we leveraged hla-i and hla-ii t cell epitope prediction tools from 15 recon® real-time epitope computation for oncology our bioinformatic pipeline that was 16 developed using proteomic profiling of individual hla-i and hla-ii alleles to predict rules for 17 peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles we applied these binding predictors to viral 18 genomes from the coronaviridae family and specifically to identify sars-cov-2 t cell 19 epitopes 20 2 results to test the suitability of these tools to identify viral t cell epitopes we first validated 1 hla-i and hla-ii predictions on coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the virus 2 pathogen database and analysis resource vipr database we then use our hla-i and hla-ii 3 predictors to identify 11776 hla-i and 7991 hla-ii candidate binding peptides across all 12 4 open reading frames orfs of sars-cov-2 this extensive list of identified candidate peptides 5 is driven by the length of the orfs and the significant number of hla-i and hla-ii alleles that 6 we are able to predict 74 and 83 respectively providing over 99% coverage for the us 7 european and asian populations for both hla-i and hla-ii from our sars-cov-2 predicted 8 peptide-hla-i allele pairs 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the vipr 9 database originating from other forms of coronaviruses 320 of these pairs 89.1% had a 10 positive mhc-binding assay result this analysis reinforces the validity our predictions
introduction virus-like particle vlp vaccines face significant challenges in their translation from laboratory models to routine clinical administration while some vlp vaccines thrive and are readily adopted into the vaccination schedule others are restrained by regulatory obstacles proprietary limitations or finding their niche amongst the crowded vaccine market often the necessity to supplant an existing vaccination regimen possesses an immediate obstacle for the development of a vlp vaccine despite any preclinical advantages identified over the competition novelty adaptability and formulation compatibility may prove invaluable in helping place vlp vaccines at the forefront of vaccination technology areas covered the purpose of this review is to outline the diversity of vlp vaccines vlp-specific immune responses and to explore how modern formulation and delivery techniques can enhance the clinical relevance and overall success of vlp vaccines expert commentary the role of formation science with an emphasis on the diversity of immune responses induced by vlp is underrepresented amongst clinical trials for vlp vaccines harnessing such diversity particularly through the use of combinations of select excipients and adjuvants will be paramount in the development of vlp vaccines article history
vaccination is historically one of the most successful strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases for safety reasons modern vaccinology tends toward the usage of inactivated or attenuated microorganisms and uses predominantly subunit vaccines the antigens need to be clearly defined pure stable appropriately composed and properly presented to the immune system of the host differing ratios of various proportions between specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses are essential for conferring the required protection in the case of individual vaccines to stimulate both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells the antigens must be processed and presented to both antigen-presentation pathways mhc i and mhc ii protein antigens delivered by vaccination are processed as extracellular antigens however extracellularly delivered antigen can be directed towards intracellular presentation pathways in conjugation with molecules involved in antigen cross-presentation e g heat shock proteins or by genomic-dna vaccination in this overview current knowledge of the host immune response to dna vaccines is summarized in the introduction the subsequent sections discuss techniques for enhancing dna vaccine efficacy such as dna delivery to specific tissues delivery of dna to the cell cytoplasm or nucleus and enhancement of the immune response using molecular adjuvants finally the prospects of dna vaccination and ongoing clinical trials with various dna vaccines are discussed
the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv belongs to the coronavirus family which causes acute diarrhea in pigs with higher mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks old the pedv is one of the major concerns of the pig industry around the world including asian countries and noth america since first identified in europe currently there is no pedv licensed vaccine to effectively prevent this disease this study was performed for the development of a mucosal pedv vaccine and b subunit of cholera toxin ctb as a carrier was employed to surpass the tolerogenic nature of galt and induce potent immune responses against the target antigen fused to ctb an epitope s1d alone or conjugated with ctb was constructed into the tobacco chloroplasts expression vector which is controlled under the chloroplast rrna operon promoter with t7g10 5′ utr and the psba 3′utr as a terminator the homoplastomic lines were obtained by third round screening via organogenesis from the leaf tissues which were verified by pcr with antigen and chloroplast specific primers and then confirmed by southern blot analysis while the expression level of the s1d alone as detected by western blotting was approximately 0.07% of total soluble protein the ctb-s1d fusion protein was expressed up to 1.4%. the fusion protein showed binding to the intestinal membrane gm1-ganglioside receptor demonstrating its functionality the result shows that the highest expression of s1d could be achieved by fusion with a stable ctb protein and chloroplast transformation furthermore the ctb-s1d expressed in chloroplasts of nicotiana tabacum cv maryland could be assembled to pentameric form which increases the possibility to develop a mucosal vaccine against pedv this study describes a protocol for improved plant expression of a porcine epidemic diarrhea immunogen by utilisation of a ctb fusion protein and chloroplast transformation the results show that the production of ctb fusion antigen was twenty times higher than antigen alone in transplastomic plant
emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health throughout the world over the past decade west nile virus wnv dengue virus denv and chikungunya virus chikv have caused annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis hemorrhagic fever\shock syndromes and arthritis respectively currently no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines exist for use in humans to combat or prevent these viral infections thus there is a pressing need to define the virus-host interactions that govern immunity and infection outcome recent technological breakthroughs in 'omics' resources and high-throughput based assays are beginning to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and improve on current strategies for vaccine design in this review we highlight studies with wnv and discuss how traditional and systems based approaches are being used to rapidly identify novel host targets for therapeutic intervention and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the host response to virus infection
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv first emerged in the united states in 2013 causing high mortality and morbidity in neonatal piglets with immense economic losses to the swine industry pedv is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily in porcine intestinal cells pedv vaccines are available in asia and europe and conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the united states but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating pedv from swine populations are questionable in this study the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of pedv which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells dcs expressing langerin was assessed the pedv s antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant this approach known as "dendritic cell targeting" greatly improved pedv s antigen-specific t cell interferon-␥ responses in the cd4 pos cd8 pos t cell compartment in pigs as early as 7 days upon transdermal administration when the vaccine protein was targeted to langerin pos dcs systemically through intramuscular vaccination it induced higher serum igg and iga responses in pigs though these responses require a booster dose and the magnitude of t cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination we conclude that pedv spike protein domains targeting langerinexpressing dendritic cells significantly increased cd4 t cell immune responses in pigs the results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs
rotavirus c rvc has been detected increasingly in humans and swine in different countries including the us it is associated with significant economic losses due to diarrheal disease in nursing piglets in this study we aimed1 to determine the prevalence of rvc in healthy and diarrheic suckling piglets on us farms and 2 to evaluate if maternal antibody ab levels were associated with protection of newborn suckling piglets against rvc there was a significantly higher prevalence p = 0.0002 of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested 76.1% were rvc rna positive fecal rvc rna was detected in significantly p = 0.0419 higher quantities and more frequently in piglets with diarrhea compared with healthy ones 82.5 vs 69.9%. with the exception of the historic strain cowden g1 genotype field rvc strains do not replicate in cell culture which is a major impediment for studying rvc pathogenesis and immunity to circumvent this we generated rvc virus-like particles vlps for cowden g1 rv0104 g3 and rv0143 g6 and used them as antigens in elisa to detect swine rvc abs in serum and milk from the sows using rvc-vlp ab elisa we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower rvc iga and igg ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters thus our data suggest that insufficient lactogenic protection provided by gilts plays a key role in the development of and the increased prevalence of clinical rvc disease
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts caused by the sfts virus sftsv a phlebovirus in the family bunyaviridae is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease that impacts humans this disease manifests as a decreased blood cell count and multi-organ failure with a case-fatality rate of more than 12% in china because vaccines or antiviral drugs for the treatment of this disease are not available monitoring the sfts circulation in animals and controlling the tick-mammal cycle are important for preventing sfts monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of sftsv were generated to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay celisa for the detection of antibodies against sftsv infection in cattle the specificity and sensitivity of celisa was assessed by comparing the results of this assay to those of an immunofluorescence assay ifa the results of the celisa using 416 field bovine serum samples and laboratory-immunized positive sera showed 98.1% consistency with those of the ifa the celisa used in this study did not show cross-reactivity with antisera against other viral cattle diseases the celisa presented in this study can be applied to detect antibodies against sftsv in cattle
recent studies have established the feasibility of subunit-based experimental vaccines to protect animals from lethal poxvirus infection individual outer membrane proteins from intracellular and extracellular virions of vaccinia virus when delivered in the form of either dna vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines produced from baculovirus-infected insect cells were able to protect mice from the vaccinia virus challenge and rhesus macaques from the monkeypox virus challenge the polyvalent formulations with various combinations of the four poxvirus antigens a27 l1 b5 and a33 achieved better protection than the monovalent formulation using only one of these antigens however it is not clear whether any of the remaining outer membrane poxvirus proteins can further improve the efficacy of the current polyvalent formulations in this study we conducted detailed analysis on the immunogenicity of d8 a previously reported protective antigen from intracellular mature virions our results indicated that d8 induced strong protective antibody responses and was effective in improving the efficacy of previously reported polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations therefore d8 is an excellent candidate antigen to be included in the final polyvalent subunit-based poxvirus vaccines
due to the enormous capacity of staphylococcus aureus to acquire antibiotic resistance it becomes imperative to develop vaccines for decreasing the risk of its life-threatening infections peptidoglycan pgn is a conserved and major component of s aureus cell wall however it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen in this study we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide named map27 which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of pgn after immunization with map27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time anti-map27 serum bound directly to s aureus or pgn immunization with map27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of balb/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after s aureus lethal-challenge the percentage of ifn-γ + cd3 + t cells and il-17 + cd4 + t cells in spleen as well as the levels of ifn-γ il-17a/f and ccl3 in spleen and lung significantly increased in the map27-immunized mice after infection moreover in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated s aureus with splenocytes isolated from map27-immunized mice stimulated the production of ifn-γ and il-17a/f our findings demonstrated that map27 as a thymus-dependent antigen is efficient at eliciting t cell-mediated responses to protect mice from s aureus infection this study sheds light on a possible strategy to design vaccines against s aureus
rabies is a vaccine-preventable neglected tropical viral zoonosis it occurs worldwide creating a very heavy burden in many developing countries including nepal dogs are the principle vector for the transmission of this disease in urban areas vaccination is the most important preventive measure in areas where dogs are the principle source of infection this study was conducted with the aim of detecting virus-neutralising antibodies and associated factors against rabies in vaccinated household dogs of kathmandu valley blood samples were collected from 110 vaccinated pet dogs in kathmandu bhaktapur and lalitpur districts of nepal the samples were taken to the laboratory of the national zoonosis and food hygiene research center where serum was separated an indirect immuneenzymatic assay platelia tm rabies ii kit ad usum veterinarium biorad china was used for the detection of rabies virus anti-glycoprotein antibodies in the dog serum samples following the manufacturer's recommendations and instructions optical density values for unknown samples were compared with the positive sera titers in quantification tests obtained after a direct reading on the standard curve results were expressed as equivalent units per ml eu/ml of the total samples 89.09% exceeded the required seroconversion level � 0.5 eu/ml another 9.09% did not reach the seroconversion level 0.125-0.5 eu/ml and 1.81% had undetectable seroconversion levels <0.125 eu/ml suggesting that the animal had not plos one
the nucleotide sequence of a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv was determined transfection of marc-145 cells with capped in vitro transcripts derived from a full-length cdna clone of the viral genome resulted in infectious prrsv with growth characteristics similar to that of the parental virus primer extension analysis revealed that during replication the viral polymerase corrected the two nonviral guanosine residues present at the 5v terminus of the transfected transcripts animal studies showed that the cloned virus induced hyperthermia persistent viremia and antibody response similar to that observed with the parental virus contact transmission occurred rapidly within 3 days of introduction of naïve pigs into the group of clone virus-inoculated pigs these results suggest that the cloned virus retains the in vivo virulence and contagion properties of the parental virus thus providing the background for reverse genetics manipulation in systematic examination of attenuation and virulence phenotypes d
it is believed today that nucleocapsid protein n of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov is one of the most promising antigen candidates for vaccine design in this study three fragments of n protein of sars-cov were expressed in escherichia coli and analyzed by pooled sera of convalescence phase of sars patients three gene fragments of sars-n were cloned into pvax-1 and used to immunize balb/c mice by electroporation humoral by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and cellular by cell proliferation and cd4 + cd8 + assay immunity was detected by using recombinant n1 and n3 specific antigen results showed that n1 and n3 fragments of n protein expressed by e coli were able to react with sera of sars patients but n2 could not specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice could be induced significantly by inoculating sars-cov n1 and n3 dna vaccine in addition the immune response levels in n3 were significantly higher for antibody responses igg and igg1 but not igg2a and cell proliferation but not in cd4 + cd8 + assay compared to n1 vaccine the identification of antigenic n protein fragments has implications to provide basic information for the design of dna vaccine against sars-cov the present results not only suggest that dna immunization with pvax-n3 could be used as potential dna vaccination approaches to induce antibody in balb/c mice but also illustrates that gene immunization with these sars dna vaccines can generate different immune responses
middle east respiratory syndrome mers represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one-third of human patients recent data indicate that dromedaries represent an important source of infection although information regarding viral cell tropism and pathogenesis is sparse in the current study tissues of eight dromedaries receiving inoculation of mers-coronavirus mers-cov after recombinant modified-vaccinia-virus-ankara mva-s-vaccination n = 4 mvavaccination mock vaccination n = 2 and pbs application mock vaccination n = 2 respectively were investigated tissues were analyzed by histology immunohistochemistry immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy macrophages the acute disease was further accompanied by ciliary loss along with a lack of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 known to mediate virus entry dpp4 was mainly expressed by human lymphocytes and dromedary monocytes but overall the expression level was lower in dromedaries the present study underlines significant species-specific manifestations of mers and highlights ciliary loss as an important finding in dromedaries the obtained results promote a better understanding of coronavirus infections which pose major health challenges published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/ 2 scientific reports | 2018 89778 |
the vast majority of human pathogens colonize and invade at the mucosal surfaces preventing infection at these sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development however it is only recently that the stimulation of local immunity at the mucosal surfaces has become a primary objective in addition to inducing systemic immunity this review describes vaccine formulations designed for mucosal delivery to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue via intranasal administration the association of antigens with mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems is emphasised
some pathogenetic and clinical aspects of the respiratory tract infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv are discussed the acute and persistent stages of prrsv infection are treated separately special attention is given to the author's work on experimental dual infections with prrsv and other enzootic porcine respiratory viruses it was concluded that 1 studies on the interactions of prrsv and its target cell the pulmonary alveolar macrophage are very scarce so far the hypothesis of impaired macrophage function has not been proven 21 the possibility that prrsv causes disease in growing pigs in combination with other viral or bacterial infections has been demonstrated experimentally variation in disease resulting from such combined prrsv infections will probably hamper future research into disease mechanisms 3 there remains a need for more data on the clinicopathological significance of the persistent stage of prrsv infections 0 1997 elsevier science b v
a hallmark of disease is that most pathogens are able to infect more than one host species however for most pathogens we still have a limited understanding of how this affects epidemiology persistence and virulence of infections-including several zoonotic pathogens that reside in wild animal reservoirs and spillover into humans in this chapter we review the current knowledge of mallard anas platyrhynchos as host for pathogens this species is widely distributed often occupying habitats close to humans and livestock and is an important game bird species and the ancestor to domestic ducks-thereby being an excellent model species to highlight aspects of the wildlife domestic animal interface and the relevance for human health we discuss mallard as host for a range of pathogens but focus more in depth of it as a reservoir host for influenza a virus iav over the last decades iav research has surged prompted in part to the genesis and spread of highly pathogenic virus variants that have been devastating to domestic poultry and caused a number of human spillover infections the aim of this chapter is to synthesise and review the intricate interactions of virus host and environmental factors governing iav epidemiology and evolution
bats are known to harbor multiple paramyxoviruses despite the creation of two new genera aquaparamyxovirus and ferlavirus to accommodate this increasing diversity several recently isolated or characterized viruses remain unclassified beyond the subfamily level in the present study among 985 bats belonging to 6 species sampled in the belinga caves of gabon rna of an unclassified paramyxovirus belinga bat virus belpv was discovered in 14 african sheathtailed bats coleura afra one of which exhibited several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy and viral sequence was obtained in two animals phylogenetically belpv is related to j virus and beilong virus beipv two other unclassified paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents in the diseased belpv-infected c afra individual high viral load was detected in the heart and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by j virus belpv was not detected in other tested bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity with c afra in the two caves sampled suggesting that this virus may be host-specific for c afra the mode of transmission of this paramyxovirus in bat populations remains to be discovered
background wild birds are an important but to some extent under-studied reservoir for emerging pathogens we used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the delaware bay usa an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds findings analysis of shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus a sanderling sample yielded sequences with distant homology to avian nephritis virus 1 an astrovirus associated with acute nephritis in poultry a ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses conclusions our findings highlight shorebirds as a virus reservoir and the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants
vaccination continues to be the main approach to protect animals from infectious diseases until recently all licensed vaccines were developed using conventional technologies subunit vaccines are however gaining attention from researchers in the field of veterinary vaccinology and among these virus-like particles vlps represent one of the most appealing approaches vlps are robust protein cages in the nanometer range that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome they are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety vlps can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities in addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived vlps can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens vlps have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines here we review the current status of vlps as a vaccine technology in the veterinary field and discuss the potential advantages and challenges of this technology
the role that bats have played in the emergence of several new infectious diseases has been under review bats have been identified as the reservoir hosts of newly emergent viruses such as nipah virus hendra virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses this article expands on recent findings about bats and viruses and their relevance to human infections it briefly reviews the history of chiropteran viruses and discusses their emergence in the context of geography phylogeny and ecology the public health and trade impacts of several outbreaks are also discussed finally we attempt to predict where when and why we may see the emergence of new chiropteran viruses not have predicted the scientific interest bats would generate for centuries to come bats have long been recognized as hosts for viruses but for many years were associated only with rabies virus scientists then turned to these flying mammals as potential reservoirs of new and emerging viruses in 1974 sulkin and allen listed infections with alphaviruses flaviviruses arenaviruses paramyxoviruses reoviruses rhabdoviruses and a suite of nonclassified viruses both suborders within the order chiroptera were represented microchiroptera microbats and megachiroptera megabats including flying foxes and fruit and
background development an effective vaccine against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is urgent and limited information is available on vaccination in nonhuman primate nhp model we herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain rrbd protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model methods nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose low-dose and mock groupswhich were immunized with different doses of rrbd plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points 0 8 25 weeks immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation monkeys were challenged with mers-cov at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest x-rays nasal oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological virological and immunological tests conclusion robust and sustained immunological responses including neutralisation antibody were elicited by the rrbd vaccination besides rrbd vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys furthermore the rrbd vaccine decreased viral load of lung trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys these data in nhp paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against mers-cov infection
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus with worldwide distribution pdcov belongs to the deltacoronavirus dcov genus which mainly includes avian coronaviruses covs pdcov has the potential to infect human and chicken cells in vitro and also has limited infectivity in calves however the origin of pdcov in pigs the host range and cross-species infection of pdcov still remain unclear to determine whether pdcov really has the ability to infect chickens in vivo the three lines of chicken embryos and specific pathogen free spf chickens were inoculated with pdcov hnzk-02 strain to investigate pdcov infection in the current study our results indicated that pdcov can infect chicken embryos and could be continuously passaged on them furthermore we observed that pdcov-inoculated chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms and low fecal viral rna shedding pdcov rna could also be detected in multiple organs lung kidney jejunum cecum and rectum and intestinal contents of pdcov-inoculated chickens until 17 day post-inoculation by real-time quantitative pcr qrt-pcr a histology analysis indicated that pdcov caused mild lesions in the lung kidney and intestinal tissues these results prove the susceptibility of chickens to pdcov infection which might provide more insight about the cross-species transmission of pdcov
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a novel coronavirus that can cause vomiting and watery diarrhea in pigs and death in piglets since pdcov was first detected in 2009 in hong kong the prevalence of pdcov has increased in recent years resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry the coronavirus spike s protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies the presence of serum and milk iga antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity here an indirect anti-pdcov iga antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay pdcov s1 iga elisa using the purified s1 portion of s protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect pdcov iga antibodies in serum and sow's milk a receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the pdcov-s1-iga-elisa based on samples confirmed by ifa anti-pdcov iga antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for pdcov the indirect elisa method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk iga levels against pdcov in pig herds rapid detection of pdcov infection in pigs and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines handling editor sheela ramamoorthy manman lu and qiuge liu contributed equally to this work the online version of this article https //doi org/10.1007/s0070 5-020-04541 -6 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease estimated to cause severe infection in more than one million people each year particularly in developing countries of tropical areas several factors such as variable and nonspecific clinical manifestation existence of large number of serovars and asymptomatic hosts spreading infection poor sanitation and lack of an effective vaccine make prophylaxis difficult consequently there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to halt its spread all over the world in this study an immunoinformatics approach was employed to identify the most vital and effective immunogenic protein from the proteome of leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni strain l1-130 that may be suitable to stimulate a significant immune response aiding in the development of peptide vaccine against leptospirosis both b-cell and t-cell helper t-lymphocyte htl and cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitopes were predicted for the conserved and most immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein further the binding interaction of ctl epitopes with major histocompatibility complex class i mhc-i was evaluated using docking techniques a molecular dynamics simulation study was also performed to evaluate the stability of the resulting epitope-mhc-i complexes overall this study provides novel vaccine candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against leptospirosis
peeters j e geeroms r carman r j and wilkins t d 1986 significance of clostridium spiroforme in the enteritis-complex of commercial rabbits vet microbiol 12 25--31 commercial rabbits showing clinical signs of enteritis-complex were examined for the presence of clostridium spiroforme and its iota-like toxin the bacterium was detected by gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. from 29 strains of c spiroforme tested 26 were toxigenic originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries in 13.4% of the samples c spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature in the other samples c spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing escherichia coli 29.5% bacillus piliformis 10.3% rotaviruses 25.6% coronavirus 2.6% eimeria spp 44.9% and cryptosporidia 6.4%. in 33.3% of c spiroforme-containing samples more than one of these agents was present there was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in c spiroforme-positive and negative samples on the basis of these results as well as that of previous data we suggest that c spiroformemediated diarrhea is favoured by maldigestion initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is an important cause of respiratory tract disease in infants and the elderly currently no licensed vaccine against rsv is available here we describe the development of a safe and effective intranasal subunit vaccine that is based on recombinant fusion f protein bound to the surface of immunostimulatory bacterium-like particles blps derived from the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis different variants of f were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies assuming that f proteins mimicking the metastable prefusion form of rsv f expose a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than f proteins corresponding to the postfusion structure our results indicate that the recombinant soluble ectodomain of rsv f readily adopts a postfusion conformation generation of which cannot be prevented by c-terminal addition of a trimerization motif but whose formation is prevented by mutation of the two furin cleavage sites in f while the putative postfusion form of f is recognized well by the monoclonal antibody palivizumab this is much less so for the more potently neutralizing prefusion-specific antibodies d25 and am22 both addition of the trimerization motif and mutation of the furin cleavage sites increased the reactivity of f with d25 and am22 with the highest reactivity being observed for f proteins in which both these features were combined intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with blps loaded with this latter prefusion-like f protein blp-f resulted in the potent induction of f-specific immunoglobulins and in significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs upon rsv challenge moreover and in contrast to animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated rsv animals that received blp-f exhibited high levels of f-specific secretory iga in the nose and rsv-neutralizing antibodies in sera but did not show symptoms of enhanced disease after challenge with rsv
diarrhoeic faeces from about 500 dogs were examined by negative stain electron microscopy as well as parvovims and some of the other recognised viral causes of gastroenteritis unusual "viruslike" particles were observed in about 8% of the samples the particles were spherical 100 nm to 300 nm in diameter and surrounded by a thick wall penetrated by numerous pores an additional 74 samples of normal faeces yielded no "virus-like" particles we do not know the nature of these particles

the aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of murine embryonic stem mescs to mouse hepatitis virus mhv-a59 and mouse minute virus mmvp and the effect of these viruses on germline transmission glt and the serological status of recipients and pups when recipients received 10 blastocysts each injected with 10 0 tcid 50 mhv-a59 three out of five recipients and four out of 14 pups from three litters became seropositive when blastocysts were injected with 10 -5 tcid 50 mmvp all four recipients and 14 pups from four litters remained seronegative the mescs replicated mhv-a59 but not mmvp mhv-a59 being cytolytic for mescs exposure of mescs to the viruses over four to five passages but not for 6 h affected glt recipients were seropositive for mhv-a59 but not for mmvp when mescs were cultured with the virus over four or five passages the data show that glt is affected by viruscontaminated mescs
pleomorphic enveloped virus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in the stools of symptomatic infants during an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in a neonatal intensive-care unit to determine the incidence of virus-like particles in the stool and their relation to gastrointestinal symptoms eight surveys of stools for the particles were conducted over 40 weeks the incidence of virus-like particles in the stool decreased from 69% to <100/0 over the study period most infants surveyed were premature overall 32 36% of 88 neonates were positive for virus-like particles statistically significant associations were found between virus-like particles in the stool and gastrointestinal symptoms within one week of each survey these symptoms included water-loss stools blood in the stool gastric retention bilious gastric aspirates and abdominal distention several infants with virus-like particles whose mothers had gastrointestinal or "flu-like" symptoms before delivery were identified in the community not part of the survey study
avian influenza is a significant economic burden on the poultry industry in geographical regions where it is enzootic it also poses a public health concern when avian influenza subtypes infect humans often with high mortality understanding viral genetic factors which positively contribute to influenza a virus iav fitnessinfectivity spread and pathogenesisis of great importance both for human and livestock health pb1-f2 is a small accessory protein encoded by iav and in mammalian hosts has been implicated in a wide range of functions that contribute to increased pathogenesis in the avian host the protein has been understudied despite high-level full-length conservation in avian iav isolates which is in contrast to the truncations of the pb1-f2 length frequently found in mammalian host isolates here we report that the presence of a full-length pb1-f2 protein from a low pathogenicity h9n2 avian influenza virus prolongs infectious virus shedding from directly inoculated chickens thereby enhancing transmission of the virus by lengthening the transmission window to contact birds as well as extending transmission the presence of a full-length pb1-f2 suppresses pathogenicity evidenced by an increased minimum lethal dose in embryonated chicken eggs and increasing survival in directly infected birds when compared to a virus lacking an orf for pb1-f2 we propose that there is a positive pressure to maintain a full-length functional pb1-f2 protein upon infection of avian hosts as it contributes to the effective transmission of iav in the field five supplementary tables and one supplementary figure are available in the online supplementary material

the majority of the neutralizing epitopes of papillomaviruses pv are conformation-specific and have not been fully characterised studies have to date been limited to a few hpv types only we analysed the epitopes on the major capsid protein l1 of human papillomavirus hpv type 31 using monoclonal antibodies mabs generated against hpv-31 virus-like particles vlps the type-specific mabs against hpv-31 were all found to be neutralizing and recognized conformation-dependent epitopes two other mabs directed against a conformational epitope were found to be cross-reactive with other hpv types and one of them was found to be cross-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies were further investigated using wild-type hpv-16 l1 vlps and two mutants the results obtained suggested the existence of a cross-neutralizing conformational epitope at the n-terminal part of the fg loop of the major capsid protein and the other four cross-reactive mabs recognized epitopes also located at the n-terminal part of the fg loop
pollination syndromes describe recurring adaptation to selection imposed by distinct pollinators we tested for pollination syndromes in merianieae melastomataceae which contain bee-buzz- hummingbird- flowerpiercer- passerine- bat-and rodent-pollinated species further we explored trait changes correlated with the repeated shifts away from buzzpollination which represents an 'adaptive plateau' in melastomataceae we used random forest analyses to identify key traits associated with the different pollinators of 19 merianieae species and estimated the pollination syndromes of 42 more species we employed morphospace analyses to compare the morphological diversity disparity among syndromes we identified three pollination syndromes 'buzz-bee' 'mixed-vertebrate' and 'passerine' characterized by different pollen expulsion mechanisms and reward types but not by traditional syndrome characters further we found that 'efficiency' rather than 'attraction' traits were important for syndrome circumscription contrary to syndrome theory our study supports the pooling of different pollinators hummingbirds bats rodents and flowerpiercers into the 'mixed-vertebrate' syndrome and we found that disparity was highest in the 'buzzbee' syndrome we conclude that the highly adaptive buzz-pollination system may have prevented shifts towards classical pollination syndromes but provided the starting point for the evolution of a novel set of distinct syndromes all having retained multifunctional stamens that provide pollen expulsion reward and attraction
bats are carriers of potentially zoonotic viruses therefore it is crucial to identify viruses currently found in bats to better understand how they are maintained in bat populations and evaluate risks for transmission to other species adenoviruses have been previously detected in bats throughout the world but sampling is still limited in this study 30 pooled-guano samples were collected from a cave roost of myotis velifer in oklahoma a portion of the dna polymerase gene from adenoviridae was amplified successfully in 18 m velifer samples however dna sequence was obtained from only 6 of these m velifer samples samples contained viral dna that was 3.1% different from each other but 33% different than the novel viral sequence found in the july 2017 samples phylogenetic analysis of these fragments confirmed our isolates were from the genus mastadenovirus and had genetic diversity ranging from 20 to 50% when compared to other bat adenoviruses
the goal of the influenza vaccine is to prevent influenza virus infection and control the yearly seasonal epidemic and pandemic however the presently available parenteral influenza vaccine induces only systemic humoral immunity which does not prevent influenza virus infection on the mucosal surface secretary iga antibodies play an important role in preventing natural infection moreover the iga antibody response mediates cross-protection against variant viruses in animal models thus a mucosal influenza vaccine that induces mucosal immunity would be a powerful tool to protect individuals from the influenza virus although the function of the mucosal immune system especially in the respiratory tract is not completely understood there are several studies underway to develop mucosal influenza vaccines here we will review current knowledge concerning the induction of iga the role of b-cell production of influenza virus specific iga antibodies in anti-influenza immunity and the role of humoral memory responses induced upon vaccination
canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a major cause of morbidity in dogs worldwide and is associated with a number of new and emerging pathogens in a large multi-centre european study the prevalences of four key emerging cird pathogens canine respiratory coronavirus crcov canine pneumovirus cnpnv influenza a and mycoplasma cynos m cynos were estimated and risk factors for exposure infection and clinical disease were investigated cird affected 66% 381/572 of the dogs studied including both pet and kennelled dogs disease occurrence and severity were significantly reduced in dogs vaccinated against classic cird agents canine distemper virus cdv canine adenovirus 2 cav-2 and canine parainfluenza virus cpiv but substantial proportions 65.7% 201/306 of vaccinated dogs remained affected crcov and cnpnv were highly prevalent across the different dog populations with overall seropositivity and detection rates of 47% and 7.7% for crcov and 41.7% and 23.4% for cnpnv respectively and their presence was associated with increased occurrence and severity of clinical disease antibodies to crcov had a protective effect against crcov infection and more severe clinical signs of cird but antibodies to cnpnv did not involvement of m cynos and influenza a in cird was less apparent despite 45% of dogs being seropositive for m cynos only 0.9% were pcr positive for m cynos only 2.7% of dogs were seropositive for influenza a and none were positive by pcr
influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and parainfluenza type 3 virus pi-3v are the major viral agents which are consistently involved in causing lower respiratory tract disease in humans and animals the virus infection begins in the upper respiratory tract where immune responses are initiated and then progresses to the lower respiratory tract where destruction of cells and tissues leads to bronchitis bronchiolitis and pneumonia which is occasionally fatal nanoparticle vaccines incorporating antigenic components from influenza rsv or pi-3v have been shown to be capable of stimulating mucosal and systemic immune responses which can prevent the spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract the encapsulation of viral proteins within nanoparticles may also facilitate production of respiratory vaccines which are efficacious in infants where presence of maternally derived antibodies can reduce vaccine efficacy . 
| antibodies have been used for more than 100 years in the therapy of infectious diseases but a new generation of highly potent and/or broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies sometimes referred to as 'super-antibodies' offers new opportunities for intervention the isolation of these antibodies most of which are rarely induced in human infections has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single b cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases super-antibodies offer promise for the prophylaxis and therapy of infections with a range of viruses including those that are highly antigenically variable and those that are newly emerging or that have pandemic potential the next few years will be decisive in the realization of the promise of super-antibodies nature reviews | immunology volume 18 | may 2018 | 297 reviews © 2 0 1 8 m a c m i l l a n p u b l i s h e r s l i m i t e d p a r t o f s p r i n g e r n a t u r e . a l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d .genetically engineered mouse antibodies in which the protein sequence has been modified to increase its similarity to human antibodies thereby decreasing its potential immunogenicity

negative staining electron microscopy was used to identify viruses in 166 normal and 62 dianttoeal faecal samples from 208 cats admitted to an animal shelter during a 16-month period march 1984 to june 1985 on the basis of size and shape 7 distinct viral types were detected 24 nm parvovirus-like particles 30 nm astrovirus 30 nm picornavirus-like particles reovirus rotavirus coronavirus and a 75 nm "togavirus-like" particle the incidence of these particles in the 208 cats was 11% 7% 6% 0.4% 5% 1 yo and 1 o h respectively virus isolation studies using 40 of the faecal samples succeeded in isolating reovirus 1 in 2 cases immune electron microscope studies demonstrated the presence of antibody in a human serum to cat astrovirus but failed to clarify the identity of the parvovirus-like particles and picornavirus-like particles other than showing that some of the patvovirus-like particles were not related to feline panleukopenia virus it was found that parvovirus-like particles astrovirus picomavirus-like particles reovirus and rotavirus could be excreted by cats with normal faeces as well as cats with diarrhoeal faeces aust vet j 64 100-1 05materials and methodsfaeces were collected usually on a weekly basis from march 1984 to june 1985 from the royal society for the virology department fairfield hospital yarra bend rd fairfield victoria 3078 address for correspondence parkville victoria 3052 t school of veterinary l cience university of me1 b ourne100faeces were processed as described by oliver et a1 1985 briefly faecal specimens were prepared as a 20% wt/vol suspension in hank's complete balanced salt solution vigorously shaken then centrifuged twice at low speed to deposit debris the clarified supernatant fluid was then concentrated and further purified by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion
background gastrointestinal symptoms in particular diarrhoea are common in non-treated hiv-1 infected individuals although various enteric pathogens have been implicated the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of hiv-1 infected patients our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics methods in this study stool samples of 196 hiv-1 infected persons including 29 persons with diarrhoea were examined for enteropathogens and hiv-1 a search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cdna-aflp combined with roche-454 sequencing vidisca-454
pseudotyped viral particle production has been used extensively and broadly for many viruses to evaluate levels of neutralizing antibodies viral entry inhibitors and vaccine immunogenicity this assay is extremely safe and useful alternative to live virus-based assay without the need for high containment facilities in this chapter we describe the generation of mers-cov pseudotyped viral particles merspp expressing fulllength spike protein using second-generation lentiviral packaging system this platform is optimized to generate high titer of merspp and to test sera from different mammalian species
background ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers vhfs in humans and non-human primates with the exceptions of reston virus restv which is not pathogenic for humans in human vhf cases extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the igg responses to nucleoprotein np and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein gp 12 are the major indicator of protective immunity on the other hand the immune responses in non-human primates especially naturally infected ones have not yet been elucidated in detail and the significance of the antibody responses against np and gp 12 in restv-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear in this study we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the restv epizootic in 1996 in the philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally restv-infected non-human primates results the antibody responses were analyzed using igg-elisa an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay ifa and a pseudotyped vsv-based neutralizing nt assay antigen-capture ag-elisa was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens we found that the anti-gp 12 responses but not the anti-np responses closely were correlated with the neutralization responses as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the restv-infected cynomolgus macaques additionally by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as ifnγ il8 il-12 and mip1α in the convalescent phase sera conclusions these results imply that both the antibody response to gp 12 and the proinflammatory innate responses play significant roles in the recovery from restv infection in cynomolgus macaques
the advent of unbiased metagenomic virus discovery has revolutionized studies of virus biodiversity and evolution despite this our knowledge of the virosphere including in mammalian species remains limited we used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to identify rna viruses in european field voles and rabbits accordingly we identified a number of novel rna viruses including astrovirus rotavirus a picorna-like virus and a narmovirus paramyxovirus in addition we identified a sobemovirus and a novel luteovirus that likely originated from the rabbit diet these newly discovered viruses were often divergent from those previously described the novel astrovirus was most closely related to a virus sampled from the rodent-eating european roller bird coracias garrulous pcr screening revealed that the novel narmovirus in the uk field vole had a prevalence of approximately 4% and shared common ancestry with other rodent narmoviruses sampled globally two novel rotavirus a sequences were detected in a uk field vole and a french rabbit the latter with a prevalence of 5%. finally a highly divergent picorna-like virus found in the gut of the french rabbit virus was only~35% similar to an arilivirus at the amino acid level suggesting the presence of a novel viral genus within the picornaviridae
feline oral squamous cell carcinoma foscc may be the best naturally-occurring model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc hnscc can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus hpvnegative cancers and hpv-positive cancers where hpv is the causative agent previous studies in foscc have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific pcr primers that may be insensitive to the detection of pvs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences virocap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate dna and rna viruses in this study we used a metagenomic approach using virocap for dna viruses in 20 foscc 9 normal feline oral mucosal and 8 suspected pv positive control samples we tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in foscc compared to normal oral mucosa the virome of the foscc and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 35% and 22% feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 10% and 0% alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 10% and 0% fiv 0% and 22% epstein-barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 5% and 0% and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples 5% and 0% respectively felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 foscc samples a virus was not associated consistently with foscc if pvs have a role in foscc it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role foscc appears most closely related to hpv-negative hnscc future research on foscc should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes s chu veterinary microbiology 240 2020 108491 0378-1135/ published by elsevier b v t
highly pathogenic avian influenza a hpai viruses specifically h5n1 strains cause widespread morbidity and mortality in domestic and wild bird populations and recent outbreaks have resulted in severe economic losses although still largely confined to birds more than 300 human cases resulting in deaths have been reported to the world health organization these sporadic human cases result from direct transmission from infected birds however a sustained outbreak of hpai h5n1 increases the potential for the emergence of a human pandemic strain one approach to the containment of hpai h5n1 is the development of vaccines for use in poultry currently the majority of avian influenza vaccines for poultry are traditional whole-virus vaccines produced in eggs although highly efficacious these vaccines are hindered by long production times inflexibility in quickly altering anti-
disease outbreaks characterized by reproductive failure and/or neurologic disorders which are commonly referred as ''porcine reproductive and neurologic syndrome prns'' were observed in many swine farms in iowa and other states although an infectious cause was suspected to account for the disease no conclusive diagnosis had been reached with respect to conventional infectious agents extensive laboratory diagnostic investigation on suspect cases repeatedly resulted in the isolation of a cytopathic enveloped virus of 50-60 nm in size from nervous and second lymphoid tissues and sera and to reflect its unknown identity named ''virus x''. the presence of virus particle with morphological characteristics similar to virus x in tissues from affected animals was also observed on thin-section positive-staining electron microscopy isolates of virus x were not readily recognized by antibodies raised against any known viruses pathogenic to swine but by antisera collected from animals surviving clinical episode indicating that virus x is likely a previously unrecognized agent pregnant sows experimentally inoculated with virus x isuyp604671 or homogenate filtrate of tissues from a clinically affected animal developed clinical signs and pathological changes similar to field observations including the loss of pregnancy furthermore caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived young pigs developed mild encephalomyelitis lesions in brains after experimental inoculation with the virus or the tissue homogenate although clinical neurologic signs were not observed more importantly virus x was re-isolated from all inoculated animals while control pigs remained negative for the virus during the study collectively virus x is a novel viral agent responsible for prns and remains to be further characterized for taxonomical identity #
the rapid spread of the corona virus pandemic is an existential problem for many people in numerous countries so far there is no effective vaccine protection or proven therapy available against the sars-cov-2 virus in this review we describe the role of passive immunization in times of the corona virus passive immunization could be a bridging technology to improve the immune defense of critically ill patients until better approaches with effective medications are available
objectives the present study was conducted to evaluate the activity of nanometer propolis flavone npf on inhibiting porcine parvovirus ppv in vitro and in vivo methods in vitro the effect of npf on cellular infectivity of ppv was carried out before and after adding drug and simultaneous adding and ppv after being mixed in vivo the anti-ppv effect of npf in guinea pigs was performed results the results showed that npf could significantly inhibit ppv infecting porcine kidney-pk- 15 cells compared with propolis flavone pf and the activity of npf was the best in preadding drug pattern npf at high and medium doses was able to observably restrain ppv copying in lung gonad blood and spleen decrease the impact of ppv on weight of guinea pigs and improve hemagglutination inhibition hi of ppv in serum in addition it could also increase the contents of il-2 and il-6 in serum after ppv challenge conclusion these results indicated that npf could significantly improve the anti-ppv activity of pf and its high concentration possessed the best efficacy therefore npf would be expected to be exploited into a new-style antiviral drug
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus in the united states highly virulent pedv strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms to study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission we developed a molecular clone of pedv strain pc22a the infectious-clone-derived pedv icpedv replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs resulting in lethal disease in vivo importantly recombinant pedv was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus using reverse genetics we removed open reading frame 3 orf3 and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein rfp gene to generate icpedv-⌬orf3-rfp icpedv-⌬orf3-rfp replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo was efficiently transmitted among pigs and produced lethal disease outcomes however the diarrheic scores in icpedv-⌬orf3-rfp-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus-or icpedv-infected pigs and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of pc22a together these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting states in 2013 and has since killed 10% of u s farm pigs though the disease has been circulating internationally for decades the lack of a rapid reverse-genetics platform for manipulating pedv and identifying genetic factors that impact transmission and virulence has hindered the study of this important agricultural disease here we present a dna-based infectious-clone system that replicates the pathogenesis of circulating u s strain pc22a both in vitro and in piglets this infectious clone can be used both to study the genetics virulence and transmission of pedv coronavirus and to inform the creation of a live attenuated pedv vaccine r 2016 characterization of a pathogenic full-length cdna clone and transmission model for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain pc22a 71e01451-15
environmental modifications are leading to biodiversity changes loss and habitat disturbance this in turn increases contacts between wildlife and hence the risk of transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases we analyzed the environment and land use using remote spatial data around the sampling locations of bats positive for coronavirus 21 sites and astrovirus 11 sites collected in 43 sites a clear association between viruses and hosts was observed viruses associated to synanthropic bat genera such as myotis or scotophilus were associated to highly transformed habitats with human presence while viruses associated to fruit bat genera were correlated with natural environments with dense forest grassland areas and regions of high elevation in particular group c betacoronavirus were associated with mosaic habitats found in anthropized environments
we identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in china a new bat-hku2-like porcine coronavirus porcine enteric alphacoronavirus the gds04 strain of this coronavirus shares high aa identities >90% with the reported bat-hku2 strains in coronaviridae-wide conserved domains suggesting that the gds04 strain belongs to the same species as hku2
hepatitis e virus hev is a viral pathogen transmitted primarily via fecal-oral route in humans hev mainly causes acute hepatitis and is responsible for large outbreaks of hepatitis across the world the case fatality rate of hev-induced hepatitis ranges from 0.5 to 3% in young adults and up to 30% in infected pregnant women hev strains infecting humans are classified into four genotypes hev strains from genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic whereas those from genotypes 1 and 2 have no known animal reservoirs recently notable progress has been accomplished for better understanding of hev biology and infection such as chronic hev infection in vitro cell culture system quasienveloped hev virions functions of the hev proteins mechanism of hev antagonizing host innate immunity hev pathogenesis and vaccine development however further investigation on the cross-species hev infection host tropism vaccine efficacy and hev-specific antiviral strategy is still needed this review mainly focuses on molecular biology and infection of hev and offers perspective new insight of this enigmatic virus
human memory b cells and plasma cells represent a rich source of antibodies that have been selected in response to human pathogens in the last decade different methods have been developed to interrogate the human memory repertoire and isolate monoclonal antibodies i will discuss how a target-agnostic approach based on highthroughput screening of antibodies produced by cultured b cells and plasma cells has not only provided potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against a range of pathogens but has also advanced our understanding of basic aspects of the immune response from host-pathogen interaction to the role of somatic mutations in affinity maturation and in the diversification of the antibody response most surprisingly this approach has also revealed a new mechanism of diversification based on templated insertion of non-ig dna into antibody genes that we discovered in the context of the immune response to malaria infection

background canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 was first identified in the late 1970s it causes intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea in kennels and dog shelters worldwide since its emergence cpv-2 has been replaced with new genetic variants . currently information about the genotype prevalence of cpv-2 in vietnam is limited in the present study we investigated the genotype prevalence and distribution of cpv-2 in the three regions of vietnam methods rectal swabs were collected from 260 dogs with suspected cpv-2 infection from northern central and southern vietnam from november 2016 to february 2018 all samples were identified as parvovirus positive by real-time pcr and further genotyping was performed using a simpleprobe® real-time pcr assay results of the 260 vietnamese cpv-2 isolates 6 isolates 2.31% were identified as cpv-2a 251 isolates 96.54% were identified as cpv-2c and 3 isolates 1.15% were untypable using the simpleprobe® real-time pcr assay in northern vietnam the percentages of cpv-2a and cpv-2c were 2.97% 3/101 and 97.3% 98/101 respectively in central vietnam the percentages of cpv-2a and cpv-2c were 1.11% 1/90 and 98.89% 89/90 respectively in southern vietnam the percentages of cpv-2a and cpv-2c were 3.03% 2/66 and 96.97% 64/66 respectively cpv-2b was not observed in this study the vp2 genes of cpv-2c in vietnam are more genetically similar to those of cpv-2c strains in china and taiwan than to those of prototype cpv-2c strains fj222821 or the first vietnamese cpv-2c ab120727 conclusion the present study provides evidence that cpv-2c is the most prevalent variant in vietnam phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent vietnamese cpv-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with asian cpv-2c strains
infectious diseases that are transmitted from wildlife hosts to humans such as the ebola virus and mers virus can be difficult to understand because the pathogens emerge from complex multifaceted ecological interactions we use a wildlife-pathogen system-prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus and the plague bacterium yersinia pestis-to describe aspects of disease ecology that apply to many cases of emerging infectious disease we show that the monitoring and surveillance of hosts and vectors during the buildup to disease outbreaks are crucial for understanding pathogen-transmission dynamics and that a community-ecology framework is important to identify reservoir hosts incorporating multidisciplinary approaches and frameworks may improve wildlife-pathogen surveillance and our understanding of seemingly sporadic and rare pathogen outbreaks
bats are natural reservoirs of the largest proportion of viral zoonoses among mammals thus understanding the conditions for pathogen persistence in bats is essential to reduce human risk miniopterus schreibersii bat species in catalonia we find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of m schreibersii on cross-species mixing with m myotis and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity the virus would not persist in the single colony of m myotis our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for eblv-1 progression in m schreibersii our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role
around 10000 people die each year due to severe dengue disease and two-thirds of the world population lives in a region where dengue disease is endemic there has been remarkable progress in dengue virus vaccine development however there are no licensed antivirals for dengue disease and none appear to be in clinical trials we took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds we identified n-desmethylclozapine fluoxetine hydrochloride and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers dengue virus rna levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells and this effect was specific to dengue virus as other flaviviruses such as japanese encephalitis virus and west nile virus or other rna viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus were not affected by these inhibitors all three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations ic 50 s in the high-nanomolar range estimation of negative-strand rna intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage most probably at the initiation of viral rna replication finally we show that inhibition is most likely due to the modulation of the endolysosomal pathway and induction of autophagy
the newly emerged duck tembusu virus dtmuv is responsible for considerable economic loss in waterfowlraising areas in china since 2010 meanwhile the virulent newcastle disease virus ndv has also caused sporadic outbreaks in waterfowl the individual vaccines against both diseases are available however there is no bivalent or combined vaccine for either disease here we constructed a recombinant ndv-vectored vaccine candidate that expresses the pre-membrane prm and envelope e genes from dtmuv designated as agm/ prm + e the foreign prm and e proteins were stably expressed in agm/prm + e and exhibited similar pathogenicity but higher growth kinetics than those of the parental virus the agm/prm + e carries a fusion cleavage site in accordance with avirulent viruses that have been frequently isolated from waterfowl and induced remarkably p < 0.001 higher ndv-specific hemagglutination inhibition hi titers than commercially available live ndv vaccines lasota strain the agm/prm + e also elicited significantly higher p < 0.05 virus neutralization vn titers than commercially available dtmuv inactivated vaccines hb strain the agm/ prm + e not only provided complete protection against ndv challenge but also reduced the gross lesions on ovarian folliculi and provided 80% protection against dtmuv in ducks we note that the agm/prm + e vaccine can prevent challenged ducks from shedding of ndv and dtmuv our results suggest that the candidate vaccine agm/prm + e would help decrease ndv and dtmuv transmissions in waterfowl raising areas in china

to determine the effectiveness of immunization strategies used in therapeutic antibody or vaccine development it is critical to assess the quality of immunization-induced polyclonal antibody responses here we developed a workflow that uses sensitive methods to quantitatively and qualitatively assess immune responses against foreign antigens with regard to antibody binding affinity and epitope diversity the application of such detailed assessments throughout an immunization campaign can significantly reduce the resources required to generate highly specific antibodies our workflow consists of the following two steps 1 the use of surface plasmon resonance to quantify antigen-specific antibodies and evaluate their apparent binding affinities and 2 the recovery of serum iggs using an automated small scale purification system followed by the determination of their epitope diversity using hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry we showed that these methods were sensitive enough to detect antigen-specific iggs in the nanogram/l range and that they provided information for differentiating the antibody responses of the various immunized animals that could not be obtained by conventional methods we also showed that this workflow can guide the selection of an animal that produces high affinity antibodies with a desired epitope coverage profile resulting in the generation of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibody clones with desirable functional profiles we postulate that this workflow will be an important tool in the development of effective vaccines to combat the highly sophisticated evasion mechanisms of pathogens
rotaviruses are an important cause of severe diarrheal illness in children globally we characterized rotaviruses sampled in humans insectivores shrews and rodents from urban and rural regions of zhejiang province china phylogenetic analyses revealed seven genotypic constellations of human rotaviruses with six different combinations of g and p genotypes -g3p 50.06% g9p 36.16% g1p 8.92% g2p 4.63% g3p 0.12% and g3p 0.12%.in rodents and shrews sampled from the same locality we identified a novel genotype constellation g32-p a novel p genotype p and two different au-1-like rotaviruses associated with a g3p genotype combination of particular note was a novel rotavirus from a human patient that was closely related to viruses sampled from rodents in the same region indicative of a local species jump in sum these data are suggestive of the cross-species transmission of rodent rotaviruses into humans and for reassortment among human and animal rotaviruses
coronaviruses covs are found in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals and constitute a risk for zoonotic and emerging infectious disease in poultry the genetic diversity evolution distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described but little is known about the features of covs in wild birds in this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders anseriformes and charadriiformes in sweden collected in 2006/2007 for cov with an overall cov prevalence of 18.7% which is higher than many other wild bird surveys the highest prevalence was found in the diving ducksmainly greater scaup aythya marila 51.5%-and the dabbling duck mallard anas platyrhynchos 19.2%. sequences from two of the greater scaup cov fell into an infrequently detected lineage shared only with a tufted duck aythya fuligula cov coronavirus sequences from mallards in this study were highly similar to cov sequences from the sample species and location in 2011 suggesting long-term maintenance in this population a single black-headed gull represented the only positive sample from the order charadriiformes globally anas species represent the largest fraction of avian cov sequences and there seems to be no host species geographical or temporal structure to better understand the eitiology epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected cov is imperative
meningoencephalitis me is a common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system in dogs clinically me has both infectious and non-infectious causes in the present study a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction mqpcr panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens blastomyces dermatitidis cryptococcus spp neospora caninum borrelia burgdorferi bartonella spp toxoplasma gondii ehrlichia canis and canine distemper virus . the mqpcr panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid csf samples collected from dogs with me the analytic sensitivity i e limit of detection expressed as molecules per 1 l of recombinant vector was 3.8 for cdv 3.7 for ehrlichia canis 3.7 for bartonella spp 3.8 for borrelia burgdorferi 3.7 for blastomyces dermatitidis 3.7 for cryptococcus spp 38 for neospora caninum and 3.7 for toxoplasma gondii among the tested csf samples seven 15% were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency cryptococcus spp 3/7 blastomyces dermatitidis 2/7 and borrelia burgdorferi 2/7 in summary use of an mqpcr panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with me could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes
live attenuated vaccines are critical in the control of avian infectious bronchitis it is necessary to know the protection conferred by commonly used commercial live vaccines in this study specific pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated with the commercial live vaccines h120 4/91 and ldt3-a blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for the detection of ibv-specific antibodies and quantification of cd4 + and cd8 + t lymphocytes at 21 days post-inoculation the vaccinated birds were challenged with the ibv prevalent local strains gx-yl5 gx-gl11079 and gx-nn09032 respectively trachea and kidney samples were collected at 5 days post-challenge for the detection of the virus the results showed that the h120 group exhibited medium antibody levels the lowest percentages of cd4 + cd8 + t lymphocytes and the highest viral loads the 4/91 group showed the lowest antibody levels but the highest percentages of cd4 + cd8 + t lymphocytes and the lowest viral loads the ldt3-a group showed the highest antibody levels the medium percentages of cd4 + cd8 + t lymphocytes and the medium viral loads the protection rates of h120 4/91 and ldt3-a groups were 41.7-58.3% 75.0-83.7% and 66.7-75.0% respectively the present study demonstrated that the vaccines h120 4/91 and ldt3-a could stimulate the immunized chicks to produce different levels of humoral and cellular immunity to resist the infection of ibv but couldn't provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of ibv in southern china also the vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection among the three vaccines avian infectious bronchitis ib an acute highly contagious disease is caused by avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv which results in severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide an increasing number of new serotypes or variants of ibv which were caused by gene mutation and recombination have been identified . vaccination is the main measure for the prevention and control of ib but since there are multiple ibv serotypes and different serotypes of ibvs vaccinations result in incomplete or no cross-protection against the various types of ibv hence it is important to choose suitable vaccines for the control of ibv in the field live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commonly used to control ib at the present time however the effects of inactivated vaccines are uncertain and inactivated vaccines often fail to induce strong cellular immunity . although the live attenuated vaccines can cause virus mutation and recombination they can induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses as well as local immunity . in young birds live attenuated vaccines are especially used to achieve early protection and also to prime future layers and breeders which will be boosted with the inactivated vaccines later . therefore the live attenuated vaccines are of importance in the prevention and control of ib in the field

in keeping with current standards we urge that old smallpox vaccines that were made in animal skin and are still a key part of our strategic national stockpile be tested for adventitious infectious agents the advisory especially applies to viruses that have the potential for zoonotic transmission to human vaccine recipients
viral vaccine vectors have shown to be effective in inducing a robust immune response against the vaccine antigen newcastle disease virus ndv an avian paramyxovirus is a promising vaccine vector against human and veterinary pathogens avirulent ndv strains lasota and b1 have long track records of safety and efficacy therefore use of these strains as vaccine vectors is highly safe in avian and non-avian species ndv replicates efficiently in the respiratory track of the host and induces strong local and systemic immune responses against the foreign antigen as a vaccine vector ndv can accommodate foreign sequences with a good degree of stability and as a rna virus there is limited possibility for recombination with host cell dna using ndv as a vaccine vector in humans offers several advantages over other viral vaccine vectors ndv is safe in humans due to host range restriction and there is no pre-existing antibody to ndv in the human population ndv is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens ndv replicates to high titer in a cell line acceptable for human vaccine development therefore ndv is an attractive vaccine vector for human pathogens for which vaccines are currently not available ndv is also an attractive vaccine vector for animal pathogens
cryptosporidiosis is an infection caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus cryptosporidium which is responsible for a potentially severe disease in new-born ruminants this infection is highly prevalent in small ruminants throughout the world especially in pre-weaned animals the clinical expression is different between goat kids and lambs the infection being generally more severe in the former molecular data demonstrate geographical variations in the species of cryptosporidium infecting small ruminants they also support the possibility of transmission of zoonotic species from these hosts to humans studies are still needed on molecular epidemiology especially in goats and on ways to control infection
pleomorphic virus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter with a fringe of closely applied peplomers 7-9 nm in length were observed by electron microscopy in the stools of 20 children and adults with gastroenteritis in most of the samples no other viral or bacterial pathogens were detected in form and under immune electron microscopy these virus-like particles resembled the breda virus isolated from diarrhoeic calves these objects may be a viral pathogen of humans
pandemics originating from pathogen transmission between animals and humans 10 highlight the broader need to understand how natural hosts have evolved in response to 11 emerging human pathogens and which groups may be susceptible to infection here we 12 investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the host protein bound by sars-cov and 13 sars-cov-2 we find that the ace2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats the group 14 in which the progenitors of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are hypothesized to have evolved 15 particularly in residues that contact sars-cov and sars-cov-2 we detect positive selection 16 in non-bat mammals in ace2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats without 17 enrichment of selection in residues that contact sars-cov or sars-cov-2 additionally we 18 evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact sars-cov or 19 sars-cov-2 revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of 20 predicting spillover events this work increases our understanding of the relationship between 21 mammals particularly bats and coronaviruses and provides data that can be used in functional 22 studies of how host proteins are bound by sars-cov and sars-cov-2 strains 23 24 main 25 the recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the disastrous impacts of zoonotic 26 spillovers and underscores the need to understand how pathogens and hosts evolve in 27 response to one another evolutionary analyses of host proteins targeted by infections reveal 28 the pressures that hosts have faced from pathogens and how they have evolved to resist 29 disease informing predictions about spread of infections and how to counter them the virus 30 sars-cov-2 the causative virus of covid-19 like its close relative sars-cov is thought to 31 have its progenitor origins in bats 1-3 . bats have been suggested to be "special" reservoirs of 32 emerging infectious viruses 4 and of coronaviruses in particular 5 . however often this species-33 rich ecologically diverse clade is treated as a homogenous group represented by one or two 34 3 species particularly when considering the interaction of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with host 35 proteins but see hou et al 6 and demogines et al 7 which consider multiple bat species examination of host proteins bound by potential zoonoses can be used not only to infer 37 past and current evolutionary pressure but to inform the likelihood of cross-species 38 transmission one major barrier to cross-species transmission is the ability of the virus adapted 39 to one host protein to bind another species ' protein 89 . accordingly many studies have 40 examined the ace2 sequence of suspected disease reservoirs to understand how different viral 41 strains bind different species' ace2 and where zoonotic spillover may have originated 6810-12 . 42 these studies especially ones involving functional assays or in-depth modeling of virus-host 43 contacts are usually limited in their comparisons to a small subset of domestic animals or 44 suspected reservoirs e g rhinolophid bats or civets -a suspected intermediate host for sars-cov 13 . often similarity or lack thereof between humans and other species in key ace2
it is important for food animal veterinarians to understand the interaction among animals pathogens and the environment in order to implement herd-specific biosecurity plans animal factors such as the number of immunologically protected individuals influence the number of individuals that a potential pathogen is able to infect as well as the speed of spread through a population pathogens differ in their virulence and contagiousness in addition pathogens have various methods of transmission that impact how they interact with a host population a cattle population's environment includes its housing type animal density air quality and exposure to mud or dust and other health antagonists such as parasites and stress these environmental factors influence the innate immunity of a herd by their impact on immunosuppression in addition a herd's environment also dictates the ''animal flow'' or contact and mixing patterns of potentially infectious and susceptible animals biosecurity is the attempt to keep infectious agents away from a herd state or country and to control the spread of infectious agents within a herd infectious agents bacteria viruses or parasites alone are seldom able to cause disease in cattle without contributing factors from other infectious agents and/or the cattle's environment therefore to develop biosecurity plans for infectious disease in cattle veterinarians must consider the pathogen as well as environmental and animal factors #
the aim of this study was to report two cases of clostridium perfringens type a and clostridium difficile coinfection in adult dogs both animals were positive for a/b toxin toxigenic c difficile and c perfringens type a positive for nete and netf-encoding genes were isolated this report reinforces the necessity of studying a possible synergism of c difficile and c perfringens in enteric disorders
zika virus zikv reemergence poses a significant health threat especially due to its risks to fetal development necessitating safe and effective vaccines that can protect pregnant women zika envelope domain iii ze3 has been identified as a safe and effective vaccine candidate however it is poorly immunogenic we previously showed that plant-made recombinant immune complex ric vaccines are a robust platform to improve the immunogenicity of weak antigens in this study we altered the antigen fusion site on the ric platform to accommodate n-terminal fusion to the igg heavy chain n-ric and thus a wider range of antigens with a resulting 40% improvement in ric expression over the normal c-terminal fusion c-ric both types of rics containing ze3 were efficiently assembled in plants and purified to >95% homogeneity with a simple one-step purification both ze3 rics strongly bound complement receptor c1q and elicited strong ze3-specific antibody titers that correlated with zikv neutralization when either n-ric or c-ric was codelivered with plant-produced hepatitis b core hbc virus-like particles vlp displaying ze3 the combination elicited 5-fold greater antibody titers >1000000 and more strongly neutralized zikv than either rics or vlps alone after only two doses without adjuvant these findings demonstrate that antigens that require a free n-terminus for optimal antigen display can now be used with the ric system and that plant-made rics and vlps are highly effective vaccines targeting ze3 thus the ric platform can be more generally applied to a wider variety of antigens
anaplasma phagocytophilum is the agent of tick-borne fever equine canine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis the common route of a phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite the main vector in europe being ixodes ricinus despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen a phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from europe up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis hga remain rare compared to the worldwide status it is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported epidemiologic studies in europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers hunters veterinarians and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas although the overall genetic diversity of a phagocytophilum in europe is higher than in the usa the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents however the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date most of the european hga cases presented as a mild infection common clinical signs being pyrexia headache myalgia and arthralgia the diagnosis of hga in the usa was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patient's history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests however in europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse the drug of choice for hga is doxycycline and because of potential for serious complication the treatment should be instituted on clinical suspicion alone

background a hepatozoon parasite was initially reported from a cat in india in 1908 and named leucocytozoon felis domestici although domestic feline hepatozoonosis has since been recorded from europe africa asia and america its description classification and pathogenesis have remained vague and the distinction between different species of hepatozoon infecting domestic and wild carnivores has been unclear the aim of this study was to carry out a survey on domestic feline hepatozoonosis and characterize it morphologically and genetically methods hepatozoon sp dna was amplified by pcr from the blood of 55 of 152 36% surveyed cats in israel and from all blood samples of an additional 19 cats detected as parasitemic by microscopy during routine hematologic examinations hepatozoon sp forms were also characterized from tissues of naturally infected cats results dna sequencing determined that all cats were infected with hepatozoon felis except for two infected by hepatozoon canis a significant association p = 0.00001 was found between outdoor access and h felis infection h felis meronts containing merozoites were characterized morphologically from skeletal muscles myocardium and lungs of h felis pcr-positive cat tissues and development from early to mature meront was described distinctly-shaped gamonts were observed and measured from the blood of these h felis infected cats two fetuses from h felis pcr-positive queens were positive by pcr from fetal tissue including the lung and amniotic fluid suggesting possible transplacental transmission genetic analysis indicated that h felis dna sequences from israeli cats clustered together with the h felis spain 1 and spain 2 sequences these cat h felis sequences clustered separately from the feline h canis sequences which grouped with israeli and foreign dog h canis sequences h felis clustered distinctly from hepatozoon spp of other mammals feline hepatozoonosis caused by h felis is mostly sub-clinical as a high proportion of the population is infected with no apparent overt clinical manifestations conclusions this study aimed to integrate new histopathologic hematologic clinical epidemiological and genetic findings on feline hepatozoonosis and promote the understanding of this infection the results indicate that feline infection is primarily caused by a morphologically and genetically distinct species h felis which has predilection to infecting muscular tissues and is highly prevalent in the cat population studied the lack of previous comprehensively integrated data merits the redescription of this parasite elucidating its parasitological characteristics
the importance of the priming of the lung environment by past infections is being increasingly recognized exposure to any given antigen can either improve or worsen the outcome of subsequent lung infections depending on the immunological history of the host thus an ability to impart transient alterations in the lung environment in anticipation of future insult could provide an important novel therapy for emerging infectious diseases in this study we show that nasal administration of virus-like particles vlps before or immediately after lethal challenge with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa of mice i ensures complete recovery from lung infection and near absolute clearance of bacteria within 12 hours of challenge ii reduces host response-induced lung tissue damage iii promotes recruitment and efficient bacterial clearance by neutrophils and cd11c ؉ cells and iv protects macrophages from mrsa-induced necrosis vlp-mediated protection against mrsa relied on innate immunity complete recovery occurred in vlp-dosed mice with severe combined immunodeficiency but not in wild-type mice depleted of either ly6g ؉ or cd11c ؉ cells early il-13 production associated with vlp-induced cd11c ؉ cells was essential for vlp-induced protection these results indicate that vlp-induced alteration of the lung environment protects the host from lethal mrsa pneumonia by enhancing phagocyte recruitment and killing and by reducing inflammation-induced tissue damage via il-13-dependent mechanisms am j pathol 2012 181196 -210 http//dx

this study investigated the seroepidemiology of hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox pteropus conspicillatus population in northern australia near the location of an equine and associated human hendra virus infection in late 2004 the pattern of infection in the population was investigated using a serial cross-sectional serological study over a 25-month period with blood sampled from 521 individuals over six sampling sessions antibody titres to the virus were determined by virus neutralisation test in contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern we observed that seroprevalence gradually increased over the two years suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period our results suggested age pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response antibody titres were significantly higher in females than males with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals temporal variation in antibody titres suggests that herd immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis these findings support an endemic infection pattern of henipaviruses in bat populations suggesting their infection dynamics may differ significantly from the acute self limiting episodic pattern observed with related viruses e g measles virus phocine distemper virus rinderpest virus hence requiring a much smaller critical host population size to sustain the virus these findings help inform predictive modelling of henipavirus infection in bat populations and indicate that the life cycle of the reservoir species should be taken into account when developing risk management strategies for henipaviruses
porcine circovirus 3 pcv-3 is a recently described virus belonging to the family circoviridae it represents the third member of genus circovirus able to infect swine together with pcv-1 considered non-pathogenic and pcv-2 one of the most economically relevant viruses for the swine worldwide industry pcv-3 was originally found by metagenomics analyses in 2015 in tissues of pigs suffering from porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome reproductive failure myocarditis and multisystemic inflammation the lack of other common pathogens as potential infectious agents of these conditions prompted the suspicion that pcv-3 might etiologically be involved in disease occurrence subsequently viral genome was detected in apparently healthy pigs and retrospective studies indicated that pcv-3 was already present in pigs by early 1990s in fact current evidence suggests that pcv-3 is a rather widespread virus worldwide recently the virus dna has also been found in wild boar expanding the scope of infection susceptibility among the suidae family also the potential reservoir role of this species for the domestic pig has been proposed phylogenetic studies with available pcv-3 partial and complete sequences from around the world have revealed high nucleotide identity >96% although two main groups and several subclusters have been described as well moreover it has been proposed the existence of a most common ancestor dated around 50 years ago taking into account the economic importance and the well-known effects of pcv-2 on the swine industry a new member of the same family like pcv-3 should not be neglected studies on epidemiology pathogenesis immunity and diagnosis are guaranteed in the next few years therefore the present review will update the current knowledge and future trends of research on pcv-3
infections with the herpes simplex virus hsv and the human cytomegalovirus hcmv can lead to lifethreatening diseases particularly in immunosuppressed patients furthermore hsv infections at birth herpes neonatorum can result in a disseminated disease associated with a fatal multiorgan failure congenital hcmv infections can result in miscarriage serious birth defects or developmental disabilities antibody-based interventions with hyperimmunoglobulins showed encouraging results in clinical studies but clearly need to be improved the isolation of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is a promising strategy to establish potent therapy options against hsv and hcmv infections monoclonal antibodies are commonly isolated from hybridomas or ebv-immortalized b-cell clones the screening procedure to identify virus-specific cells from a cell mixture is a challenging step since most of the highly neutralizing antibodies target complex conformational epitopes on the virus surface conventional assays such as elisa are based on purified viral proteins and inappropriate to display complex epitopes to overcome this obstacle we have established two full-virus based methods that allow screening for cells and antibodies targeting complex conformational epitopes on viral surface antigens the methods are suitable to detect surface antigen-specific cells from a cell mixture and may facilitate the isolation of highly neutralizing antibodies against hsv and hcmv
serum.-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in semm and colostrum of sows vaccinated during pregnancy with commercially available vaccines against eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus eeev and antibodies were detected in serum from nearly all pigs from vaccinated sows following colostrum uptake serum-virus neutralizing antibody svn test titers were measured in colostmm and pigs at the next farrowing and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated svn titers in serum colostrum and all pigs six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 x lo6 tcid eeev did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 x lo4 tcid while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical eeev related disease after experimental challenge with eeev in addition vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs
background since march 2013 an avian-origin infl uenza a h7n9 virus has caused severe pneumonia in china the aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of this new virus in human beings methods we obtained ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus lung nasopharynx and tonsil and in-vitro cultures of primary human alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages we compared virus tropism and induction of proinfl ammatory cytokine responses of two human infl uenza a h7n9 virus isolates a/shanghai/1/2013 and a/shanghai/2/2013 a highly pathogenic avian infl uenza h5n1 virus the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza h7n7 virus that infected human beings in the netherlands in 2003 the 2009 pandemic infl uenza h1n1 virus and a low pathogenic duck h7n9 virus that was genetically diff erent to the human disease causing a h7n9 viruses a/shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did h7n7 p=0·0002-0·01 both human a h7n9 viruses predominantly infected type ii alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the human lung and replicated to higher titres than did h5n1 p<0·0001 to 0·0078 a/shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did h1n1 p=0·0052-0·05 and h7n7 p=0·0031-0·0151 human h7n9 viruses were less potent inducers of proinfl ammatory cytokines compared with h5n1 virus interpretation collectively the results suggest that the novel h7n9 viruses are better adapted to infect and replicate in the human conducting and lower airways than are other avian infl uenza viruses including h5n1 and pose an important pandemic threat
background infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease which causes tracheal lesions and also affects the reproductive tract and is responsible for large economic losses to the poultry industry every year this is due to both mortality either directly provoked by ibv itself or due to subsequent bacterial infection and lost egg production the virus is difficult to control by vaccination so new methods to curb the impact of the disease need to be sought here we seek to identify genes conferring resistance to this coronavirus which could help in selective breeding programs to rear chickens which do not succumb to the effects of this disease methods whole genome gene expression microarrays were used to analyse the gene expression differences which occur upon infection of birds with infectious bronchitis virus ibv tracheal tissue was examined from control and infected birds at 2 3 and 4 days post-infection in birds known to be either susceptible or resistant to the virus the host innate immune response was evaluated over these 3 days and differences between the susceptible and resistant lines examined results genes and biological pathways involved in the early host response to ibv infection were determined andgene expression differences between susceptible and resistant birds were identified potential candidate genes for resistance to ibv are highlighted conclusions the early host response to ibv is analysed and potential candidate genes for disease resistance are identified these putative resistance genes can be used as targets for future genetic and functional studies to prove a causative link with resistance to ibv
limited information is available on the transmission and spread of influenza virus in pig populations with differing immune statuses in this study we assessed differences in transmission patterns and quantified the spread of a triple reassortant h1n1 influenza virus in naïve and vaccinated pig populations by estimating the reproduction ratio r of infection i e the number of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual using a deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered sir model fitted on experimental data one hundred and ten pigs were distributed in ten isolated rooms as follows i non-vaccinated nv ii vaccinated with a heterologous vaccine he and iii vaccinated with a homologous inactivated vaccine ho the study was run with multiple replicates and for each replicate an infected non-vaccinated pig was placed with 10 contact pigs for two weeks and transmission of influenza evaluated daily by analyzing individual nasal swabs by rt-pcr a statistically significant difference between r estimates was observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs p < 0.05 a statistically significant reduction in transmission was observed in the vaccinated groups where r 95%ci was 1 0.39-2.09 and 0 for the he and the ho groups respectively compared to an r o value of 10.66 6.57-16.46 in nv pigs p < 0.05 transmission in the he group was delayed and variable when compared to the nv group and transmission could not be detected in the ho group results from this study indicate that influenza vaccines can be used to decrease susceptibility to influenza infection and decrease influenza transmission
crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever cchf is a severe tick-borne disease endemic in many countries in africa the middle east eastern europe and asia between 15-70% of reported cases are fatal there is no approved vaccine available and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously in the present study the attenuated poxvirus vector modified vaccinia virus ankara was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the cchf virus glycoproteins cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains including type i interferon receptor knockout mice which are susceptible to cchf disease this vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus even though they did not exhibit clinical signs this is the first demonstration of efficacy of a cchf vaccine
fecal virus shedding seroconversion and histopathology were evaluated in 3-7-year-old gnotobiotic calves orally inoculated with porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov 9.0-9.6 log 10 genomic equivalents of oh-fd22-p5 n=4 or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 10.2-12.5 log 10 ge of pc21a n=3 in pdcov-inoculated calves an acute but persisting fecal viral rna shedding and pdcov-specific serum igg antibody responses were observed but without lesions or clinical disease however no fecal shedding seroconversion histological lesions and clinical disease were detected in pedv-inoculated calves our data indicate that calves are susceptible to infection by the newly emerged pdcov but not by the swine coronavirus pedv
background bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease brd complex the seroprevalence to brsv in norwegian cattle herds is high but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear the aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of brsv and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of brd and to perform phylogenetic analysis of norwegian brsv strains results brsv infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 86% of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent when serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present the number of brsv positive animals in the herd was always higher supporting the view of brsv as the main pathogen sequencing of the g gene of brsv positive samples showed that the current circulating norwegian brsvs belong to genetic subgroup ii along with other north european isolates one isolate from an outbreak in norway in 1976 was also investigated this strain formed a separate branch in subgroup ii clearly different from the current scandinavian sequences the currently circulating brsv could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time the sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the g protein the results demonstrated that brsv is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of brd in norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent the phylogenetic analysis of the norwegian strains of brsv and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of brsv
models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single pathogen in reality many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens we used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the anseriformes ducks and charadriiformes shorebirds this revealed the presence of 27 viral species of which 24 were novel including double-stranded rna viruses picobirnaviridae and reoviridae single-stranded rna viruses astroviridae caliciviridae picornaviridae a retrotranscribing dna virus hepadnaviridae and a single-stranded dna virus parvoviridae these viruses comprise multihost generalist viruses and those that are host-specific indicative of both virome connectivity host sharing and heterogeneity host specificity virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species -avian coronavirus and influenza a virus-and a novel rotavirus species that were shared among some anseriform species while virome heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between anseriformes and charadriiformes as well as differences in viral abundance and alpha diversity among species overall we demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species aggregations
recently outbreaks associated with equine coronavirus ecov have occurred in japan and the united states while ecov is likely to be pathogenic to horses it has not been shown that experimental inoculation of horses with ecov produces clinical signs of disease in this study we inoculated three japanese draft horses with an ecov-positive diarrheic fecal sample to confirm infection after inoculation and to investigate the clinical course and virus shedding patterns of ecov virus neutralization tests showed that all three horses became infected with ecov two of the three horses developed clinical signs similar to those observed during ecov outbreaks including fever anorexia and gastrointestinal dysfunction all horses excreted a large amount of virus into their feces for more than 9 days after inoculation regardless of the presence or absence of clinical signs which suggests that feces are an important source of ecov infection ecov was also detected in nasal swabs from all horses suggesting that respiratory transmission of ecov may occur both symptomatic horses developed viremia while the asymptomatic horse did not white blood cell counts and serum amyloid a concentrations changed relative to the clinical condition of the inoculated horses these may be useful markers for monitoring the clinical status of horses infected with ecov this is the first report of induction of clinical signs of ecov infection in horses by experimental inoculation these clinical and virological findings should aid further investigation of the pathogenesis of ecov
the type ii feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv infection of feline macrophages is enhanced by a monoclonal antibody mab to the s protein of fipv this antibody-dependent enhancement ade activity increased with the mab that showed a neutralizing activity with feline kidney cells suggesting that there was a distinct correlation between ade activity and the neutralizing activity the close association between enhancing and neutralizing epitopes is an obstacle to developing a vaccine containing only neutralizing epitopes without enhancing epitopes in this study we immunized cats with cell lysate with recombinant baculovirus-expressed n protein of the type i fipv strain ku-2 with an adjuvant and investigated its preventive effect on the progression of fip cats immunized with this vaccine produced antibodies against fipv virion-derived n protein but did not produce virus-neutralizing antibodies a delayed type hypersensitivity skin response to n protein was observed in these vaccinated cats showing that cell mediated immunity against the fipv antigen was induced when these vaccinated cats were challenged with a high dose of heterologous fipv the survival rate was 75% 6/8 while the survival rate in the control group immunized with sf-9 cell-derived antigen was 12.5% 1/8 this study showed that immunization with the cell lysate with baculovirus-expressed n protein was effective in preventing the progression of fip without inducing ade of fipv infection in cats
mosquitoes and other arthropods transmit a large number of medically important pathogens in particular viruses these arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses include a wide variety of rna viruses belonging to the flaviviridae family west nile virus wnv usutu virus usuv dengue virus denv japanese encephalitis virus jev zika virus zikv the togaviridae family chikungunya virus chikv and bunyavirales order rift valley fever virus rvfv please refer also to table 9 .1 arboviral transmission to humans and livestock constitutes a major threat to public health and economy as illustrated by the emergence of zikv in the americas rvfv outbreaks in africa and the worldwide outbreaks of denv to answer the question if those viral pathogens also pose a risk to europe we need to first answer the key questions summarized in fig 9 .11 who could contribute to such an outbreak information about mosquito species resident or imported potential hosts and viruses able to infect vectors and hosts in germany is needed 2 where would competent mosquito species meet favorable conditions for transmission information on the minimum requirements for efficient replication of the virus in a given vector species and subsequent transmission is needed 3 how do viruses and vectors interact to facilitate transmission information on the vector immunity vector physiology vector genetics and vector microbiomes is needed
specified pathogen-free cats were naturally infected with fcov or experimentally infected with fcov type i seroconversion was determined and the course of infection was monitored by measuring the fcov loads in faeces whole blood plasma and/or monocytes tissue samples collected at necropsy were examined for viral load and histopathological changes experimentally infected animals started shedding virus as soon as 2 days after infection they generally displayed the highest viral loads in colon ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes seroconversion occurred 3-4 weeks post infection naturally infected cats were positive for fcov antibodies and monocyteassociated fcov viraemia prior to death at necropsy most animals tested positive for viral shedding and fcov rna was found in spleen mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow both experimentally and naturally infected cats remained clinically healthy pathological findings were restricted to generalized lymphatic hyperplasia these findings demonstrate the presence of systemic fcov infection with high viral loads in the absence of clinical and pathological signs
coronaviruses covs have been documented in almost every species of bat sampled bat covs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range indicative of a long-standing host association despite this the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission host-jumping in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that cov diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution and that covs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct cov species co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than codivergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts notably however an analysis of the cov rna polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species
human rhinoviruses hrvs are the main cause of cold-like illnesses and currently no vaccine or antiviral therapies against hrvs are available to prevent or mitigate hrv infection there are more than 150 antigenically heterogeneous hrv serotypes with ∼90 hrvs belonging to major group species a and b development of small animal models that are susceptible to infection with major group hrvs would be beneficial for vaccine research previously we showed that the cotton rat sigmodon hispidus is semi-permissive to hrv16 major group species hrv-a virus infection replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tracts with measurable pathology mucus production and expression of inflammatory mediators herein we report that intranasal infection of cotton rats with hrv14 major group species hrv-b virus results in isolation of infectious virus from the nose and lung similar to hrv16 intramuscular immunization with live hrv14 induces homologous protection that correlated with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies vaccination and challenge experiments with hrv14 and hrv16 to evaluate the development of cross-protective immunity demonstrate that intramuscular immunization with live hrv16 significantly protects animals against hrv14 challenge determination of the immunological mechanisms involved in heterologous protection and further characterization of infection with other major hrv serotypes in the cotton rat could enhance the robustness of the model to define heterotypic relationships between this diverse group of viruses and thereby increase its potential for development of a multi-serotype hrv vaccine
four 1-to 4-week-old ferret kits were submitted to the diagnostic center for population and animal health at michigan state university for post-mortem examination grossly multiple bowel loops in all ferret kits were distended by mucoid faecal material microscopically there was no evidence of inflammation or notable alteration to the normal mucosal morphology gram-positive coccoid bacteria colonized variable segments of the small intestine these bacteria were identified as staphylococcus delphini by phenotypic and molecular analyses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of staphylococcus enterotoxins was positive and polymerase chain reaction detected the gene for staphylococcus enterotoxin e in the isolates the hypersecretory diarrhoea in these ferret kits may have been associated with colonization of the small intestine by s delphini cultures of which were shown in vitro to be potentially capable of producing enterotoxin e the condition described in these ferrets is similar to 'sticky' kit syndrome in mink
viruses have short replication cycles and produce genomic variants within a host a process that seems to adapt to their specific host and also enable them to infect new hosts the recent emergence of viral genomic variants from the circulating pool within the host population and re-emergence of the old ones are posing serious threat to agriculture animal husbandry and humanity as a whole this review assesses the potential role of genomic and proteomic tools that can monitor not only the course of infection and pathogenesis but also predict the pandemic or zoonotic epidemic potential of a virus in a previously exposed or immunologically naive biological population
wildlife is of paramount significance to welfare of humans in modern era the wild animals are the sources of income food fur micro-organisms and other products besides its role in maintaining ecological balance shrinking habitat diseases and pest prevalence and illegal hunting are the major threats due to which many wild species have become extinct and many are endangered scientific interventions are being used to not only harnessing the potential of wildlife but conserving them through assisted reproduction genomics and public awareness.• wildlife is an essential component of natural ecosystem • wild natural flora and fauna are declining rapidly • biotechnological interventions should be used conserve and increase wild animals
bats provide important ecosystem services as pollinators seed dispersers and/or insect controllers but they have also been found harboring different viruses with zoonotic potential virome studies in bats distributed in asia africa europe and north america have increased dramatically over the past decade whereas information on viruses infecting south american species is scarce we explored the virome of tadarida brasiliensis an insectivorous new world bat species inhabiting a maternity colony in rosario argentina by a metagenomic approach the analysis of five pooled oral/anal swab samples indicated the presence of 43 different taxonomic viral families infecting a wide range of hosts by conventional nucleic acid detection techniques and/or bioinformatics approaches the genomes of two novel viruses were completely covered clustering into the papillomaviridae tadarida brasiliensis papillomavirus type 1 tbrapv1 and genomoviridae tadarida brasiliensis gemykibivirus 1 tbgkyv1 families tbrapv1 is the first papillomavirus type identified in this host and the prototype of a novel genus tbgkyv1 is the first genomovirus reported in new world bats and constitutes a new species within the genus gemykibivirus our findings extend the knowledge about oral/anal viromes of a south american bat species and contribute to understand the evolution and genetic diversity of the novel characterized viruses
the syrian golden hamster mesocricetus auratus is a valuable but under-utilized animal model for studies of human viral pathogens such as bunyaviruses arenaviruses flaviviruses henipaviruses and sars-coronavirus a lack of suitable reagents and specific assays for monitoring host responses has limited the use of this animal model to clinical observations pathology and humoral immune responses the objective of this study was to establish and validate assays to monitor host immune responses in the hamster including important proinflammatory anti-inflammatory and innate immune responses as well as markers of apoptosis cell proliferation cell junction integrity and coagulation commercially available mouse and rat elisa and luminex panels were screened for potential cross-reactivity but were found to be of limited value for studying host responses in hamsters subsequently quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr assays for the detection of 51 immune-related and four internal reference genes were developed to validate the immune-related assays hamsters were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus vsv indiana species or treated with lipopolysaccharide lps and host immune responses were monitored in selected organs ribosomal protein l18 was identified as the most stable internal reference gene in conclusion these new assays will greatly improve the use of the hamster as an important small animal model in infectious disease research published by elsevier b v
diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a catastrophic gastrointestinal disease among suckling piglets with high infectivity morbidity and mortality causing huge economic losses to the pig industry in the present study we investigated the different microbiota from the cecal mucosa and cecal contents between healthy and pedv-infected piglets high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed to explore differences the results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by pedv infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level the abundance of pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases including diarrhea was increased the abundance of fusobacterium was 26.71% and 33.91% in cecal mucosa and contents of pedv-infected group respectively whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. the proportion of proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high 24.67% and 22.79% respectively whereas that in the healthy group was 13.13% and 11.34% in the cecal mucosa and contents respectively additionally the proportion of bacteroidetes in the healthy group 29.89% 37.32% was approximately twice that of the pedv-infected group 15.50% 15.39%. "nitrate reduction" "human pathogens diarrhea" "human pathogens gastroenteritis" "nitrite respiration" and "nitrite ammonification" were the enriched functional annotation terms in the pedv-infected groups porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets our findings suggest that determining the intestinal microbiota might provide a promising method to prevent pedv and open a new avenue for future research
over the past 15 years dna vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and chagas disease we review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of dna vaccines against these diseases many studies have validated the concept of using dna vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models the challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy also genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates
recently canine coronavirus ccov strains with putative recombinant origin with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev were shown to be widespread in europe in this study a killed vaccine against tgev-like ccov strains included in the new subtype ccov-iib was developed through inactivation with betapropiolactone and emulsification with mf59 tm adjuvant safety immunogenicity and efficacy of the developed vaccine were evaluated in vivo five 10-week-old beagle pups were administered three weeks apart two vaccine doses whereas two animals served as unvaccinated controls the vaccine was shown to be safe as no local neither systemic reactions were observed after first and second dose administration serum antibodies against ccov were detected in vaccinates starting from study day 14 by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or 28 by virus neutralisation test subsequent challenge with virulent ccov-iib resulted in the development of mild gastroenteric disease in control pups whereas vaccinates did not display clinical signs faecal shedding of the challenge virus occurred in both treatment groups but vaccinated dogs were found to shed very low viral titres in comparison to controls the developed vaccine may help control the ccov-iib-induced disease and active virus circulation in environments such as kennels and shelters where the pathogenic potential of this virus is greater as a consequence of predisposing factors and concurrent infections

transchromosomic bovines tc-bovines adaptively produce fully human polyclonal immunoglobulin igg antibodies after exposure to immunogenic antigens the national interagency confederation for biological research and collaborators rapidly produced and then evaluated anti-ebola virus igg immunoglobulins collectively termed sab-139 purified from tc-bovine plasma after sequential hyperimmunization with an ebola virus makona isolate glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine sab-139 was characterized by several in vitro production research and clinical level assays using wild-type makona-c05 or recombinant virus/antigens from different ebola virus variants sab-139 potently activates natural killer cells monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has high-binding avidity demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance sab-139 has similar concentrations of galactose-α-13-galactose carbohydrates compared with human-derived intravenous ig and the igg1 subclass antibody is predominant all rhesus macaques infected with ebola virus/h sapiens-tc/gin/2014/makona-c05 and treated with sufficient sab-139 at 1 day n = 6 or 3 days n = 6 postinfection survived versus 0% of controls this study demonstrates that tc-bovines can produce pathogen-specific human ig to prevent and/or treat patients when an emerging infectious disease either threatens to or becomes an epidemic
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infects enterocytes and in nursery pigs results in diarrhea anorexia and reduced performance therefore the objective of this study was to determine how pedv infection influenced growth performance and repartitioning of amino acids and energy in nursery pigs a total of 32 barrows and gilts approximately 1 wk post-wean bw = 8.46 ± 0.50 kg and naïve for pedv were obtained weighed and allotted based on sex and bw to one of two treatments 1 control pedv naïve and 2 pedv-inoculated pedv with eight pens of two pigs each per treatment on day post-inoculation dpi 0 pedv pigs were inoculated via intragastric gavage with pedv isolate usa/iowa/18984/2013 pig and feeder weights were recorded at dpi −7 0 5 and 20 in order to calculate adg adfi and gf eight pigs per treatment were euthanized on dpi 5 and 20 and tissues and blood were collected at dpi 5 all pedv pigs were pcr positive for pedv in feces overall pedv pigs tended p < 0.10 to increase adfi which resulted in reduced p < 0.05 feed efficiency at dpi 5 pedv pigs had reduced p < 0.05 villus height and increased p < 0.05 stem cell proliferation in the jejunum compared with control pigs pigs inoculated with pedv had increased p < 0.05 serum haptoglobin and increased insulin-to-glucose ratios compared with control pigs at dpi 5 markers of muscle proteolysis were not different p > 0.05 between treatments within dpi however at dpi 5 20s proteasome activity was increased p < 0.05 in longissimus dorsi of pedv pigs compared with control pigs liver and jejunum gluconeogenic enzyme activities were not different p > 0.05 between treatments within dpi overall pedv-inoculated pigs did recover the absorptive capacity that was reduced during pedv infection by increasing proliferation of intestinal stem cells however the energy and nutrients needed to recover the epithelium may be originating from available luminal nutrients instead of muscle proteolysis and gluconeogenesis this study provides insight into the effects of an enteric coronavirus on postabsorptive metabolism in nursery pigs
european populations of free-living wildcats have been shown to be exposed to cat viruses luxembourg has a high degree of habitat fragmentation and hybridisation rates between domestic cats and wildcats are high we therefore assessed the seroprevalence of six viruses in 34 serum samples collected between 2001 and 2016 from wildcats in luxembourg the values for feline leukemia virus felv 52.9% and feline coronavirus fcov 47.1% were amongst the highest reported for wildcats we found evidence for the cumulative likelihood of exposure to fcov affecting its seroprevalence routine monitoring of viral agents in this strictly protected species should be considered
adenoviruses are double-strained dna viruses found in a great number of vertebrates 8 including humans in order to understand their transmission dynamics it is crucial even from a 9 human health perspective to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence bats are 10 important reservoirs for adenoviruses and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 western europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting adenoviruses taking into account their phylogenetic relationships across 13 species we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses 15 across bat species contrary to other more stable mating strategies e g harems swarming could 16 hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short alternatively bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the iberian 19 species pipistrellus pygmaeus p kuhlii and nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter 20 males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females due to the 21 immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season as a general trend 22 across species we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different 23 across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with 24 their geographic distances p pygmaeus these results increase our knowledge about the 25 transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses.26 27 28 4 29 author summary 30 adenoviruses are dna viruses with a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans 31 causing ocular respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases here we focus on the prevalence of 32adenoviruses in bats which are known to be natural reservoir of many viruses using the results 33 of recent screenings for prevalence of these viruses in 33 european bat species our aim is to 34 find association between adenoviruses prevalence and biological and behavioral host traits 35 considering the heterogeneity both between and within species in order to have a deeper 36 understanding of mechanisms of viral transmission our results highlight the importance of mating strategy bats species using swarming as mating 38 strategy are less likely to be infected by adenoviruses moreover we found that locality of 39 capture can explain a higher prevalence of adenovirus within species however no general 40 pattern has been found in the analysis at individual level suggesting a strong species specificity 41 and complex viral transmission dynamics 42 43
flying foxes have been considered to be involved in the transmission of serious infectious diseases to humans using questionnaires we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area we surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in west java villages were classified into 3 groups inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1-5 km or 5-10 km away from the reserve's outer border data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics age sex and occupation histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans dogs and other domestic animals and knowledge about infectious diseases mainly rabies in flying foxes we found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food especially during the fruit season in these residential areas flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals especially dogs people who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment such as leather gloves goggles and caps the residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission this situation shows that the population in this region is at a quite high risk for contracting infectious diseases from flying foxes
mucosal vaccination which is shown to elicit systemic and mucosal immune responses serves as a noninvasive and convenient alternative to parenteral administration with stronger capability in combatting diseases at the site of entry the exploration of potent mucosal adjuvants is emerging as a significant area based on the continued necessity to amplify the immune responses to a wide array of antigens that are poorly immunogenic at the mucosal sites as one of the inspirations from the ocean chitosan-based mucosal adjuvants have been developed with unique advantages such as ability of mucosal adhesion distinct trait of opening the junctions to allow the paracellular transport of antigen good tolerability and biocompatibility which guaranteed the great potential in capitalizing on their application in human clinical trials in this review the state of art of chitosan and its derivatives as mucosal adjuvants including thermo-sensitive chitosan system as mucosal adjuvant that were newly developed by author's group was described as well as the clinical application perspective after a brief introduction of mucosal adjuvants chitosan and its derivatives as robust immune potentiator were discussed in detail and depth in regard to the metabolism safety profile mode of actions and preclinical and clinical applications which may shed light on the massive clinical application of chitosan as mucosal adjuvant
background snow leopards panthera uncia are a threatened apex predator scattered across the mountains of central and south asia disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated methods and results between 2008 and 2015 twenty snow leopards in the south gobi desert of mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa microscopic agglutination test mat and nextgeneration sequencing ngs techniques the animals showed no clinical signs of disease however serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected these pathogens included coxiella burnetii 25% prevalence leptospira spp 20% and toxoplasma gondii 20%. ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera bacillus bacteroides campylobacter coxiella rickettsia staphylococcus and streptococcus conclusions the zoonotic pathogens identified in this study in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards but have caused illness in other wild felids therefore surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longerterm disease impacts on this snow leopard population article history
bats are likely natural hosts for a range of zoonotic viruses such as marburg ebola rabies as well as for various corona-and paramyxoviruses in 2009/10 researchers discovered rna of two novel influenza virus subtypes -h17n10 and h18n11in central and south american fruit bats the identification of bats as possible additional reservoir for influenza a viruses raises questions about the role of this mammalian taxon in influenza a virus ecology and possible public health relevance as molecular testing can be limited by a short time window in which the virus is present serological testing provides information about past infections and virus spread in populations after the virus has been cleared this study aimed at screening available sera from 100 free-ranging frugivorous bats eidolon helvum sampled in 2009/10 in ghana for the presence of antibodies against the complete panel of influenza a haemagglutinin ha types ranging from h1 to h18 by means of a protein microarray platform this technique enables simultaneous serological testing against multiple recombinant ha-types in 5μl of serum preliminary results indicate serological evidence against avian influenza subtype h9 in about 30% of the animals screened with low-level cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related subtypes h8 and h12 to our knowledge this is the first report of serological evidence of influenza a viruses other than h17 and h18 in bats as avian influenza subtype h9 is associated with human infections the implications of our findings from a public health context remain to be investigated
farm animals are sources of meat milk and eggs for the humans and animal health ensures the quality and security of these agricultural and sideline products the animal raising conditions in livestock stations and poultry houses play vital roles in both animal health and production one of the major factors affecting raising conditions relative humidity has not received much attention even though it is important for animal husbandry in this review we summarize the impacts of relative humidity on animal health and welfare to draw attention for its importance in the improvement of animal raising conditions in the future
hofmann m and wyler r 1990 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus antibodies in swine sera vet microbiol 21 263-273 an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for detecting serum antibodies to the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus pedv was established by using cell culture-grown pedv as antigen for coating ultracentrifugation through 20 and 45% w/w sucrose cushions proved to be the best antigen purification method examination of 1024 swine sera showed a high specificity and a greater sensitivity of the elisa when compared with indirect immunofluorescence reference sera with high antibody titers to pedv originated from two pigs experimentally infected with pedv three different antigen purification methods and the advantages of the elisa compared with an immunofluorescence test are discussed
sars coronavirus sars-cov administered intranasally and intratracheally to rhesus cynomolgus and african green monkeys agm replicated in the respiratory tract but did not induce illness the titer of serum neutralizing antibodies correlated with the level of virus replication in the respiratory tract agmncynomolgusnrhesus moderate to high titers of sars-cov with associated interstitial pneumonitis were detected in the lungs of agms on day 2 and were resolving by day 4 post-infection following challenge of agms 2 months later virus replication was highly restricted and there was no evidence of enhanced disease these species will be useful for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines but the lack of apparent clinical illness in all three species variability from animal to animal in level of viral replication and rapid clearance of virus and pneumonitis in agms must be taken into account by investigators considering the use of these species in efficacy and challenge studies published by elsevier inc
feline panleukopenia fpl a frequently fatal disease of cats is caused by feline parvovirus fpv or canine parvovirus cpv we investigated simultaneous outbreaks of fpl between 2014 and 2018 in australia new zealand and the united arab emirates uae where fpl outbreaks had not been reported for several decades case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved most cats with fpl were shelter-housed 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis unvaccinated had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines analysis of parvoviral vp2 sequence data confirmed that all fpl cases were caused by fpv and not cpv phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct fpv with two virus lineages present in eastern australia and virus movement between different geographical locations viruses from the uae outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin fpv vaccine virus was detected in the new zealand cases highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co-incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter-housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks likely precipitating the multiple re-emergence of infection events
to investigate the potential of rna interference rnai as antiviral agent against rabies two small interfering rnas sirnas targeting rabies virus rabv nucleoprotein n and polymerase l genes were designed and evaluated both sirnas knockdown or silenced the target rabv genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model for efficient delivery adenoviruses expressing the sirnas were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered sirnas was investigated in bhk-21 cells when cells treated with adenoviruses expressing sirnas were challenged with rabv there was 88.35 ± 2.4% and 41.52 ± 9.3% reduction in rabv multiplication in infected cells with sirnas targeting rabv-n and l genes respectively relative quantification of rabv transcripts using real-time pcr revealed knockdown of both rabv-n and l gene transcripts however significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing sirna against rabv-n when mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing sirnas were challenged peripherally with lethal rabv by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing sirnas against rabv-n and l genes respectively these results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing sirna against rabv-n efficiently inhibited the rabv multiplication both in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal rabv challenge this supported the hypothesis that rnai based on sirna targeting rabv-n gene can prevent rabv infection and holds the potential of rnai as an approach to prevent rabies infection
the claim that it is possible to rationally design a structure-based hiv-1 vaccine is based on misconceptions regarding the nature of protein epitopes and of immunological specificity attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an hiv-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation all these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated it is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy what is not possible is to rationally design an hiv-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy an effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response it cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody this means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an hiv-1 vaccine
the robustness of immune responses to an antigen could be dictated by the route of vaccine inoculation traditional smallpox vaccines essentially vaccinia virus strains that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation skin scarification the modified vaccinia virus ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in europe and canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the united states mva is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization since mva is replication-deficient mva and mvavectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular intradermal or subcutaneous routes vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the united states has needle phobia following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the new york city board of health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification we investigated whether mva and mva recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models our data suggest that mva administered by percutaneous inoculation elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation high titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant mva expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein d after scarification similarly a recombinant mva expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rga/viet nam/1203/2004 h5n1 elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification taken together our data suggest that mva and mva-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited
one of the key benefits in using chickens for immunization is the high yield of antibodies obtainable it is known that egg production decreases over time while animal maintenance costs remain stable it would however be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies to identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the costyield ratio we monitored the number of eggs laid the total amount of chicken igy and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period the plant toxin ricin and the clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type a and b were used to immunize 4 chickens the number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen about 80% of the maximum egg number yielding about 20 to 40 g of total igy per hen a stable antibody titer of 1100000 to 11000000 as measured by elisa was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 µg of immobilized native toxin laying capacities were found to decrease on average from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr in parallel the yield of total and specific igy increased over time so that the antibody recovery remained high even after prolonged immunization times using purified igy preparations classical immunological assays such as elisa and western blotting were performed furthermore the igy showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo analysis of the total igy content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation and the antigen-specific titer with a shorter time period of around 7 d circaseptan rhythm in summary we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity igy concentration and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr
simple summary most of the newly emerging infections arise from animal reservoirs frequently represented by wildlife species western european hedgehogs erinaceus europaeus are mammalian hibernators mainly nocturnal and insectivorous living in natural open and green spaces as well as artificial rural and urban areas they are generalist predators of macro-invertebrates but they may also eat meat bird eggs and on occasion pet food these ecological and feeding habits along with their high population densities notable synanthropic attitudes frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species including humans implicate the possibility of intra-and interspecies interactions accounting for the possible involvement of e europaeus in the ecology of several potentially emerging pathogens including coronaviruses using pcr-based and virus isolation methods we found that 58.3% of 24 hedgehogs' fecal samples were pcr-positive for erinaceus coronaviruses ericovs we did not observe any clinical disease related to the ericov infection in hedgehogs however the high mutation rates characterizing members of the coronaviridae family and their potential successful interspecies host jumps-as that likely occurred in the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov emergence-should be considered in the management of hedgehogs admitted to multi-species wildlife rehabilitation centers recommending their return back to the original recovery areas the western european hedgehog erinaceus europaeus is one of the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus erinaceus among them e amurensis is extant in east asia's areas only whereas e europaeus e roumanicus and e concolor are mainly found in europe e europaeus is endemically distributed from western to central and southern europe including italy western european hedgehogs' ecological and feeding habits along with their high population densities notable synanthropic attitudes frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species including humans implicate the possible involvement of e europaeus in the ecology of potentially emerging viruses animals 2020 10 407 2 of 10 such as coronaviruses influenza a and influenza d viruses canine distemper virus pestiviruses and aujeszky's disease virus we examined 24 e europaeus individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of northern italy of the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned pathogens by both pcr-based and virus isolation methods 14 were found pcr-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage c and related to the known erinaceus coronaviruses ericovs as determined by partial sequencing of the virus genome our findings suggest that hedgehogs could be considered natural reservoirs of covs and also act as chronic shedding carriers of these potentially emerging rna viruses
from the perspective of vaccine development it is imperative to accurately diagnose target infections in order to exclude subjects with prior exposure from evaluations of vaccine effectiveness to track incident infection during the course of a clinical trial and to differentiate immune reactions due to natural infections from responses that are vaccine related when vaccine development is accelerated to a rapid pace in response to emerging infectious disease threats the challenges to develop such diagnostic tools is even greater this was observed through the recent expansion of zika virus infections into the western hemisphere in 2014-2017 when initial zika vaccine clinical trials were being designed and launched in response to the outbreak there were no standardized sets of viral and immunological assays and no approved diagnostic tests for zika virus infection the diagnosis of zika virus infection is still an area of active research and development on many fronts here we review emerging infectious disease vaccine clinical assay development and trial execution with a special focus on the state of zika virus clinical assays and diagnostics
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs caused by prrs virus prrsv results in economic losses in the swine industry globally several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of prrs outbreaks thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating prrsv infection in pigs therefore we investigated the in vitro anti-prrsv and antioxidant properties of seven thai medicinal plants caesalpinia sappan linn garcinia mangostana linn houttuynia cordata perilla frutescens clinacanthus nutans phyllanthus emblica and tiliacora triandra results using antiviral screening we observed that t triandra extract strongly inhibited prrsv infectivity in marc-145 cells at 24 h post-infection whereas c sappan extract strongly inhibited prrsv replication at 72 h post-infection c sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration .conclusion t triandra extract could inhibit prrsv infectivity whereas c sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting prrsv replication in marc-145 cells this study elucidates the antiviral activities of thai medicinal plant extracts in vivo the results promise that thai medicinal plant extracts particularly t triandra and c sappan extracts can be developed into pharmaceutical drugs for the prevention of prrs in pigs
infectious bronchitis ib is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry the aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolate irfibv32 793/b serotype in experimentally infected chicken ninetyone-day-old commercial broilers were divided randomly into two groups seventy in the experimental and twenty in the control group chicks in the experimental group were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 eld50/0.1 ml of the virus at three weeks of age the samples from various tissues were collected at1 2 3 5 7 11 13 15 and 20 days postinoculation chickens exhibited mild respiratory signs and depression viral rna was detected in the kidney lung and tracheas on days 1 to 13 pi in the oviduct between days 3 and 13 in testes between days 1 and 11 pi and in the caecal tonsil consistently up to day 20 pi the most remarkable clinical signs and virus detection appeared on day 1 pi data indicated that the number of infected chickens and viral rna detection from tissues was reduced with increasing antibody titer on day 20 pi the results demonstrated that the irfibv32 virus has wide tissue distribution for respiratory urogenital and digestive systems
saffold virus safv a picornavirus is occasionally detected in children with acute flaccid paralysis meningitis and cerebellitis however the neuropathogenicity of safv remains undetermined the virulence of two clinical isolates of safv type 3 safv-3 obtained from a patient with aseptic meningitis am strain and acute upper respiratory inflammation ur strain was analyzed in neonatal and young mice utilizing virological pathological and immunological methods the polyproteins of the strains differed in eight amino acids both clinical isolates were infective exhibited neurotropism and were mildly neurovirulent in neonatal ddy mice both strains pathologically infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells but not large neurons with the ur strain also infecting epithelial cells ur infection resulted in longer inflammation in the brain and spinal cord because of demyelination while the am strain showed more infectivity in the cerebellum in neonatal ddy mice additionally young balb/c mice seroconverted following mucosal inoculation with the ur but not the am strain both safv-3 isolates had neurotropism and mild neurovirulence but showed different cell tropisms in both neonatal and young mouse models this animal model has the potential to recapitulate the potential neuropathogenicity of safv-3
bocv isolated from respiratory tract nasal swab and broncho alveolar washing fluid samples were evaluated for genetic and antigenic differences these bocv from the respiratory tract of healthy and clinically ill cattle with brd signs were compared to reference and vaccine strains based on spike protein coding sequences and vnt using convalescent antisera based on this study the bocv isolates belong to one of two genomic clades clade 1 and 2 which can be differentiated antigenically the respiratory isolates from oklahoma in this study were further divided by genetic differences into three subclades 2a 2b and 2c reference enteric bocv strains and a vaccine strain were in clade 1 currently available vaccines designed to control enteric disease are based on viruses from one clade while viruses isolated from respiratory tracts in this study belong to the other clade
antibody-based interventions against sars-cov-2 could limit morbidity mortality and 26 possibly disrupt epidemic transmission an anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the 27 level of neutralizing antibodies against the sars-cov-2 spike protein yet there is no consensus 28 as to which assay should be used for such measurements using an infectious molecular clone 29 of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv that expresses egfp as a marker of infection we replaced the 30 glycoprotein gene g with the spike protein of sars-cov-2 vsv-egfp-sars-cov-2 and 31 developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2 we also 32 developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 at biosafety 33 level 3 we compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody 34 preparations as well as ace2-fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally 35 high degree of concordance the two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-36 based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies immune γ-globulin or plasma 37 preparations and vaccines against sars-cov-2 replication-competent vsv-egfp-sars-38
an increasing number of insect-specific viruses are found around the world very recently a new group of insectspecific viruses the mesoniviridae family was discovered in africa asia north america and australia here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to mesonivirus genus in senegal west africa the so-called dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country male individuals were also infected supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses as described for other mesoniviruses no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37°c highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in mesonivirus host restriction similar to our study where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health it has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity
vaccination is an efficient way to prevent the occurrence of many infectious diseases in humans to date several viral vectors have been utilized for the generation of vaccines among them baculovirus-categorized as a nonhuman viral vector-has been used in wider applications its versatile features like large cloning capacity nonreplicative nature in mammalian cells and broad tissue tropism hold it at an excellent position among vaccine vectors in addition to ease and safety during swift production recent key improvements to existing baculovirus vectors such as inclusion of hybrid promoters immunostimulatory elements etc have led to significant improvements in immunogenicity and efficacy of surface-displayed antigens furthermore some promising preclinical results have been reported that mirror the scope and practicality of baculovirus as a vaccine vector for human applications in the near future herein this review provides an overview of the induced immune responses by baculovirus surface-displayed vaccines against influenza and other infectious diseases in animal models and highlights the strategies applied to enhance the protective immune responses against the displayed antigens
background immunization with the spike protein s of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-coronavirus cov in mice is known to produce neutralizing antibodies and to prevent the infection caused by sars-cov polyethylenimine 25k pei is a cationic polymer which effectively delivers the plasmid dna results in the present study the immune responses of balb/c mice immunized via intranasal i n route with sars dna vaccine pci-s in a pei/pci-s complex form have been examined the size of the pei/pci-s nanoparticles appeared to be around 194.7 ± 99.3 nm and the expression of the s mrna and protein was confirmed in vitro the mice immunized with i n pei/pci-s nanoparticles produced significantly p < 0.05 higher s-specific igg1 in the sera and mucosal secretory iga in the lung wash than those in mice treated with pci-s alone compared to those in mice challenged with pci-s alone the number of b220 + cells found in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice was elevated co-stimulatory molecules cd80 and cd86 and class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules i-a d were increased on cd11c + dendritic cells in cervical lymph node from the mice after pei/pci-s vaccination the percentage of ifn-γ- tnf-α-and il-2-producing cells were higher in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice than in control mice conclusion these results showed that intranasal immunization with pei/pci-s nanoparticles induce antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses
the nucleocapsid n protein of the infectious bronchitis virus ibv may play an essential role in the replication and translation of viral rna the n protein can also induce high titers of cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immunity which protects chickens from acute infection in this study we generated two monoclonal antibodies mabs designated as 6d10 and 4f10 which were directed against the n protein of ibv using the whole viral particles as immunogens both of the mabs do not cross react with newcastle disease virus ndv infectious laryngotracheitis virus iltv and subtype h9 avian influenza virus aiv after screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning we identified two linear b-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mabs 6d10 and 4f10 which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 242 fgprtk 247 and 195 dliaraaki 203 respectively in the ibv n protein alignments of amino acid sequences from a large number of ibv isolates indicated that the two epitopes especially 242 fgprtk 247 were well conserved among ibv strains this conclusion was further confirmed by the relationships of 18 heterologous sequences to the 2 mabs the novel mabs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for ibv infections
bovine rotavirus brov and bovine coronavirus bcov are major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calve diarrhoea they are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses the diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors we performed postmortem of 45 calves which was below three months of age out of 45 necropscid calves three 6.66% cases were positive for brov and four 8.88% cases were found positive for bcov screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr further rt-pcr positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry ihc in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections three cases of enteritis caused by brov showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria the brov antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes four cases in which bcov was detected grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane histopathologically jejunum showed skipping lesion of micro-abscesses in crypts the bcov antigen distribution was prominent within the necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic micro-abscesses in the colon and ileum it is the first report of brov and bcov antigen demonstration in the jejunum colon ileum peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from india by using ihc
zoonoses in wildlife not only play an important ecological role but pose significant threats to the health of humans domestic animals and some endangered species more than two-thirds of emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases are thought to originate in wildlife despite this co-ordinated surveillance schemes are rare and most efforts at disease control operate at the level of crisis management this review examines the pathways linking zoonoses in wildlife with infection in other hosts using examples from a range of key zoonoses including european bat lyssaviruses and advances in parasitology volume 68
influenza a viruses causes a variety of illnesses in humans the most common infection seasonal influenza is usually a mild self-limited febrile syndrome but it can be more severe in infants the elderly and immunodeficient persons in whom it can progress to severe viral pneumonitis or be complicated by bacterial superinfection leading to pneumonia and sepsis seasonal influenza also occasionally results in neurologic complications rarely viruses that have spread from wild birds to domestic poultry can infect humans such "avian influenza" can range in severity from mild conjunctivitis through the rapidly lethal disease seen in persons infected with the h5n1 virus that first emerged in hong kong in 1997 to develop effective therapies for this wide range of diseases it is essential to have laboratory animal models that replicate the major features of illness in humans this review describes models currently in use for elucidating influenza pathogenesis and evaluating new therapeutic agents
the fi rst reports of astroviruses in animals date back to the end of the 1970s when infections in mammals such as lambs and calves suffering from diarrhea were reported for the fi rst time since then several mammalian species have been shown to be susceptible to astroviruses which appear to be genetically diverse and to have acquired host-speci fi city to date astroviruses have been detected in 16 different orders or species of mammals in addition to humans and signs of infection range from unapparent infection or very mild disease to diarrhea lethargy and anorexia mainly observed in young individuals this chapter describes those astroviruses detected in nonhuman mammalian species worldwide as well as their molecular and phenotypic characteristics and their role in diseases the capacity of these viruses to cross-species barriers and their subsequent adaptation to novel hosts is also highlighted
efforts to develop a broadly protective vaccine against the highly pathogenic avian influenza a hpai h5n1 virus have focused on highly conserved influenza gene products the viral nucleoprotein np and ion channel matrix protein m2 are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza a subtypes here we investigate the relative efficacy of np and m2 compared to ha in protecting against hpai h5n1 virus in mice previous studies have shown that vaccination with np and m2 in recombinant dna and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of ha however we find that the protective efficacy of np and m2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased to explore this question in a model relevant to human disease ferrets were immunized with dna/rad5 vaccines encoding np m2 ha np+m2 or ha+np+m2 only ha or ha+np+m2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge therefore while gene-based vaccination with np and m2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of h5n1 in ferrets these immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with ha which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge this is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons public domain declaration which stipulates that once placed in the public domain this work may be freely reproduced distributed transmitted modified built upon or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose
vaccination is highly effective in preventing various infectious diseases whereas the constant threat of new emerging pathogens necessitates the development of innovative vaccination principles that also confer rapid protection in a case of emergency although increasing evidence points to t cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses here we analyze the immunological mechanisms of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox we found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on cd4 and cd8 t cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva or conventional vaccinia virus of note cd4 t cells were critically required to allow for mva induced cd8 t cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of mva induced protection in contrast selected components of the innate immune system and b cellmediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge in conclusion our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent cd8 t cell immunity plays a key role in mva conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox rapid induction of t cell immunity might serve as a new paradigm for treatments that need to fit into a scenario of protective emergency vaccination
a natural recombinant nephropathogenic k40/09 strain of infectious bronchitis virus ibv was heatadapted for possible future use as live attenuated vaccine the k40/09 strain was selected during successive serial passages in specific-pathogen free spf embryonated eggs at sub-optimal higher temperature 56 • c unlike the parental strain the attenuated strain designated k40/09 hp50 was found to be safe in 1-day-old spf chicks which showed neither mortality nor signs of morbidity and rarely induced ciliostasis or histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular and fine-spray administration k40/09 hp50 provided almost complete protection against two distinct subgroups of a nephropathogenic strain km91-like and qx-like subgroup and elicited the production of high titers of neutralizing antibody neutralization index of 3.6 we conclude that the k40/09 hp50 vaccine virus is rapidly attenuated by heat adaptation and exhibits the desired level of attenuation immunogenicity and protective efficacy required for a live attenuated vaccine these results indicate that the k40/09 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic losses caused by recently emergent nephropathogenic ibv infection in many countries
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has emerged as a highly contagious sometimes fatal disease to find disease-specific b cell epitopes phage-displayed random peptide libraries were panned on serum immunoglobulin ig g antibodies from patients with sars forty-nine immunopositive phage clones that bound specifically to serum from patients with sars were selected these phageborne peptides had 4 consensus motifs of which 2 corresponded to amino acid sequences reported for sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov synthetic peptide binding and competitive-inhibition assays further confirmed that patients with sars generated antibodies against sars-cov immunopositive phage clones and epitope-based peptide antigens demonstrated clinical diagnostic potential by reacting with serum from patients with sars antibody-response kinetics were evaluated in 4 patients with sars and production of igm igg and iga were documented as part of the immune response in conclusion b cell epitopes of sars corresponded to novel coronavirus our epitope-based serologic test may be useful in laboratory detection of the virus and in further study of the pathogenesis of sars
background pigs have been implicated as mixing reservoir for the generation of new pandemic influenza strains control of swine influenza has both veterinary and public health significance unlike human influenza vaccines strains used for commercially available swine influenza vaccines are not regularly replaced making the vaccines provide limited protection against antigenically diverse viruses it is therefore necessary to develop broadly protective swine influenza vaccines that are efficacious to both homologous and heterologous virus infections in this study two forms of dna vaccines were constructed one was made by fusing m2e to consensus h3ha mha which represents the majority of the ha sequences of h3n2 swine influenza viruses another was made by fusing m2e and a conserved ctl epitope np147-155 to consensus h3ha mnha their protective efficacies against homologous and heterologous challenges were tested results balb/c mice were immunized twice by particle-mediated epidermal delivery gene gun with the two dna vaccines it was shown that the two vaccines elicited substantial antibody responses and mnha induced more significant t cell-mediated immune response than mha did then two h3n2 strains representative of different evolutional and antigenic clusters were used to challenge the vaccine-immunized mice homosubtypic challenge results indicated that both of the dna vaccines prevented homosubtypic virus infections completely the vaccines' heterologous protective efficacies were further tested by challenging with a h1n1 swine influenza virus and a reassortant 2009 pandemic strain it was found that mnha reduced the lung viral titers significantly in both challenge groups histopathological observation showed obvious reduction of lung pathogenesis as compared to mha and control groups the combined utility of the consensus ha and the conserved m2e and ctl epitope can confer complete and partial protection against homologous and heterologous challenges respectively in mouse model this may provide a basis for the development of universal swine influenza vaccines
the iberian lynx lynx pardinus is the most endangered felid species in the world lynx populations have decreased dramatically in size and distribution in the last four decades thus becoming increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic events such as epizooties from 1989 to 2000 serum samples were obtained from 48 free-ranging lynx captured in the doñana national park dnp n=31 and mountains of sierra morena sm n=17 in southern spain samples were tested for antibodies against toxoplasma gondii feline herpesvirus 1 fhv-1 feline calicivirus fcv feline/canine parvovirus fpv/cpv feline coronavirus feline immunodeficiency virus fiv feline leukaemia virus and canine distemper virus cdv and for felv p27 antigen to document baseline exposure levels antibodies against t gondii were detected in 44% of lynx with a significantly greater prevalence in dnp 61% than in sm 12%. in dnp prevalence was significantly higher in adult 81% than in juvenile and sub-adult 41% lynx but no such difference was observed in sm low prevalences ≤11% of minimally positive titres were found for fhv-1 fcv and fpv/cpv this combined with the lack of evidence for exposure to cdv fiv and felv suggests that these lynx populations are naïve and might be vulnerable to a disease outbreak in the future because of the reduced size of lynx populations the documented low level of genetic variation particularly in the dnp population coupled with the recently documented state of immune depletion in a majority of necropsied lynx it is important to better understand the threat and potential impact that disease agents might pose for the conservation of this endangered species future surveillance programs must include possible disease reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs and other wild carnivores
the variant strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv severely threaten the pig industry worldwide and cause up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets it is critically important and urgent to develop tools for detection of pedv infection in this study we developed six monoclonal antibodies mabs targeting n protein of pedv and analyzed their applications on enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa western blot assay and flow cytometry assay the results demonstrated that all these six mabs were igg1 isotype and κ chain among these six mabs 3f12 recognizes a linear epitope vaavkdalkslgi while the other five mabs recognize different conformational epitopes formed by a specific peptide fragment or the full length of n protein the functional analysis showed that all these six mabs were applicable to elisa western blot ifa and flow cytometry assay in conclusion we developed six mabs against pedv-n protein to facilitate the early detection of pedv infection using elisa western blot ifa and flow cytometry
diseases caused by bacterial infections in small-scale and industrial livestock are becoming serious global health concern in veterinary science zoonotic bacteria including staphylococcus campylobacter and bartonella species that infect animals and humans cause various illnesses such as fever diarrhea and related complications bacterial diseases in animals can be treated with various classes of antibiotics including fluoroquinolones beta-lactams aminoglycosides and macrolides however the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to drug resistance in infectious agents e g methicillin-resistant staphylococcus this hampers the treatment of infections in livestock and such problems are increasing worldwide dietary phytochemicals and herbal medicines are useful and viable alternatives to pharmaceuticals because they are economical effective non-resistance-forming renewable and environmentally friendly they are small molecules with high structural diversity that cause selective stress to or stimulation of resident microbiota consequently causing an abundance of such microorganisms thus they can be used in preventing various diseases ranging from metabolic and inflammatory diseases to cancer in addition the antioxidant effects of phytochemicals prevent substantial losses in the livestock industry by increasing animal fertility and preventing diseases potentially effective plant extracts could be used in combination with antibiotics to decrease the required dose of antibiotics and increase their effectiveness this strategy can help avoid the side effects of chemical antimicrobials and allow the effective use of phytochemicals for treating diseases furthermore phytochemicals are considered as potential alternatives to antibiotics because of their economical non-resistance-forming and environmentally friendly properties flavonoids such as resveratrol epigallocatechin gallate and phenols such as galangin puerarin and ursolic acid are proven to be effective as antimicrobial agents this review provides invaluable information about the types of microbial infections in animals and the current knowledge on phytotherapeutic agents classified by their mode of actions it also provides insights into potential strategies for effectively treating animal infections using phytochemicals
vulnerability of respiratory mucosa to invasions of airborne pathogens such as sars-cov mers-cov and avian viruses which sometimes cause a life-threatening epidemic and even pandemic underscores significance of developing a pulmonary vaccine adjuvant-delivery system vads herein 30-nm aluminum nanoparticles ans unlike the mostly used adjuvant alum which is unsuitable for delivering pulmonary vaccines due to side effects proved able to act as a vads fitting inhalation immunization to elicit wide-spread anti-antigen immunity in vitro ans facilitated cellular uptake of their cargos and after pulmonary vaccination induced mouse production of high levels of anti-antigen igg in serum and iga in saliva nasal bronchoalveolar and also vaginal fluids besides ifn-γ and anti-antigen igg2a enriched in immunized mice which meanwhile showed no obvious lung inflammation indicated balanced th1/th2 responses were safely induced these outcomes suggest ans may be an efficient pulmonary vads for defending against pathogens especially the ones invading hosts via respiratory system aluminum nanoparticles can safely induce humoral and cellular immunity at systemic and mucosal level through pulmonary vaccination to contrast the conventional adjuvant alum
12 the current classification of animal viruses primarily relates to the virus molecular world the 13 genomic architecture and the corresponding host-cell infection cycle this virus centered 14 perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus 15 transmission success virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission 16 dynamics and with it the organ system involvement and other macroscopic dimensions of 17 the host environment this study examines the transmission ecology of the world main 18 livestock viruses 36 in total belonging to eleven different families and a mix of rna dna 19 and retroviruses viruses are virtually ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion based on 20 the shifting organ system involvement and associated infection-shedding-transmission 21 dynamics as a next step this ranking is disentangled with the aim to contrast two main host 22 42 equine husbandry as well as to create a distinction among the rna dna and retrovirus in 43 the study the matches among these various virus traits serve to establish the outer-to 44 inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment virus-host interactions and nature of 45 the virus two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge respectively for generalist type 46 outer-body and for specialist inner-body viruses 4 47
newcastle disease virus vectored vaccine hemagglutinin h5n1 highly virulent avian influenza virus a b s t r a c t naturally-occurring attenuated strains of newcastle disease virus ndv are being developed as vaccine vectors for use in poultry and humans however some ndv strains such as beaudette c bc may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic we therefore modified the bc strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the f protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain lasota additionally the bc f and hn proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication these modified bc-derived vectors and the lasota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin ha protein of h5n1 highly pathogenic influenza virus hpaiv in general the modified bc-based vectors expressing ha replicated better than lasota/ha and expressed higher levels of ha protein pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens based on in vitro characterization two of the modified bc vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against h5n1 hpaiv a/vietnam/1203/04 immunization of chickens with rndv vector vaccines followed by challenge with hpaiv demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality however only those chickens immunized with modified bc/ha in which residues 271-330 from the f protein had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the ndv ako strain conferred complete protection against challenge virus shedding our findings suggest that this modified rndv can be used safely as a vaccine vector with enhanced replication expression and protective efficacy in avian species and potentially in humans
purpose receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses a phenomenon known as virus interference test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness the virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction this study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among department of defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status furthermore individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined results we compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 95% confidence interval ci 0.86 1.09 p = 0.60 additionally the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups all controls n = 6120 non-influenza positive controls n = 2880 and pan-negative controls n = 3240 the adjusted ors for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much range 0.46-0.51 conclusions receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus however significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses but also parainfluenza rsv and non-influenza virus coinfections published by elsevier ltd

the distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure also host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens and hostpathogen co-evolution hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens or between pathogens sharing a host to analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens and for the observed patterns of co-infection and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts respectively interestingly the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts the developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens which will help to understand and model the population biology of multihost pathogens
swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov is a newly identified enteric alphacoronavirus that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets in china here we propagated a virulent strain sads-cov/cn/gdwt/ 2017 in vero cells for up to 83 passages four strains of sads-cov/gdwt-p7 -p18 -p48 and -p83 were isolated and characterized sequence alignments showed that these four novel strains exhibited 16 nucleotide mutations and resultant 10 amino acid substitutions in open reading frame 1a/1b spike ns3a envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins furthermore a 58-bp deletion in ns7a/7b was found in p48 and p83 strains which led to the loss of ns7b and 38 amino acid changes of ns7a pig infection studies showed that the p7 strain caused typical watery diarrhea while the p83 strain induced none-to-mild delayed and transient diarrhea this is the first report on cell adaption of a virulent sads-cov strain which gives information on the potential virulence determinants of sads-cov
and tusavirus tuv in 2014 these viruses have been studied exclusively by pcr in stool and detected only in patients with diarrhoea although at low prevalence three genotypes of buv have been identified we detected by in-house eia buv1-3 igg antibodies in 7/228 children 3.1% and 10/180 adults 5.6% whereas tuv igg was found in one child 0.4%. all children and 91% of the adults were finnish yet interestingly 3/6 adults of indian origin were buv-igg positive by competition eia no cross-reactivity between the buvs was detected indicating that the buv genotypes represent distinct serotypes furthermore we analysed by buv qpcr stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis respiratory illness or both and found buv dna in three stools 0.3% and for the first time in a nasal swab 0.1%. this is the first study documenting the presence of buv and tuv antibodies in humans although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in finland our results indicate that buv infections might be widespread in asia the buv-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting pointing to systemic infection in humans the development of modern deep sequencing and metagenomic techniques have facilitated recent discoveries of several novel parvoviruses in various animal species including humans of the novel putative human parvoviruses bufavirus buv and tusavirus tuv are among the newest both of these viruses were originally discovered in the stools of diarrheic children in africa -buv in 2012 in burkina faso and tuv in 2014 in tunisia 12 .parvoviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded dna genome of 4-6 kb encoding only a few proteins the classification of parvoviruses is currently based on the non-structural protein ns1 sequence 3 and both buv and tuv are classified in the protoparvovirus genus in the parvoviridae family human bufaviruses are conserved in the ns1 protein 94-96% similarity at the amino acid aa level 4 and thus belong to one species primate protoparvovirus 1 3 . however the buv capsid proteins vp1 and vp2 share only 71-78% and 64-73% similarities at the aa level respectively generating three genotypes 45 . tusavirus on the other hand has been described only in one child 2 although partial tuv-like sequences have been detected in fur seals in brazil 6 .to date bufavirus has been searched for exclusively in stool samples and it has been detected in diarrheal stools of children and adults in africa europe and asia including burkina faso
hiv-related diarrhoea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hiv infection cytomegalovirus is a well-established cause of diarrhoea but the role of other enteric viruses is less clear and will be discussed here the clinical manifestations disease mechanisms diagnostic techniques and current treatments for the management of these infections are reviewed
taxonomic classification for the coronaviridae can be challenging due to the wide host tropism 30 and highly variable genome of the viruses in this family within the alphacoronavirus genus there is a 31 single species alphacoronavirus 1 that encompasses several biologically distinct viruses of distinct animal 32 species here we carried out phylogenetic analysis of members of the alphacoronavirus genus focusing 33 on the viral spike gene which is a primary driver of viral tropism and pathogenesis we identify two 34 distinct clades a and b within the alphacoronavirus 1 species alphacoronavirus 1 clade a 35 encompasses serotype i fcov and ccov and alphacoronavirus 1 clade b encompasses serotype ii 36fcov and ccov and tgev-like viruses we propose this clade designation along with the newly 37proposed alphacoronavirus 2 species as an improved way to classify the diverse alphacoronavirus 38 genus
zoonoses represent a public health risk recently pointed out by the spreading of previously unknown human infectious diseases emerging from animal reservoirs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza caused by h5n1-virus these outbreaks have shown that animal breeding activities can pose a significant public health risk until now the risk of zoonoses has probably been underestimated particularly in occupational settings the emergence or re-emergence of bacterial mycobacterium bovis and brucella spp or viral hepatitis e virus infections shows that zoonoses should be considered as emerging risks in agricultural and animal breeding and should be addressed by specific preventive interventions close cooperation and interaction between veterinarians occupational health physicians and public health operators is necessary for a worldwide strategy to ex pand interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans animals and the environment this is what the one health approach was intended to be
using peptide nanoparticle technology we have designed two novel vaccine constructs representing m2e in monomeric mono-m2e and tetrameric tetra-m2e forms groups of specific pathogen free spf chickens were immunized intramuscularly with mono-m2e or tetra-m2e with and without an adjuvant two weeks after the second boost chickens were challenged with 107.2 eid50 of h5n2 low pathogenicity avian influenza lpai virus m2e-specific antibody responses to each of the vaccine constructs were tested by elisa vaccinated chickens exhibited increased m2e-specific igg responses for each of the constructs as compared to a non-vaccinated group however the vaccine construct tetra-m2e elicited a significantly higher antibody response when it was used with an adjuvant on the other hand virus neutralization assays indicated that immune protection is not by way of neutralizing antibodies the level of protection was evaluated using quantitative real time pcr at 4 6 and 8 days postchallenge with h5n2 lpai by measuring virus shedding from trachea and cloaca the tetra-m2e with adjuvant offered statistically significant p < 0.05 protection against subtype h5n2 lpai by reduction of the ai virus shedding the results suggest that the self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle shows promise as a potential platform for a development of a vaccine against ai
covid-19 has become a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 understanding the origins of sars-cov-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development we show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif rbm in the spike gene and in other genes among bat pangolin and human coronaviruses indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species we also demonstrate that sars-cov-2's entire rbm was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins possibly a critical step in the evolution of sars-cov-2's ability to infect humans similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses
dna vaccines expressing codon-optimized venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev and ebola virus ebov glycoprotein genes provide protective immunity to mice and nonhuman primates when delivered by intramuscular im electroporation ep to achieve equivalent protective efficacy in the absence of ep we evaluated veev and ebov dna vaccines constructed using minimalized nanoplasmid expression vectors that are smaller than conventional plasmids used for dna vaccination these vectors may also be designed to co-express type i interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pwrg7077-based vaccines when delivered by im injection and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes the nanoplasmid veev dna vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol veev challenge as compared to the pwrg7077 veev dna vaccine although all mice receiving the pwrg7077 and nanoplasmid ebov dna vaccines at the dose tested survived ebov challenge only mice receiving the nanoplasmid ebov dna vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge our results suggest that nanoplasmid vectors can improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of alphavirus and filovirus dna vaccines
to develop a diagnostic trial enabling the selective examination for a target cystatin in human body fluids we attempted to prepare monoclonal antibodies against human cystatin sa1 originally cystatin sa and its variant form cystatin sa2 balb/c mice were immunized with recombinant r- cystatins sa1 and sa2 two monoclonal antibodies designated cys3f11 and cys2e5 were selected by elisa analyses the cys2e5 was shown to react with r-cystatin sa2 but also somewhat with r-cystatin sa1 22% cross-reactivity and with plasma cystatin c 18% cross-reactivity indicating a high specificity for cystatin sa2 the cys3f11 reacted not only with r-cystatin sa1 but also with r-cystatin sa2 89% cross-reactivity and plasma cystatin c 47% cross-reactivity this finding was further emphasized by immunoblotting of human submandibular-sublingual saliva samples elisa additivity test suggests that the two monoclonal antibodies bind to distinct epitopes in conclusion we have succeeded in producing two antibodies that discriminate the structural differences between salivary cystatins s and sn which share more than 90% identity in amino acid sequence with cystatin sa
following an immune response two types of differentiated b cells persist in the memory pool plasma cells which confer immediate protection by the secretion of specific antibodies and memory b cells which confer rapid and enhanced response to secondary challenge we will review recent advances in understanding the heterogeneity dynamics and persistence of human memory b cells and plasma cells as well as new methods to isolate human monoclonal antibodies these findings offer new insights into the human b cell response which are relevant for vaccination and therapeutic intervention
minimm-disease md cats raised in a barrier-maintained feline breeding colony routinely become coronavirus cv antibody-positive at 5-8 weeks of age and remain seropositive indefinitely in addition they shed coronavirus-like particles cvlps in their feces which are morphologically distinct from "typical" coronaviruses 0ronasal intraperitoneal intraduodenal and intravenous inoculations of cvlps were uniformly unsuccessful in the seroconversion of eats to cv whereas subsequent prolonged close contact with colony eats did result in seroconversion such evidence indicates that md eats in this barrier colony are infected with at least two non-crossreactive agents 1 feline enteric cvlps which are shed in feces and are morphologically and antigenicmly distinct from established coronaviruses cvs and 2 a virus which is antigenically cross-reactive with cvs but which is apparently shed by some route other than the lower gastrointestinal tract

chikungunya virus chikv is the aetiological agent of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya fever a debilitating arthritic disease that during the past 7 years has caused immeasurable morbidity and some mortality in humans including newborn babies following its emergence and dispersal out of africa to the indian ocean islands and asia since the first reports of its existence in africa in the 1950s more than 1500 scientific publications on the different aspects of the disease and its causative agent have been produced analysis of these publications shows that following a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s and in the absence of autochthonous cases in developed countries the interest of the scientific community remained low however in 2005 chikungunya fever unexpectedly re-emerged in the form of devastating epidemics in and around the indian ocean these outbreaks were associated with mutations in the viral genome that facilitated the replication of the virus in aedes albopictus mosquitoes since then nearly 1000 publications on chikungunya fever have been referenced in the pubmed database this article provides a comprehensive review of chikungunya fever and chikv including clinical data epidemiological reports therapeutic aspects and data relating to animal models for in vivo laboratory studies it includes supplementary tables of all who outbreak bulletins promed mail alerts viral sequences available on genbank and pubmed reports of clinical cases and seroprevalence studies
the ebolaviruses cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever there are five ebolavirus species although much is known about zaire ebolavirus ebov and its neutralization by antibodies little is known about sudan ebolavirus sudv which is emerging with increasing frequency here we describe monoclonal antibodies containing a human framework that potently inhibit infection by sudv and protect mice from lethal challenge the murine antibody 16f6 which binds the sudv envelope glycoprotein gp served as the starting point for design sequence and structural alignment revealed similarities between 16f6 and yads1 a synthetic antibody with a humanized scaffold a focused phage library was constructed and screened to impart 16f6-like recognition properties onto the yads1 scaffold a panel of 17 antibodies were characterized and found to have a range of neutralization potentials against a pseudotype virus infection model neutralization correlated with gp binding as determined by elisa two of these clones e10 and f4 potently inhibited authentic sudv and conferred protection and memory immunity in mice from lethal sudv challenge e10 and f4 were further shown to bind to the same epitope on gp as 16f6 with comparable affinities these antibodies represent strong immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of sudv infection
influenza is often complicated by bacterial pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx and invade the middle ear and/or lung epithelium incidence and pathogenicity of influenza-bacterial coinfections are multifactorial processes that involve various pathogenic virulence factors and host responses with distinct site-and strain-specific differences animal models and kinetic models have improved our understanding of how influenza viruses interact with their bacterial co-pathogens and the accompanying immune responses data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza however further experimental and analytical studies are essential to determining the full mechanistic spectrum of different viral and bacterial strains and species and to finding new ways to prevent and treat influenza-associated bacterial coinfections here we review recent advances regarding transmission and disease potential of influenza-associated bacterial infections and discuss the current gaps in knowledge
transcription regulatory sequences trss play a key role in the synthesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv subgenomic mrnas which resembles similarity-assisted rna recombination in this study genome instability was found when a highly pathogenic prrsv hp-prrsv strain was inserted by an additional transcription unit in which a foreign gene gfp was expressed from trs2 while a copy of trs6 drove orf2a/b transcription structural protein gene-deleted genomes resulted from enhanced rna recombinations were identified in the recombinant virus rhv-gfp moreover rhv-gfp replicated slower than parental viruses and caused less cell death in porcine alveolar macrophages pigs infected with rhv-gfp survived with no or mild syndromes whereas all pigs infected with parental viruses died within 12 days our data showed that additional transcription unit insertion could confer genome instability and attenuation of hp-prrsv
coinfection with two or more pathogens is a common occurrence in respiratory diseases of most species the manner in which multiple pathogens interact is not always straightforward however bordetella bronchiseptica and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv are respiratory pathogens of pigs whose relatives b pertussis and the sars virus cause respiratory disease in humans in an initial experiment the effect of coinfection of prcv and b bronchiseptica was examined in thirty 4week-old pigs 10 pigs/group that were infected with either prcv or b bronchiseptica or both prcv and b bronchiseptica an additional 10 pigs served as sham infected controls five pigs from each group were euthanized at 4 and 10 days postinfection gross and histopathological lung lesions were more severe in the coinfected group as compared to the groups infected with b bronchiseptica or prcv alone in order to investigate the potential role of proinflammatory cytokines in disease severity after coinfection a second experiment was performed to examine cytokine transcription in alveolar macrophages from single and dually infected pigs a total of 48 pigs were divided equally into groups as above but 4 pigs from each group were euthanized at 1 4 and 10 days post-infection coinfected pigs showed a greater and more sustained transcription of proinflammatory cytokines especially il-6 and mcp-1 than pigs infected with either prcv or b bronchiseptica alone thus there appears to be a synergistic effect between prcv and b bronchiseptica with regards to proinflammatory cytokine transcription that may partially explain the increased severity of pneumonia in coinfected pigs published by elsevier b v

little is known about the neutralizing epitopes in turkey coronavirus tcov the spike s protein gene of tcov was divided into 10 fragments to identify the antigenic region containing neutralizing epitopes the expression and antigenicity of s fragments was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody ifa assay using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody or anti-tcov serum polyclonal antibodies raised against expressed s1 amino acid position 1 to 573 from start codon of s protein 4f/4r 482-678 6f/6r 830-1071 or mod4f/epi4r 476-520 s fragment recognized native s1 protein and tcov in the intestines of tcov-infected turkey embryos anti-tcov serum reacted with recombinant 4f/4r 6f/6r and mod4f/epi4r in a western blot the results of a virus neutralization assay indicated that the carboxyl terminal region of the s1 protein mod4f/epi4r or the combined carboxyl terminal s1 and amino terminal s2 protein 4f/ 4r possesses the neutralizing epitopes while the s2 fragment 6f/6r contains antigenic epitopes but not neutralizing epitopes
bats are considered as the reservoirs of several emerging infectious disease and novel viruses are continually found in bats all around the world studies conducted in southern china found that bats carried a variety of viruses however few studies have been conducted on bats in northern china which harbours a diversity of endemic insectivorous bats it is important to understand the prevalence and diversity of viruses circulating in bats in northern china in this study a total of 145 insectivorous bats representing six species were collected from northern china and screened with degenerate primers for viruses belonging to six families including coronaviruses astro viruses hantaviruses paramyxoviruses adenoviruses and circoviruses our study found that four of the viruses screened for were positive and the overall detection rates for astroviruses coronaviruses adenoviruses and circoviruses in bats were 21.4% 15.9% 20% and 37.2% respectively in addition we found that bats in northern china harboured a diversity of novel viruses common serotine eptesicus serotinu fringed long-footed myotis myotis fimriatus and peking myotis myotis pequinius were investigated in china for the first time our study provided new information on the ecology and phylogeny of bat-borne viruses
there is increasing concern about the impact of veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as factors damaging wildlife health especially of threatened avian scavengers feeding upon medicated livestock carcasses we conducted a comprehensive study of failed eggs and dead nestlings in bearded vultures gypaetus barbatus to attempt to elucidate the proximate causes of breeding failure behind the recent decline in productivity in the spanish pyrenees we found high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs primarily fluoroquinolones in most failed eggs and nestlings associated with multiple internal organ damage and livestock pathogens causing disease especially septicaemia by swine pathogens and infectious bursal disease the combined impact of drugs and disease as stochastic factors may result in potentially devastating effects exacerbating an already high risk of extinction and should be considered in current conservation programs for bearded vultures and other scavenger species especially in regards to dangerous veterinary drugs and highly pathogenic poultry viruses
group a rotaviruses are a leading cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea worldwide and prevention of this disease includes vaccination against these viruses in order to highlight the potential selection of rotavirus genotypes due to immune pressure driven by vaccination the aim of this study was to compare group a rotavirus genotypes circulating in french diarrhoeic calves in rotavirus vaccinated herds g6p vaccine with those in non-vaccinated herds during one calving season in 2010 this study showed a high prevalence of rotavirus in both groups with no significant difference between the two no significant differences regarding g p and g/p rotavirus genotype distribution between the two groups were observed with g6 p and g6p genotypes being by far the most prevalent moreover sequence analyses of the vp7 and vp4 partial coding genes of the g6p strains from this study did not allow us to distinguish them according to their origin this study also showed that other pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea such as genogroup iii noroviruses and neboviruses were not more frequently associated with calf diarrhoea in vaccinated herds altogether these results suggest that the studied vaccine did not promote the emergence of rotavirus genotypes or variants different from those of the vaccine or other viruses responsible for calf diarrhoea such as caliciviruses
transmissible gastroenteritis virus was administered orally to cats no clinical disease resulted but infectious virus was isolated from faeces for up to 22 days after infection and serum antibody was detected by neutralisation and immunofluorescence tests .the spread of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev from infected pig herds and the recrudescence of infection after long periods have not been adequately explained experiments on the host range of the virus have indicated that nonporcine hosts could have a role in the epidemiology of tge 2 4 7 8 9 t6 indirect immunofluorescence iif and virus neutralisation v1n tests have been used recently to demonstrate antibody to tgev in cats in holland and great britain samples from cats with clinical feline infectious peritonitis fip frequently have antibody to tgev in the i i f test 10 however neutralising antibody has not been found in sera from dutch cats with fip american and dutch studies have recently demonstrated that sera from cats experimentally infected with f i p will cross-react at low titre with tgev-infected pig cells by immunofluoreseence but will not neutralise tgev in vitro 10 12 . this evidence has been used to suggest that an antigenic relationship exists between tgev and f i p virus the potential of the cat to excrete tgev was studied by virus reisolation and the serological responses to tgev and f i p were monitored thus the possible epidemiological role of the cat in tge could be assessed in addition information was obtained on the possible origin and relationship of vn and i i f antibodies to tgev which occur naturally in cats often at high titres 10 13 tgev strain kn63 used as inoculum in this experiment was prepared as a clarified 50 per cent suspension of small intestine from an infected gnotobiotic piglet i t had a titre of i.7 × 107 pfu/ml
| the respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide the human respiratory tract spans from the nostrils to the lung alveoli and is inhabited by niche-specific communities of bacteria the microbiota of the respiratory tract probably acts as a gatekeeper that provides resistance to colonization by respiratory pathogens the respiratory microbiota might also be involved in the maturation and maintenance of homeostasis of respiratory physiology and immunity the ecological and environmental factors that direct the development of microbial communities in the respiratory tract and how these communities affect respiratory health are the focus of current research concurrently the functions of the microbiome of the upper and lower respiratory tract in the physiology of the human host are being studied in detail in this review we will discuss the epidemiological biological and functional evidence that support the physiological role of the respiratory microbiota in the maintenance of human health m i c r o b i o m e nature reviews | microbiology volume 15 | may 2017 | 259 reviews © 2 0 1 7 m a c m i l l a n p u b l i s h e r s l i m i t e d p a r t o f s p r i n g e r n a t u r e . a l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d . nature reviews | microbiology airways environment air microbiota nasal cavity nasopharynx oropharynx trachea lungs >10 1 7.5 90 40 100 37 10 2 6.3 7.0 7.2 9 90 34 8 150 10 3 10 6 10 3 160 140 25 0.3 45 23 10 -1staphylococcus spp propionibacterium spp corynebacterium spp moraxella spp and streptococcus spp moraxella spp staphylococcus spp corynebacterium spp dolosigranulum spp haemophilus spp and streptococcus spp streptococcus spp rothia spp veillonella spp prevotella spp and leptotrichia spp prevotella spp veillonella spp streptococcus spp and tropheryma whippleinature reviews | microbiology volume 15 | may 2017 | 261 © 2 0 1 7 m a c m i l l a n p u b l i s h e r s l i m i t e d p a r t o f s p r i n g e r n a t u r e . a l l r i g h t s r e s e r v e d .
little is known about the quality of polyclonal antibody responses in covid-19 patients and how it correlates with disease severity or patients' prior exposure to other pathogens the whole polyclonal antibody repertoire in a retrospective cohort of 538 individuals was mapped against sars-cov-2 spike s glycoprotein the main target of antibody immune responses in sars-cov-2 infection bioinformatic predictions identified 15 major b cell epitopes for s of sars-cov-2 several epitopes localised in rbd of s including those spanning the ace2binding site the highly conserved cryptic epitope of the neutralizing antibody of sars-cov and fusion/entry domains of hr1 and hr2 of s protein of sars-cov-2 intriguingly some of these epitopes have cross-reactivity to antigens of common pathogens potentially affecting sars-cov-2 infection outcome high level of anti-spike sars-cov-2 seroreactivity in populations with no history of exposure to sars-cov-2 is of clinical relevance and could underpin better understanding of covid-19 pathophysiology in different populations and provide a blueprint for design of effective vaccines and developing better strategies for antibody testing
2005 bovine chlamydophila spp infection do we underestimate the impact on fertility veterinary research communications 29suppl 1 1^15abstract classical methods for detection of chlamydophila species and of antibodies against these agents have indicated that these bacteria are highly prevalent in cattle and associated with numerous disease conditions these methods demonstrated acute chlamydophila-induced diseases such as epizootic bovine abortion as well as worldwide variable but generally high chlamydophila seroprevalence however it was impossible to consistently detect the low levels of these organisms which were suspected to be present in endemic infections application of highly sensitive real-time pcr and elisa methods for detection of chlamydophila spp dna and of antibodies against chlamydophila spp respectively in a series of prospective cohort studies revealed a high prevalence of chlamydophila spp genital infections in female calves 61% and adult heifers 53%. these infections were acquired by extragenital transmission in the ¢rst weeks of life and infection frequency was increased by crowding of the animals a challenge study demonstrated that infection with c abortus resulted in decreased fertility of heifers the experimental use of a c abortus vaccine provided evidence for immunoprotection against c abortus-induced suppression of bovine fertility the results of these investigations suggest that bovine chlamydophila infection should be viewed more as pervasive low-level infection of cattle than as rare severe disease such infections proceed without apparent disease or with only subtle expressions of disease but potentially have a large impact on bovine herd health and fertility
. adherence and colonization by bacterial pathogens in explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue veterinary research communications 16 2 87-96 explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue taken from virgin heifers were used to examine adherence colonization and cytopathogenesis of streptococcus uberis streptococcus agalactiae streptococcus dysgalactiae staphylococcus aureus and eschen'chia coli in the putative target tissue none of the five bacteria was able to adhere to healthy ductular epithelium but all showed a marked tropism for exposed connective tissue s aureus and e coli induced a marked cytopathic effect in ductular epithelium after 6 hours in culture but the bacteria were not in close association with the affected tissue no evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that adherence to epithelium might be the first stage in the pathogenesis of mastitis caused by these organisms
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov can cause severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans and remains endemic in the middle east since first being identified in 2012 there are currently no approved vaccines or therapies available for mers-cov in this study we evaluated parainfluenza virus 5 piv5-based vaccine expressing the mers-cov envelope spike protein piv5/ mers-s in a human dpp4 knockin c57bl/6 congenic mouse model hdpp4 ki following a single-dose intranasal immunization piv5-mers-s induced neutralizing antibody and robust t cell responses in hdpp4 ki mice a single intranasal administration of 10 4 pfu piv5-mers-s provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted mers-cov mers ma 6.1.2 and improved virus clearance in the lung in comparison single-dose intramuscular immunization with 10 6 pfu uv-inactivated mers ma 6.1.2 mixed with imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice intriguingly an influx of eosinophils was observed only in the lungs of mice immunized with inactivated mers-cov suggestive of a hypersensitivity-type response overall our study indicated that piv5-mers-s is a promising effective vaccine candidate against mers-cov infection importance mers-cov causes lethal infection in humans and there is no vaccine our work demonstrates that piv5 is a promising vector for developing a mers vaccine furthermore success of piv5-based mers vaccine can be employed to develop a vaccine for emerging covs such as sars-cov-2 which causes covid-19
the current frequency of canine parvovirus variants cpv2a cpv2b and cpv2c in the argentine dog population was investigated by pcr amplification of a 583 bp fragment in the vp2 gene from a total of 79 rectal swab samples that have been submitted to our laboratory since 2008 55 69.6% resulted positive and were further analyzed by direct dna sequencing fifty positives samples 91% were characterized as cpv2c variant which appeared in argentina in the year 2003 and has been the prevalent type since 2008 whereas cpv2a and cpv2b still found in argentine dogs were represented in 3.6% and 5.4% of the population respectively considering that cpv2c is spreading worldwide and that this variant is also affecting vaccinated dogs efforts should be made towards the development of new matched cpv vaccines
commercial vaccines for in ovo vaccination have not yet been developed for infectious bronchitis virus ibv the major coronavirus in the poultry industry recombinant ibvs based on the beaudette strain expressing the beaudette spike protein beau-r or that from the virulent m41 strain beaur-m41s were assessed for their potential as prototype vaccines for application to 18-day-old embryos pathogenicity was assessed by observing the effect on hatchability and/or the production of nasal discharge and/or the effects on ciliary activity in the trachea at various time points post hatch in contrast to commercial ibv vaccines given in ovo the beau-r and beaur-m41s strains did not reduce hatchability or cause nasal discharge and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea the presence of the spike protein from a virulent virus did not increase the pathogenicity of the virus according to the criteria used assessment of the beaur-m41s strain for efficacy showed that it protected up to 90% of chicks against challenge with virulent ib virus m41 in a dose dependent manner further egg passage of the beaur-m41s strain beaur-m41s ep10 did not increase its pathogenicity though it did improve its efficacy based on serology and protection against a virulent challenge beaur-m41s ep10 was more efficacious than beaur-m41s protecting more birds against virulent challenge and providing a better serological antibody response beaur-m41s ep10 induced a serological response similar to that of a commercial vaccine given at day-old though the commercial vaccine provided slightly higher efficacy these results are promising for the development of embryo safe efficacious ibv vaccines for in ovo application
analysis of human monoclonal antibodies mabs developed from influenza infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes of influenza virus the ha protein is a crucial target of neutralizing antibodies and at monoclonal level only abs binding to ha have been able to neutralize the virus in this study eight a h1n1pdm 2009 seropositive patients within the age range of 20-50 years median = 36 years were recruited two anti-ha mabs secreting stable clones 2d8 and 2f12 were established under optimized conditions from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of the volunteers these antibodies efficiently neutralized the homologous laboratory isolated strain of the pandemic virus as well as the reference strain our study suggests that the anti-ha antibodies derived from infected indian patients display neutralization potential against the ah1n1pdm 2009 virus this is the first ever study of generation of mabs against the pandemic influenza virus involving the immune repertoire if indian patients molecular characterization of the target regions will help in identifying potential immunogens in the indian pandemic isolates and confer protective immunity against this virus
phase i human clinical studies involving therapeutics for emerging and biodefense pathogens with low incidence such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov requires at a minimum preclinical evaluation of efficacy in two well-characterized and robust animal models thus a ferret sars-cov model was evaluated over a period of 58 days following extensive optimization and characterization of the model in order to validate clinical histopathological virological and immunological endpoints ferrets that were infected intranasally with 10 3 tcid 50 sars-cov showed higher body temperature 2-6 d p i sneezing 5-10 d p i lesions 5-7 d p i and decreased wbc/lymphocytes 2-5 d p i sars-cov was detected up to 7 d p i in various tissues and excreta while neutralizing antibody titers rose at 7 d p i and peaked at 14 d p i at 29 d p i one group was challenged with 10 3 tcid 50 sars-cov and an anamnestic response in neutralizing antibodies was evident with no detectable virus this study supports the validity of the ferret model for use in evaluating efficacy of potential therapeutics to treat sars
our study demonstrated potential mechanisms by which porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection induces greater disease severity of nursing vs weaned conventional pigs twenty-six-day-old weaned and 9-day-old nursing pigs were inoculated orally with pc21a strain or mock mem pigs were monitored for clinical signs and pedv rna titers in feces and serum for pathology and immunofluorescence staining for ki67 marker for crypt proliferation and lgr5 marker for crypt stem cell 3-4 pigs were euthanized at postinoculation days pids 1 3 and 5 severe watery diarrhea and atrophic enteritis with moderate to high pedv rna titers in feces 7.5-12.2 log 10 ge/ml and low viral rna titers in serum 5.6-8.6 log 10 ge/ml were observed in all inoculated nursing piglets at pids 1-5 in contrast weaned pigs did not show evidence of pedv infection at pid 1 pigs exhibited high fecal shedding titers at pids 2-5 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at pids 3-5 indicating a longer incubation for pedv infection while uninoculated or inoculated 27-31-day-old pigs showed large numbers of ki67-or lgr5-positive cells in the intestinal crypts there was a lack of lgr5-positive cells and low proliferation of crypts in jejunum of uninoculated 10-14-day-old piglets possibly causing a slower turnover of enterocytes however the number of lgr5-positive cells and proliferation of intestinal crypts increased remarkably at 3-5 days after inoculation biologic mediators that promote crypt stem cell regeneration would be targets to improve the intestinal epithelium renewal during pedv infection
abstraet--a preliminary study was conducted to compare the regional intestinal immune responses of neonatal calves inoculated with virulent or attenuated bovine coronavirus bcv to determine the cause of reported vaccine failures a group of 9 newborn colostrum-deprived calves was used two calves were inoculated with attenuated virus four calves were infected with virulent virus including one naturally infected calf and three calves were uninfected controls calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of bcv antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus the failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers spiral colon ileum and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct the highest anti-bcv antibody responses were detected in spiral colon the primary site of infection and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins the antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon the immune responses developed slowly in jejunum and were associated primarily with the lgg subtypes
1 the use of vaccines is the main approach to control of the economically important poultry viral respiratory diseases infectious laryngotracheitis ilt avian metapneumovirus ampv infections and infectious bronchitis ib this paper appraises the current methods of vaccine control in the light of the nature of each virus and epidemiological factors associated with each disease 2 infectious laryngotracheitis virus iltv exists as a single type with a wide range of disease severity it is a serious disease in certain regions of the world recent work has distinguished molecular differences between vaccine and field strains and vaccine virus can be a cause of disease vaccines have remained unaltered for many years but new ones are being developed to counter vaccine side effects and reversion and reactivation of latent virus 3 avian metapneumoviruses the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis and respiratory disease in chickens exists as 4 subtypes a b c and d a and b are widespread and vaccines work well provided that accurate doses are given newer vaccine developments are designed to eliminate reversion and possibly counter the appearance of newer field strains which may break through established vaccine coverage 4 ib presents the biggest problem of the three being an unstable rna virus part of the viral genome that codes for the s1 spike gene can undergo mutation and recombination so that important antigenic variants can appear irregularly which may evade existing vaccine protection while conventional vaccines work well against homologous types new strategies are needed to counter this instability molecular approaches involving tailoring viruses to suit field challenges are in progress however the simple use of two genetically different vaccines to protect against a wide range of heterologous types is now a widespread practice that is very effective 5 none of the three diseases described can claim to be satisfactorily controlled and it remains to be seen whether the newer generations of vaccines will be more efficacious and cost effective the importance of constant surveillance is emphasised and the testing of novel vaccines cannot be achieved without the use of vaccine-challenge experiments in poultry
adenoviruses are double-strained dna viruses found in a great number of vertebrates including humans in order to understand their transmission dynamics it is crucial even from a human health perspective to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses and here we use the results of recent screenings in western europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses taking into account their phylogenetic relationships across species we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species contrary to other more stable mating strategies e g harems swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short alternatively bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the iberian species pipistrellus pygmaeus p kuhlii and nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season as a general trend across species we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species p pygmaeus and p kuhlii these results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses plos one | https//doi org/10.1371/journal pone
background the emergence of zika virus zv in tropical and subtropical areas of the world has created an urgent need for vaccines against zv however approved vaccines that prevent zv infection are not available to develop an effective vaccine against zv infection a lipidated form of zv envelope protein domain iii that possesses an intrinsic adjuvant property was rationally designed our goal was to examine the immunogenicity of recombinant lipidated zv envelope protein domain iii rlze3 and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate against zv methods recombinant zv envelope protein domain iii rze3 and rlze3 were prepared with an escherichia colibased system dendritic cell surface marker expression and cytokine production upon stimulation were analyzed to evaluate the function of rlze3 neutralizing antibody capacities were evaluated using focus reduction neutralization tests after immunization to investigate the protective immunity in immunized mice serum samples collected from immunized mice were adoptively transferred into ag129 mice and then viremia levels and survival times were examined after zv challenge results rlze3 alone but not rze3 alone efficiently activated dendritic cells in vitro and was taken up by dendritic cells in vivo immunization of c57bl/6 mice with rlze3 alone without exogenous adjuvant could induce zvspecific neutralizing antibody responses furthermore serum samples obtained from rlze3-immunized mice provided protection as indicated by a reduction in viremia levels and prolongation of survival times after zv challenge conclusion these results indicate that rlze3 is an excellent vaccine candidate and has great potential that should be evaluated in further preclinical studies

a ferret model of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of an adenovirus vaccine animals were subjected to heterologous prime-boost using vectors from human serotype 5 and chimpanzee derived adenoviruses human adhu5 and chimpanzee adc7 expressing spike protein followed by intranasal challenge with sars-cov vaccination led to a substantial reduction in viral load and prevented the severe pneumonia seen in unvaccinated animals the same prime-boost strategy was effective in rhesus macaques in eliciting sars-cov specific immune responses these data indicate that a heterologous adenovirus-based prime-boost vaccine strategy could safely stimulate strong immunity that may be needed for complete protection against sars-cov infection
caliciviridae are human or non-human pathogenic viruses with a high diversity some members of the caliciviridae i e human pathogenic norovirus or rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus rhdv are worldwide emerging pathogens the norovirus is the major cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide accounting for about 85% of the outbreaks in europe between 1995 and 2000 in the united states 25 million cases of infection are reported each year since its emergence in 1984 as an agent of fatal hemorrhagic diseases in rabbits rhdv has killed millions of rabbits and has been dispersed to all of the inhabitable continents in view of their successful and apparently increasing emergence the development of antiviral strategies to control infections due to these viral pathogens has now become an important issue in medicine and veterinary medicine antiviral strategies have to be based on an understanding of the epidemiology transmission clinical symptoms viral replication and immunity to infection resulting from infection by these viruses here we provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying calicivirus infection focusing on the molecular aspects of replication in the host cell recent experimental data generated through an international collaboration on structural biology virology and drug design within the european consortium vizier is also presented based on this analysis we propose antiviral strategies that may significantly impact on the epidemiological characteristics of these highly successful viral pathogens
replication-competent controlled virus vectors were derived from the virulent herpes simplex virus 1 hsv-1 wild-type strain 17synϩ by placing one or two replication-essential genes under the stringent control of a gene switch that is coactivated by heat and an antiprogestin upon activation of the gene switch the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation when administered to mice localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration the immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model unactivated viral vectors-which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines-induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration rear footpads greatly enhanced protective immune responses and a second immunization resulted in complete protection once activated vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and hsv-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors to find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses
since may 2013 outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have devastated the u s swine industry causing immense economic losses two different swine enteric coronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and delta coronavirus have been isolated from the affected swine population the disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the united states and other countries including mexico peru dominican republic canada columbia ecuador and ukraine with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 mrv3 from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources mrv3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states several mrv3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90°c nextgen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the s1 segment to mammalian and bat mrv3 neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection therefore the novel porcine mrv3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses the role of mrv3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the united states remains to be determined but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence we have isolated and characterized two pathogenic reassortant mrv3 isolates from swine fecal samples from porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks and ring-dried swine blood meal in the united states these fecal and blood meal isolates or a chloroform extract of blood meal induced severe diarrhea and mortality in experimentally infected neonatal pigs genetic and phylogenetic analyses of two mrv3 isolates revealed that they are identical but differed significantly from nonpathogenic mammalian orthoreoviruses circulating in the united states the present study provides a platform for immediate development of suitable vaccines and diagnostics to prevent and control porcine orthoreovirus diarrhea x-j elankumaran s 2015 a novel pathogenic mammalian orthoreovirus from diarrheic pigs and swine blood meal in the united states mbio 63e00593-15
involvement of viruses in human neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying pathologic mechanisms remain generally unclear human respiratory coronaviruses hcov can infect neural cells persist in human brain and activate myelin-reactive t cells as a means of understanding the human infection we characterized in vivo the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of hcov-oc43 through the development of an experimental animal model virus inoculation of 21-day postnatal c57bl/6 and balb/c mice led to a generalized infection of the whole cns demonstrating hcov-oc43 neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence this acute infection targeted neurons which underwent vacuolation and degeneration while infected regions presented strong microglial reactivity and inflammatory reactions damage to the cns was not immunologically mediated and microglial reactivity was instead a consequence of direct virus-mediated neuronal injury although this acute encephalitis appears generally similar to that induced by murine coronaviruses an important difference rests in the prominent spongiform-like degeneration that could trigger neuropathology in surviving animals
bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 bvdv-1 is strongly associated with several important diseases of cattle such as bovine respiratory disease diarrhoea and haemoragic lesions to date many subgenotypes have been reported for bvdv-1 currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u while bvdv-1 has a world-wide distribution the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution as an example bvdv-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in north america and europe while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected in contrast bvdv-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in australia despite this uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear the aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of bvdv-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies no overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain consistent with other subgenotypes transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified while thrombocytopenia was not the quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low further studies are required to fully understand the variability and importance of the bvdv-1 subgenotype 1c
the majority of lymphocytes activated at mucosal sites receive instructions to home back to the local mucosa but a portion also seed distal mucosa sites by seeding distal sites with antigen-specific effector or memory lymphocytes the foundation is laid for the animal's mucosal immune system to respond with a secondary response should to this antigen be encountered at this site in the future the common mucosal immune system has been studied quite extensively in rodent models but less so in large animal models such as the pig reasons for this paucity of reported induction of the common mucosal immune system in this species may be that distal mucosal sites were examined but no induction was observed and therefore it was not reported however we suspect that the majority of investigators simply did not sample distal mucosal sites and therefore there is little evidence of immune response induction in the literature it is our hope that more pig immunologists and infectious disease experts who perform mucosal immunizations or inoculations on pigs will sample distal mucosal sites and report their findings whether results are positive or negative in this review we highlight papers that show that immunization/inoculation using one route triggers mucosal immune system induction locally systemically and within at least one distal mucosal site only by understanding whether immunizations at one site triggers immunity throughout the common mucosal immune system can we rationally develop vaccines for the pig and through these works we can gather evidence about the mucosal immune system that may be extrapolated to other livestock species or humans
that are poorly understood in south africa large outbreaks occur in the central interior at long irregular intervals most recently in 2010-2011 however the level of herd immunity of ruminant livestock a key determinant of outbreaks is unknown during 2015-2016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence patterns of and factors associated with antibodies to rvf virus rvfv in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak a rvfv inhibition elisa was used to screen 977 cattle 1549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire the estimated rvfv seroprevalence adjusted for survey design was 42.9% in cattle 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats showing a high degree of farm-level clustering seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs communal land on farms with seasonal pans temporary shallow wetlands and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals seropositivity amongst unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak indicates likely viral circulation during the post-epidemic period the current level of herd immunity in livestock may be insufficient to prevent another large outbreak should suitable conditions recur rift valley fever rvf is an arthropod-borne viral zoonosis caused by rvf virus rvfv a member of the phlebovirus genus family phenuiviridae of the recently established order bunyavirales 1 . rvf is endemic primarily in sub-saharan africa but has crossed several barriers including the sahara to egypt the red sea to the arabian peninsula and the indian ocean to the comoros mayotte and madagascar 2-4 . spread through infected animals and mosquitoes to countries where the disease is not endemic is increasingly possible with more frequent export of livestock from africa to other countries and the presence of known or potentially competent vectors in those countries 45 . rvfv causes sporadic outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality characterized by abortion storms and high mortalities in neonatal sheep cattle and goats 67 . human infection generally occurs concurrently with disease outbreaks in domestic ruminants 258 where humans work or live in close contact with livestock outbreaks tend to occur following above average rainfall and localized flooding 9 . these climatic conditions favour breeding of floodwater mosquitoes that are the proposed maintenance vectors of this virus via transovarial transmission 10 . the floodwater mosquitoes considered to be vectors on the interior plateau of south africa are those in the aedes subgenera ochlerotatus and neomelaniconion 11 . outbreaks may then be amplified by epidemic vectors of which culex theileri is considered the most important on the interior plateau 12 . risk factor studies conducted during and after outbreaks in both humans and animals have identified several other environmental human and animal factors that may be associated with rvf outbreaks and rvfv seropositivity . the presence of large water bodies was found to be associated with seropositivity in somalia 15 and southwest saudi arabia 16 . other environmental factors include vegetation density topography land use drainage 14 temperature 17
because of their large surface area and immunological competence mucosal tissues are attractive administration and target sites for vaccination an important characteristic of mucosal vaccination is its ability to elicit local immune responses which act against infection at the site of pathogen entry however mucosal surfaces are endowed with potent and sophisticated tolerance mechanisms to prevent the immune system from overreacting to the many environmental antigens hence mucosal vaccination may suppress the immune system instead of induce a protective immune response therefore mucosal adjuvants and/or special antigen delivery systems as well as appropriate dosage forms are required in order to develop potent mucosal vaccines whereas oral nasal and pulmonary vaccine delivery strategies have been described extensively the sublingual and buccal routes have received considerably less attention in this review the characteristics of and approaches for sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery are described and compared with other mucosal vaccine delivery sites we discuss recent progress and highlight promising developments in the search for vaccine formulations including adjuvants and suitable dosage forms which are likely critical for designing a successful sublingual or buccal vaccine finally we outline the challenges hurdles to overcome and formulation issues relevant for sublingual or buccal vaccine delivery
background the frequent occurrence of ferret badger-associated human rabies cases in southeast china highlights the lack of laboratory-based surveillance and urges revisiting the potential importance of this animal in rabies transmission to determine if the ferret badgers actually contribute to human and dog rabies cases and the possible origin of the ferret badger-associated rabies in the region an active rabies survey was conducted to determine the frequency of rabies infection and seroprevalence in dogs and ferret badgers methods a retrospective survey on rabies epidemics was performed in zhejiang jiangxi and anhui provinces in southeast china the brain tissues from ferret badgers and dogs were assayed by fluorescent antibody test rabies virus was isolated and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis the sera from ferret badgers and dogs were titrated using rabies virus neutralizing antibodies vna test the ferret badgers presented a higher percentage of rabies seroconversion than dogs did in the endemic region reaching a maximum of 95% in the collected samples nine ferret badger-associated rabies viruses were isolated sequenced and were phylogenetically clustered as a separate group nucleotide sequence revealed 99.4-99.8% homology within the ferret badger isolates and 83-89% homology to the dog isolates in the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes in the same rabies endemic regions conclusions our data suggest ferret badger-associated rabies has likely formed as an independent enzootic originating from dogs during the long-term rabies infestation in southeast china the eventual role of fb rabies in public health remains unclear however management of ferret badger bites rabies awareness and control in the related regions should be an immediate need
background bat trypanosomes have been implicated in the evolutionary history of the t cruzi clade which comprises species from a wide geographic and host range in south america africa and europe including bat-restricted species and the generalist agents of human american trypanosomosis t cruzi and t rangeli methods trypanosomes from bats rhinolophus landeri and hipposideros caffer captured in mozambique southeast africa were isolated by hemoculture barcoding was carried out through the v7v8 region of small subunit ssu rrna and fluorescent fragment length barcoding fflb phylogenetic inferences were based on ssu rrna glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ggapdh and spliced leader sl genes morphological characterization included light scanning and transmission electron microscopy results new trypanosomes from bats clustered together forming a clade basal to a larger assemblage called the t cruzi clade barcoding phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances based on ssu rrna and ggapdh supported these trypanosomes as a new species which we named trypanosoma livingstonei n sp the large and highly polymorphic sl gene repeats of this species showed a copy of the 5s ribosomal rna into the intergenic region unique morphological large and broad blood trypomastigotes compatible to species of the subgenus megatrypanum and cultures showing highly pleomorphic epimastigotes and long and slender trypomastigotes and ultrastructural cytostome and reservosomes features and growth behaviour when co-cultivated with hela cells at 37°c differentiated into trypomastigotes resembling the blood forms and do not invaded the cells complemented the description of this species conclusion phylogenetic inferences supported the hypothesis that trypanosoma livingstonei n sp diverged from a common ancestral bat trypanosome that evolved exclusively in chiroptera or switched at independent opportunities to mammals of several orders forming the clade t cruzi hence providing further support for the bat seeding hypothesis to explain the origin of t cruzi and t rangeli
the impact of respiratory virus infections on the health of children and adults can be very significant yet in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available or provide only limited protection given the widespread prevalence a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza respiratory syncytial virus coronaviruses and rhinoviruses this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge a thorough understanding of the virushost interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges this review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune eva-
porcine enteric coronaviruses covs cause highly contagious enteric diarrhea in suckling piglets these cov infections are characterized by clinical signs of vomiting watery diarrhea dehydration and high morbidity and mortality resulting in significant economic losses and tremendous threats to the pig farming industry worldwide because the clinical manifestations of pigs infected by different covs are similar it is difficult to differentiate between the specific pathogens effective high-throughput detection methods are powerful tools used in the prevention and control of diseases the immune system of piglets is not well developed so serological methods to detect antibodies against these viruses are not suitable for rapid and early detection this paper reviews various pcr-based methods used for the rapid and efficient detection of these pathogenic covs in swine intestines key points 1 swine enteric coronaviruses covs emerged and reemerged in past years 2 enteric covs infect pigs at all ages with high mortality rate in suckling pigs 3 rapid and efficient detection methods are needed and critical for diagnosis
effective antivirals have been developed against specific viruses such as hiv hepatitis c virus and influenza virus this 'one bug-one drug' approach to antiviral drug development can be successful but it may be inadequate for responding to an increasing diversity of viruses that cause significant diseases in humans the majority of viral pathogens that cause emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are membrane-enveloped viruses which require the fusion of viral and cell membranes for virus entry therefore antivirals that target the membrane fusion process represent new paradigms for broad-spectrum antiviral discovery in this review we discuss the mechanisms responsible for the fusion between virus and cell membranes and explore how broadspectrum antivirals target this process to prevent virus entry emerging infectious diseases pose a constant threat to global health and the global economy the vast majority of these diseases are zoonoses that occur when human and environmental factors force the unintended overlap of previously distinct ecological niches this overlap increases the chances for viruses to jump between host species and/or to generate new crossover species in most cases zoonotic viruses being ill adapted to the new human host are highly pathogenic and infections with these viruses lead to rapidly progressing severe diseases with high fatality rates 1 . filoviruses such as ebola virus ebov and marburg virus henipaviruses such as hendra virus and nipah virus niv and coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are the most lethal examples of recent zoonoses 2-5 . in addition viruses in the families arenaviridae such as junin virus and lassa virus bunyaviridae including diverse hantaviruses and rift valley fever virus rvfv and flaviviridae such as dengue virus denv and west nile virus wnv may represent an even greater threat in the future as global climate change increases the geographical range of their animal or arthropod hosts 67 .
multiple vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 based on viral spike protein are under 22 development however there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated 23 following vaccination by these vaccine modalities to better understand antibody response 24 induced by spike protein-based vaccines we immunized rabbits with various sars-cov-2 spike 25 protein antigens s-ectodomain s1+s2 aa 16-1213 which lacks the cytoplasmic and 26 transmembrane domains ct-tm the s1 domain aa 16-685 the receptor-binding domain 27 rbd aa 319-541 and the s2 domain aa 686-1213 as control antibody response was analyzed 28 by elisa surface plasmon resonance spr against different spike proteins in native 29 conformation and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the 30 antibodies elicited by the different spike antigens all three antigens s1+s2 ectodomain s1 31 domain and rbd generated strong neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 vaccination 32 induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by sars-cov-2 spike genome fragment phage 33 display libraries sars-cov-2 gfpdl which identified immunodominant epitopes in the s1 34 s1-rbd and s2 domains furthermore these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the rbd 35 immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike 36 antigens compared with other spike antigens these findings may help guide rational vaccine 37 design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against 38 covid-19 disease.39 40
pneumoviruses have been identified as causative agents in several respiratory disease outbreaks in habituated wild great apes based on phylogenetic evidence transmission from humans is likely however the pathogens have never been detected in the local human population prior to or at the same time as an outbreak here we report the first simultaneous detection of a human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv infection in western lowland gorillas gorilla gorilla gorilla and in the local human population at a field program in the central african republic a total of 15 gorilla and 15 human fecal samples and 80 human throat swabs were tested for hrsv human metapneumovirus and other respiratory viruses we were able to obtain identical sequences for hrsv a from four gorillas and four humans in contrast we did not detect hrsv or any other classic human respiratory virus in gorilla fecal samples in two other outbreaks in the same field program enterovirus sequences were detected but the implication of these viruses in the etiology of these outbreaks remains speculative our findings of hrsv in wild but human-habituated gorillas underline once again the risk of interspecies transmission from humans to endangered great apes
canine distemper virus cdv belongs to the morbillivirus genus of the paramyxoviridae family which causes a threat to the domestic dog and fur-animal industry hemagglutinin protein is a major membrane protein of the vital molecular factor in cdv tropism also known to induce hosts to produce neutralizing antibodies in the current study we prepared two monoclonal antibodies 1a5 and 2b8 against the h protein of the cdv-ps strain a series of partially overlapping synthetic peptides covering the hemagglutinin protein amino acids 50-204 were screened to define the linear epitope identified by 1a5 and 2b8 mabs 120 qktnffnpnrefdfr 134 f8 and 178 argdifppy 186 f14-1 are minimal linear epitopes recognized by 1a5 and 2b8 mabs respectively further investigations revealed that f8 is conserved in different cdv strains however f14-1 contains mutant residues 178 179 and 180 the epitopes f8 and f14-1 localized at the surface of hemagglutinin protein in a three-dimensional 3d structure cdv-infected dog serum can also recognize the identified b-cell epitopes
the aetiological contribution of viral agents in the causation of acute diarrhoea was studied prospecrjvely in 915 infants and young children aged 1-35 months this was a hospital-based study selection being carried out by proportionate random sampling 587 matched controls were also investigated simultaneously methods of detection included direct electron microscopy elisa for rotariruses and tmnimw electron microscopy rotavimses emerged as the single most important cause with highest prevalence in the 6-11-month age group the contribution of other agents was negligible electron microscopy though a 'catch-all' technique is not a cost-effective diagnostic method for developing countries

dengue is a severe emerging arthropod borne viral disease occurring globally around two fifths of the world's population or up to 3.9 billion people are at a risk of dengue infection infection induces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection caused by other serotypes thus there is a need for a vaccine which is capable of providing a life-long protection against all the serotypes of dengue virus in our study comparative genomics of dengue virus denv was conducted to explore potential candidates for novel vaccine targets from our analysis we successfully found 100% conserved epitopes in envelope protein rcptqge ns3 saaqrrgr pgtsgspi ns4a qrtpqdnql ns4b lqakatreaqkra and ns5 proteins qrgsgqv in all denv serotypes some serotype specific conserved motifs were also found in ns1 ns5 capsid prm and envelope proteins using comparative genomics and immunoinformatics approach we could find conserved epitopes which can be explored as peptide vaccine candidates to combat dengue worldwide serotype specific epitopes can also be exploited for rapid diagnostics all ten proteins are explored to find the conserved epitopes in denv serotypes thus making it the most extensively studied viral genome so far
background chikungunya virus chikv is a re-emerging arbovirus associated with febrile illness often accompanied by rash and arthralgia that may persist for several years outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected recent outbreaks have occurred in both europe and the americas suggesting chikv may continue to spread despite the sustained threat of the virus there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against chikv therefore it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective methodology/principal findings in this study we describe the construction and characterization of a modified vaccinia virus ankara mva virus expressing chikv e3 and e2 proteins mva-chik that protected several mouse models from challenge with chikv in particular balb/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with chikv after two doses of mva-chik additionally a129 mice deficient in ifna/b were protected from viremia footpad swelling and mortality while high anti-virus antibodies were elicited low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models however passive transfer of mva-chik immune serum to naïve mice did not protect against mortality suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by mva-chik furthermore depletion of cd4 + but not cd8 + t-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality implicating the indispensable role of cd4 + t-cells in the protection afforded by mva-chik conclusions/significance the results presented herein demonstrate the potential of mva to effectively express chikv e3-e2 proteins and generate protective immune responses our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against chikv and provides a framework for the development of novel more effective vaccine strategies to combat chikv
human viral hepatitis a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide is caused by highly diverse viruses with different genetic ecological and pathogenetic features technological advances that allow throughput sequencing of viral genomes as well as the development of computational tools to analyze such genome data have largely expanded our knowledge on the host range and evolutionary history of human hepatitis viruses thus with the exclusion of hepatitis d virus close or distant relatives of these human pathogens were identified in a number of domestic and wild mammals also sequences of human viral strains isolated from different geographic locations and over different time-spans have allowed the application of phylogeographic and molecular dating approaches to large viral phylogenies in this review we summarize the most recent insights into our understanding of the evolutionary events and ecological contexts that determined the origin and spread of human hepatitis viruses
carrageenan is a clinically proven and marketed compound for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections as infections caused by influenza virus are often accompanied by infections with other respiratory viruses the combination of a specific anti-influenza compound with the broadly active antiviral polymer has huge potential for the treatment of respiratory infections thus the combination of the specific anti-influenza drug zanamivir together with carrageenan in a formulation suitable for intranasal application was evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo we show in-vitro that carrageenan and zanamivir act synergistically against several influenza a virus strains h1n109pdm h3n2 h5n1 h7n7 moreover we demonstrate in a lethal influenza model with a low pathogenic h7n7 virus ha closely related to the avian influenza ah7n9 virus and a h1n109pdm influenza virus in c57bl/6 mice that the combined use of both compounds significantly increases survival of infected animals in comparison with both mono-therapies or placebo remarkably this benefit is maintained even when the treatment starts up to 72 hours post infection a nasal spray containing carrageenan and zanamivir should therefore be tested for prevention and treatment of uncomplicated influenza in clinical trials
bats are reservoir animals harboring many important pathogenic viruses and with the capability of transmitting these to humans and other animals to establish an effective surveillance to monitor transboundary spread of bat viruses between myanmar and china complete organs from the thorax and abdomen from 853 bats of six species from two myanmar counties close to yunnan province china were collected and tested for their virome through metagenomics by solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in total 3742314 reads of 114 bases were generated and over 86% were assembled into 1649512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp of which 26698 2% contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families of the viral contigs 45% 12086/26698 were related to vertebrate viruses 28% 7443/26698 to insect viruses 27% 7074/26698 to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses the metagenomic results were confirmed by pcr of selected viruses in all bat samples followed by phylogenetic analysis which has led to the discovery of some novel bat viruses of the genera mamastrovirus bocavirus circovirus iflavirus and orthohepadnavirus and to their prevalence rates in two bat species in conclusion the present study aims to present the bat virome in myanmar and the results obtained further expand the spectrum of viruses harbored by bats
cattle goats and sheep are dominant livestock species in sub-saharan africa with sometimes limited information on the prevalence of major infectious diseases restrictions due to notifiable epizootics complicate the exchange of samples in surveillance studies and suggest that laboratory capacities should be established domestically bovine coronavirus bcov causes mainly enteric disease in cattle spillover to small ruminants is possible here we established bcov serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle goats and sheep and studied the seroprevalence of bcov in these species in four different locations in the greater accra volta upper east and northern provinces of ghana the whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in kumasi ashanti region of ghana among sampled sheep n = 102 goats n = 66 and cattle n = 1495 the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 % 43.1 % and 55.8 %. for cattle seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms 82.2 % vs 17.8 % comparing farms with > 50 or < 50 animals p = 0.027 highest prevalence was seen in the northern province with dry climate but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected our study identifies a considerable seroprevalence for bcov in ghana and provides further support for the spillover of bcov to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species
live-attenuated vaccines lav represent one of the most important medical innovations in human history in the past three centuries lav have saved hundreds of millions of lives and will continue to do so for many decades to come interestingly the most successful lavs such as the smallpox vaccine the measles vaccine and the yellow fever vaccine have been isolated and/or developed in a purely empirical manner without any understanding of the immunological mechanisms they trigger today the mechanisms governing potent lav immunogenicity and long-term induced protective immunity continue to be elusive and therefore hamper the rational design of innovative vaccine strategies a serious roadblock to understanding lav-induced immunity has been the lack of suitable and cost-effective animal models that can accurately mimic human immune responses in the last two decades human-immune system mice his mice i e mice engrafted with components of the human immune system have been instrumental in investigating the life-cycle and immune responses to multiple human-tropic pathogens however their use in lav research has remained limited here we discuss the strong potential of lavs as tools to enhance our understanding of human immunity and review the past current and future contributions of his mice to this endeavor

bm-bacpak6 dna and the recombinant silkworm baculovirus bm-orf containing the full orf of fmdv was obtained the results of indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa showed that bm-orf could be expressed efficiently in bm-n cell after inoculating the early 5th instar larvae of silkworm the polyprotein of fmdv could be detected by sandwich elisa and empty capsid-like particles could be observed under the electron microscope expression products from silkworm were used as the antigen to immunize the cattle the specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals the immunized cattle were challenged with the virulent fmdv asia i/xj strain two of the four cattle were completely protected and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the others the results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit fmdv vaccine foot-and-mouth disease virus open reading frame silkworm-baculovirus expression system immunogenicity subunit vaccine
antibodies to sars-coronavirus sars-cov-specific b cell epitopes might recognize the pathogen and interrupt its adherence to and penetration of host cells hence these epitopes could be useful for diagnosis and as vaccine constituents using the phage-displayed peptide library screening method and purified fab fragments of immunoglobulin g igg fab from normal human sera and convalescent sera from sars-cov-infected patients as targets 11 b cell epitopes of sars-cov spike glycoprotein s protein and membrane protein m protein were screened after a bioinformatics tool was used to analyze these epitopes four epitope-based s protein dodecapeptides corresponding to the predominant epitopes were chosen for synthesis their antigenic specificities and immunogenicities were studied in vitro and in vivo flow cytometry and elispot analysis of lymphocytes as well as a serologic analysis of antibody showed that these peptides could trigger a rapid highly effective and relatively safe immune response in balb/c mice these findings might aid development of sars diagnostics and vaccines moreover the role of s and m proteins as important surface antigens is confirmed
covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 and has become a global pandemic there is no highly effective medicine or vaccine most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response especially the virus specific igg and igm responses however the igg/ igm responses is barely known to enable the global understanding of sars-cov-2 specific igg/ igm responses a sars-cov-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed the microarray was applied to profile the igg/ igm responses with 29 convalescent sera the results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had igg/ igm responses to sars-cov-2 especially to protein n s1 but not s2 s1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate covid-19 patients from controls besides protein n and s1 significant antibody responses to orf9b and nsp5 were also identified indepth analysis showed that the level of s1 igg positively correlate to age and the level of ldh lactate dehydrogenase especially for women while the level of s1 igg negatively correlate to ly% lymphocyte percentage this study presents the first whole picture of the sars-cov-2 specific igg/ igm responses and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics effective treatment and vaccine.• a sars-cov-2 proteome microarray contains 18 of the 28 predicted proteins • the 1 st global picture of the sars-cov-2 specific igg/ igm response reveals that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients have igg/ igm responses to protein n and s1• significant antibody responses against orf9b and nsp5 were identified • protein s1 specific igg positively correlates to age and ldh while negatively to ly%
the zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses is particularly demonstrated by their broad host range like the highly pathogenic hendra and nipah viruses originating from bats but while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across africa australia south america and asia we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging european bats moreover we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in germany and tested for paramyxovirus rna in parallel to a histo-pathological examination nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus rubulavirus two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with hendra virus our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus-host co-evolution in european bats since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera rubulavirus and jeilongvirus a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other microchiroptera compared to megachiroptera can be assumed given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in europe needs to be considered
