the generation and use of avian antibodies is of increasing interest in a wide variety of applications within the life sciences due to their phylogenetic distance mechanisms of immune diversification and the way in which they deposit igy immunoglobulin in the egg yolk chickens provide a number of advantages compared to mammals as hosts for immunization these advantages include the one-step purification of antibodies from egg yolk in large amounts facilitates having a virtually continuous supply the epitope spectrum of avian antibodies potentially grants access to novel specificities the broad absence of cross-reactivity with mammalian epitopes avoids assay interference and improves the performance of immunological techniques the polyclonal nature of igy antibodies has limited their use since avian hybridoma techniques are not well established recombinant igy however can be generated from mammalian monoclonal antibodies which makes it possible to further exploit the advantageous properties of the igy scaffold moreover cloning and selecting the immune repertoire from avian organisms is highly efficient yielding antigen-specific antibody fragments the recombinant approach is well suited to circumvent any limitations of polyclonal antibodies this review presents comprehensive information on the generation purification modification and applications of polyclonal and monoclonal igy antibodies
this trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv on a subsequent challenge with pasteurella multocidu in pigs sixteen 3-4 week-old piglets from a prrsv and aujeszky disease virus adv free herd were used animals were equally and randomly allocated in four groups which were treated according the following schedule group i negative controls group ii inoculation with only prrsv group iii inoculation with prrsv and p multocida group iv inoculation with adv and p multocidu positive controls prrsv and adv were inoculated intranasally at the doses of 104.'j and 1o'.5 tcidso/ml respectively five days later pigs from groups iii and iv were inoculated intranasally with two ml of a io9 cfu/ml suspension of equal parts of p multocidu strains a52 and a24 no lesions were observed in piglets of group i microscopically interstitial pneumonia was identified in all piglets of groups ii and iii and 3/4 piglets from group iv bronchopneumonia was detected in 3/4 of the piglets from group iii and in all animals of group iv which additionally showed meningo-encephalitis and purulent rhinitis macroscopically only piglets of groups iii and iv had lung consolidation however much lower pneumonic scores 2.3% were observed in group iii where 3 of 4 piglets were affected on the other hand all piglets of group iv showed some degree of pulmonary consolidation with a mean score of 13.7%. based on these results it appears that the role of prrsv as a initiator of secondary diseases is still undefined but is probably mild there was no clear interaction between prrsv and pasteurella multocida under the conditions and strains tested here 0 1997 elsevier science b v
background passive transfer of antibodies not only provides immediate short-term protection against disease but also can be exploited as a therapeutic tool however the 'humanization' of murine monoclonal antibodies mabs is a timeconsuming and expensive process that has the inherent drawback of potentially altering antigenic specificity and/or affinity the immortalization of human b cells represents an alternative for obtaining human mabs but relies on the availability of biological samples from vaccinated individuals or convalescent patients in this work we describe a novel approach to generate fully human mabs by combining a humanized mouse model with a new b cell immortalization technique methodology/principal findings after transplantation with cd34 + cd38 2 human hematopoietic progenitor cells balb/c rag2 2/2 il-2rcc 2/2 mice acquire a human immune system and harbor b cells with a diverse igm repertoire ''human immune system'' mice were then immunized with two commercial vaccine antigens tetanus toxoid and hepatitis b surface antigen sorted human cd19 + cd27 + b cells were retrovirally transduced with the human b cell lymphoma bcl-6 and bcl-xl genes and subsequently cultured in the presence of cd40-ligand and il-21 this procedure allows generating stable b cell receptor-positive b cells that secrete immunoglobulins we recovered stable b cell clones that produced igm specific for tetanus toxoid and the hepatitis b surface antigen respectively conclusion/significance this work provides the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of this novel method based on the immunization of humanized mice for the rapid generation of human mabs against a wide range of antigens
fifty-one specific pathogen-free spf cats 10 weeks to 13 years of age were infected with a cat-to-cat fecaleoral passed strain of feline enteric coronavirus fecv clinical signs ranged from unapparent to a mild and self-limiting diarrhea twenty-nine of these cats were fecv na€ ıve before infection and followed sequentially for fecal virus shedding and antibody responses over a period of 8e48 months fecal shedding as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from rectal swabs appeared within a week and was significantly higher in kittens than older cats fecv shedding remained at high levels for 2e10 months before eventually evolving into one of three excretion patterns eleven cats shed the virus persistently at varying levels over an observation period of 9e24 months eleven cats appeared to have periods of virus shedding interlaced with periods of non-shedding intermittent or recurrent shedders and seven cats ceased shedding after 5e19 months average 12 months there was no change in the patterns of virus shedding among cats that were excreting fecv at the time of a secondary challenge exposure four cats which had ceased shedding re-manifested a primary type infection when secondarily infected cats with higher feline coronavirus fcov antibody titers were significantly more likely to shed virus while cats with lower titers were significantly less likely to be shedding twenty-two kittens born to experimentally infected project queens began shedding virus spontaneously but never before 9e10 weeks of age natural kittenhood infections appeared to be low grade and abortive however a characteristic primary type infection occurred following experimental infection with fecv at 12e15 weeks of age pregnancy parturition and lactation had no influence on fecal shedding by queens methylprednisolone acetate treatment did not induce non-shedders to shed and shedders to increase shedding
swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov a novel coronavirus was first discovered in southern china in january 2017 and caused a large scale outbreak of fatal diarrheal disease in piglets here we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of sads-cov in pigs in china our results suggest that sads-cov has emerged in china at least since august 2016 meanwhile we detected a prevalence of sads-cov 43.53% porcine deltacoronavirus 8.83% porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv 78.25% rotavirus 21.77% and transmissible gastroenteritis virus 0% and we also found the co-infection of sads-cov and pedv occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65%. we screened and obtained two new complete genomes five n and five s genes of sads-cov phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences revealed that all sads-cov sequences in this study clustered with previously reported sads-cov strains to form a well defined branch that grouped with the bat coronavirus hku2strains this study is the first retrospective investigation for sads-cov and provides the epidemiological information of this new virus in china which highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control sads-cov
we examined human leucocyte antigen hla gene polymorphisms in the maonan people from southern china hla-a -b and -drb1 alleles were determined in 108 healthy unrelated maonan individuals by the polymerase chain reaction-luminex method and haplotype frequencies for hla-a -b and -drb1 loci were estimated
anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide yet before population declines are detectable individuals may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed habitats making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather conditions here we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation whether habitat disturbance influences the body mass and immunity of bats we measured and compared body mass chronic stress indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios and the number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with different roost types living in recovering areas actively logged forests and fragmented forests in sabah malaysia in a cave-roosting species chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged areas foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats our study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially related to the roost type we identified foliage-roosting species as particularly sensitive to forest habitat deterioration these species may face a heightened extinction risk in the near future if anthropogenic habitat alterations continue
viruses have caused much mortality and morbidity to humans and pose a serious threat to global public health the virome with the potential of human infection is still far from complete novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics however there is still a lack of methodology for rapidly identifying novel viruses with the potential of human infection this study built several machine learning models to discriminate human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences the k-nearest neighbor knn model can predict the human-infecting viruses with an accuracy of over 90%. the performance of this knn model built on the short contigs ≥1 kb is comparable to those built on the viral genomes we used a reported human blood virome to further validate this knn model with an accuracy of over 80% based on very short raw reads 150 bp our work demonstrates a conceptual and generic protocol for the discovery of novel human-infecting viruses in viral metagenomics studies k e y w o r d s human-infecting virus machine learning viral metagenomics virome s u pp o rti n g i n fo r m ati o n additional supporting information may be found online in the supporting information section at the end of the article how to cite this article zhang z cai z tan z et al rapid identification of human-infecting viruses transbound emerg
mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites with promising results in this work streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria such as lactococcus lactis lactobacillus casei lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus helveticus after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice their ability to induce both systemic igg in serum and mucosal iga in saliva nasal and bronchial washes anti-psaa antibodies was determined immunization with l lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein 150e250 ng per 10 9 cfu however l plantarum ncdo1193 and l helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response iga and igg vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l lactis led to a decrease in s pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments fig 2 expression of psaa in different lab strains a western blot analysis from protein extracts show the constitutive expression of psaa in l lactis l l psaa l casei l c psaa l plantarum l p psaa and l helveticus l h psaa psaa bands are pointed by an arrow lysates from respective control strains carrying the pt1nx empty vector are also shown in the figure b lysates from 10 9 cells of each recombinant lab were loaded onto sds-page and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane concentrations from 40 to 640 ng of rpsaa were used as reference the estimated amounts of psaa are shown below the panel 20 ng for l lactis 200 ng for l casei 150 ng for l plantarum and 250 ng for l helveticus c supernatants recovered after treatment of the different strains with lyzosyme arrows point to the psaa band
host shifts where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases they frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species to 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an rna 20 virus drosophila c virus in 19 different species of drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes we found a strong pattern of parallel evolution where viral lineages from the same host 22were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species when we 23 compared viruses that had evolved in different host species we found that parallel genetic changes 24 were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related this suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species this 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease
recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses covs and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during . we examined the evolutionary relationships between bat covs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus rna-dependent rna polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their covs which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group these shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits this fi nding has implications for the emergence of sars and for the potential future emergence of sars-covs or related viruses november 2002 in southern people's republic of china 1 and a sars coronavirus sars-cov was identifi ed as the etiologic agent 2 these events and the identifi ca-tion of sars-cov in animals associated with the wildlife trade in southern china 3 have led to a rapid resurgence of interest in covs of different origins this resurgence led to discovery of 2 novel human covs 45 identifi cation of sars-like covs in horseshoe bats rhinolophus macrotis r ferrumequinum r pearsoni and r sinicus 67 and identifi cation of other covs in bat species r sinicus r ferrumequinum miniopterus magnater pipistrellus abramus p pipistrellus tylonycteris pachypus myotis ricketti and scotophilus kuhlii 7 9 10 11 12 . however evolutionary relationships among these covs and their bat hosts have not been examined studies in species other than bats have examined hostvirus phylogeny and identifi ed coevolutionary relationships 13-16 or incongruous phylogenetic patterns 17 these fi ndings suggest recent pathogen host shifts defi ned as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species . other studies have demonstrated that the relationship between viral phylogeny and geographic location and identifi cation hosts viral phylogeography can yield information on the origin of emerging zoonoses 19 20 .knowing the high genetic diversity of bat covs we carried out a systematic phylogenetic study of the viruses and their hosts to examine evolutionary relationships between bat covs and bats the aim was to further investigate the origin of sars-like covs and sars our results suggest host-pathogen divergence and host shifts in the recent evolutionary history of these viruses and their hosts we discuss host behavioral traits and viral traits that might have given rise to these patterns and comment on the implications of our fi ndings for the emergence of sars-cov
spleen is one of the important lymphoid organs with wide variations of morphological and physiological functions according to species morphology and function of the spleen in bats which are hosts to several viral strains without exhibiting clinical symptoms remain to be fully elucidated this study aims to examine the spleen morphology of fruit bats associated with their physiological functions spleen histological observations were performed in three fruit bats species cynopterus titthaecheilus n = 9 rousettus leschenaultii n = 3 and pteropus vampyrus n = 3 the spleens of these fruit bats were surrounded by a thin capsule red pulp consisted of splenic cord and wide vascular space filled with blood ellipsoids in all three studied species were found numerously and adjacent to one another forming macrophages aggregates white pulp consisted of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths pals lymphoid follicles and marginal zone the lymphoid follicle contained a germinal centre and a tingible body macrophage that might reflect an active immune system the marginal zone was prominent and well developed this study reports some differences in spleen structure of fruit bats compared to other bat species previously reported and discusses possible physiological implications of the spleen based on its morphology k e y w o r d s flying foxes histology immunology morphology physiology viral reservoir
the diversity and the geographical distribution of swine papillomaviruses pvs are virtually unknown the occurrence and the diversity of swine pv were therefore investigated in pig slurry collected in italy to contribute towards filling this gap in knowledge methods and results twenty-two slurry samples underwent analysis by nested pcr and dna sequencing using published and newly designed specific primer pairs for sus scrofa papillomavirus sspv type 1 and 2 sspv1 and 2 along with degenerate pv-specific primers targeting the major coat protein l1 and the helicase protein e1 overall three samples 13á6% were positive for sspv1 by specific primers and nucleotide nt sequences showed 99-100% nt identity with sspv1 variant a ef395818 while sspv2 was not found in any sample using generic primers eight samples 36á4% were tested positive for human papillomavirus hpv and were characterized as follows b1-hpv8 b1-hpv14 b1-hpv206 b2-hpv113 b2-hpv120 and c1-hpv173 moreover one unclassified c-type was detected conclusions both swine and human pvs were detected in pig slurry in this study the unexpected presence of hpv in pig waste could be explained as the result of an improper use of the sewage collection pits and/or with improper procedures of the operators significance and impact of the study this study reports the first detection of sspv1 in italy along with the first detection of hpvs in pig slurry samples in italy and expands our knowledge about pv diversity and geographic distribution
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv manifestations of the disease are diarrhea vomiting and dehydration starting from the end of 2010 a ped outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern china subsequently the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry accumulating studies demonstrated that new pedv variants that appeared in china were responsible for the ped outbreak in the current mini-review we summarize pedv epidemiology and vaccination in china
background noroviruses and rotaviruses are important viral etiologies of severe gastroenteritis noroviruses are the primary cause of nonbacterial diarrheal outbreaks in humans whilst rotaviruses are a major cause of childhood diarrhea although both enteric pathogens substantially impact human health and economies there are no approved drugs against noroviruses and rotaviruses so far on the other hand whilst the currently licensed rotavirus vaccines have been successfully implemented in over 100 countries the most advanced norovirus vaccine has recently completed phase-i and ii trials we performed a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature on advances in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis results technological advances coupled with a proper understanding of viral morphology and replication over the past decade has facilitated pioneering research on therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis against noroviruses and rotaviruses with promising outcomes in human clinical trials of some of the drugs and vaccines this review focuses on the various developments in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis such as potential antiviral drug molecules passive immunotherapies oral human immunoglobulins egg yolk and bovine colostral antibodies llama-derived nanobodies and antibodies expressed in probiotics plants rice grains and insect larvae immune system modulators probiotics phytochemicals and other biological substances such as bovine milk proteins therapeutic nanoparticles hydrogels and viscogens conventional viral vaccines live and inactivated whole virus vaccines and genetically engineered viral vaccines reassortant viral particles virus-like particles vlps and other subunit recombinant vaccines including multi-valent viral vaccines edible plant vaccines and encapsulated viral particles this review provides important insights into the various approaches to therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis against noroviruses and rotaviruses
conventional vaccines have been extremely successful in preventing infections by pathogens expressing relatively conserved antigens through antibodymediated effector mechanisms thanks to vaccination some diseases have been eradicated and mortality due to infectious diseases has been significantly reduced however there are still many infections that are not preventable with vaccination which represent a major cause of mortality worldwide some of these infections are caused by pathogens with a high degree of antigen variability that cannot be controlled only by antibodies but require a mix of humoral and cellular immune responses novel technologies for antigen discovery expression and formulation allow now for the development of vaccines that can better cope with pathogen diversity and trigger multifunctional immune responses in addition the application of new genomic assays and systems biology approaches in human immunology can help to better identify vaccine correlates of protection the availability of novel vaccine technologies together with the knowledge of the distinct human immune responses that are required to prevent different types of infection should help to rationally design effective vaccines where conventional approaches have failed

after infection of the porcine dam at about 90 days of gestation porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv crosses the placenta and begins to infect fetuses outcomes of include abortion fetal death and respiratory disease in newborn piglets cd163 is the receptor for the virus in this study cd163-positive fetuses recovered between 109 days of gestation or 20 days after maternal infection were completely protected from prrsv in dams possessing a complete knockout of the cd163 receptor the results demonstrate a practical means to eliminate prrsv-associated reproductive disease a major source of economic hardship to agriculture
the antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis tge virus e2 glycoprotein has been defined at three levels antigenic sites antigenic subsites and epitopes four antigenic sites a b c and d were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay ria using monoclonal antibodies mabs selected from 9 fusions about 20% 197 of the hybridomas specific for tge virus produced neutralizing mabs specific for site a which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants site a was differentiated in three antigenic subsites a b and c by characterization of 11 mab resistant mar mutants that were defined by 8 3 and 3 mabs respectively these subsites were further subdivided in epitopes a total of 11 epitopes were defined in e2 glycoprotein eight of which were critical for virus neutralization neutralizing mabs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native denatured or mixtures of native and denatured form all neutralizing mabs reacted to conformational epitopes the antigenic structure of the ezglycoprotein has been defined with murine mabs but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine the natural host of the virus because porcine sera reacted against these sites mabs specific for tge virus site c reacted to non-immune porcine sera this reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins these results indicated that tge virus contains epitopes also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum
a recombinant lactobacillus casei expressing a flagellar antigen from salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis was constructed and evaluated as a mucosal vaccine intragastric immunization of the recombinant strain conferred protective immunity against salmonella infection in mice this immunization did not result in antigen-specific antibody in either feces or sera but induced the release of ifn-␥ on restimulation of primed lymphocytes ex vivo the results suggested that the protective efficacy provided by flagellin-expressing l casei is mainly attributable to cell-mediated immune responses in addition an adjuvant-type effect of the antigen delivery system with l casei was also observed
dengue viruses denv are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses transmitted by aedes spp mosquitoes there are four genetically distinct serotypes designated denv-1 through denv-4 each further subdivided into distinct genotypes the dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype irrespective of virus genotype however this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of denv genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain as dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in denv infection and immunity to better understand genotypic variation in denv-3 neutralization and protection we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic recombinant denv-3 infectious clones each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different denv-3 genotype philippines 1982 genotype i thailand 1995 genotype ii sri lanka 1989 and cuba 2002 genotype iii and puerto rico 1977 genotype iv we used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences denv-polyclonal serum interactions when the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary denv infections neutralization titers varied by as much as 19-fold depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein the observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the e glycoprotein may have significant effects on denv specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination these genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of denv-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization the recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of denv-3 immunopathogenesis

the composition of the porcine virome includes viruses that infect pig cells ancient virus-derived elements including endogenous retroviruses inserted in the pig chromosomes and bacteriophages that infect a broad array of bacteria that inhabit pigs viruses infecting pigs among them viruses also infecting human cells as well as porcine endogenous retroviruses pervs are of importance when evaluating the virus safety of xenotransplantation bacteriophages associated with bacteria mainly in the gut are not relevant in this context xenotransplantation using pig cells tissues or organs is under development in order to alleviate the shortage of human transplants here for the first time published data describing the viromes in different pigs and their relevance for the virus safety of xenotransplantation is analysed in conclusion the analysis of the porcine virome has resulted in numerous new viruses being described although their impact on xenotransplantation is unclear most importantly viruses with known or suspected zoonotic potential were often not detected by next generation sequencing but were revealed by more sensitive methods
infectious agents have been postulated as causes of multiple sclerosis for over a century the possible role of a virus or viruses is supported by data that 1 a childhood exposure is involved and "viral" infections may precipitate exacerbations of disease 2 experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans can cause diseases with long incubation periods remitting and relapsing courses and demyelination and 3 patients with multiple sclerosis have abnormal immune responses to viruses the pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination in postmeasles encephalomyelitis the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system in human immunodeficiency virus-encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins cytokines or neurotoxins these findings m a y have implications on how when and where to seek viruses in multiple sclerosis johnson rt the virology of demyelinating diseases
coronaviruses are closely monitored in the context of emerging diseases and as illustrated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov are known to cross the species barrier and eventually to move from wildlife to humans knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses in wildlife is therefore essential to better understand and prevent emergence events this study explored the presence of coronaviruses in four wild mammal orders in france bats rodents lagomorphs and hedgehogs betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus genera were identified the results obtained suggest the circulation of potentially evolving virus strains with the potential to cross the species barrier
faecal specimens from 797 patients with acute enteritis were examined for the presence of bacterial viral and parasitic agents 209 26.2% enterivic pathogens were identified of whom 118 35.4% in 333 samples from the pediatrics wards bacterial agents were detected in 122 15.3% viruses in 63 7.9% and parasites in 25 3.1% of the 797 specimens lt-producing e coli salmonella and rotavirus were the most frequent pathogens bacterial agents occurred most frequently in t~he summer and autumnal months whereas viruses showed two peaks the first one in summer due to cultivable agents the second in winter to rotavirus mainly
due to novel improved and high-throughput detection methods there is a plethora of newly identified viruses within the genus hantavirus furthermore reservoir host species are increasingly recognized besides representatives of the order rodentia now including members of the mammalian orders soricomorpha/eulipotyphla and chiroptera despite the great interest created by emerging zoonotic viruses there is still a gross lack of in vitro models which reflect the exclusive host adaptation of most zoonotic viruses the usually narrow host range and genetic diversity of hantaviruses make them an exciting candidate for studying virus-host interactions on a cellular level to do so well-characterized reservoir cell lines covering a wide range of bat insectivore and rodent species are essential most currently available cell culture models display a heterologous virus-host relationship and are therefore only of limited value here we review the recently established approaches to generate reservoir-derived cell culture models for the in vitro study of virus-host interactions these successfully used model systems almost exclusively originate from bats and bat-borne viruses other than hantaviruses therefore we propose aviruses 2014 6 952 parallel approach for research on rodent-and insectivore-borne hantaviruses taking the generation of novel rodent and insectivore cell lines from wildlife species into account these cell lines would be also valuable for studies on further rodent-borne viruses such as orthopox-and arenaviruses
a total of 29 faecal samples collected from dogs with diarrhoea following canine parvovirus cpv vaccination were tested by minor groove binder mgb probe assays for discrimination between cpv vaccine and field strains and by diagnostic tests for detection of other canine pathogens fifteen samples tested positive only for cpv field strains however both vaccine and field strains were detected in three samples eleven samples were found to contain only the vaccine strain although eight of them tested positive for other pathogens of dogs only three samples were found to contain the vaccine strain without evidence of canine pathogens the present study confirms that most cases of parvovirus-like disease occurring shortly after vaccination are related to infection with field strains of canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 rather than to reversion to virulence of the modified live virus contained in the vaccine
background the newly emerged influenza ah1n1 virus new h1n1 virus is causing the first influenza pandemic of this century three influenza pandemics of the previous century caused variable mortality which largely depended on the development of severe pneumonia however the ability of the new h1n1 virus to cause pneumonia is poorly understood methods the new h1n1 virus was inoculated intratracheally into ferrets its ability to cause pneumonia was compared with that of seasonal influenza h1n1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 virus by using clinical virological and pathological analyses results our results showed that the new h1n1 virus causes pneumonia in ferrets intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal h1n1 virus and by hpai h5n1 virus the new h1n1 virus replicated well throughout the lower respiratory tract and more extensively than did both seasonal h1n1 virus which replicated mainly in the bronchi and hpai h5n1 virus which replicated mainly in the alveoli high loads of new h1n1 virus in lung tissue were associated with diffuse alveolar damage and mortality conclusions the new h1n1 virus may be intrinsically more pathogenic for humans than is seasonal h1n1 virus a new influenza a virus of the subtype h1n1 new h1n1 virus that first emerged in mexico at the beginning of 2009 is the first pandemic human influenza virus of the 21st century studies have concluded that this virus probably originated from a domestic swine reservoir on the basis of its genetic signature . on 11 june 2009 the world health organization declared phase 6 of the global pandemic alert level .
gram-positive nonpathogenic lactic acid bacteria lab are considered to be promising candidates for the development of novel safe production and delivery systems of heterologous proteins recombinant lab strains were shown to elicit specific systemic and mucosal immune responses against selected antigens for this reason this group of bacteria is considered as a potential replacement of classical often pathogenic attenuated microbial carriers mucosal administration of recombinant lab especially via the best explored and universal oral route offers many advantages in comparison to systemic inoculation and is attractive from the immunological and practical point of view research aimed at designing efficient mucosally applied vaccines in combination with improved immunization efficiency monitoring of in vivo antigen production determination of optimal dose for vaccination strain selection and characterization is a priority in modern vaccinology this paper summarizes and organizes the available knowledge on the application of lab as live oral vaccine vectors it constitutes a valuable source of general information for researchers interested in mucosal vaccine development and constructing lab strains with vaccine potential
bats are increasingly being recognized as important reservoir hosts for a large number of viruses some of them can be highly virulent when they infect human and livestock animals among the new bat zoonotic viruses discovered in recent years several reoviruses respiratory enteric orphan viruses were found to be able to cause acute respiratory infections in humans which included melaka and kampar viruses discovered in malaysia all of them belong to the genus orthoreovirus family reoviridae in this report we describe the isolation of a highly related virus from an adult patient who suffered acute respiratory illness in malaysia although there was no direct evidence of bat origin epidemiological study indicated the potential exposure of the patient to bats before the onset of disease the current study further demonstrates that spillover events of different strains of related orthoreoviruses from bats to humans are occurring on a regular basis which calls for more intensive and systematic surveillances to fully assess the true public health impact of these newly discovered batborne zoonotic reoviruses
influenza is a major public health concern infecting 5-15% of the global population annually influenza virus belongs to family orthomyxoviridae and has three types a b and c infection by influenza virus a is most common and severe generally found in humans it spreads rapidly and affects human population across large geographical region within short period of time with varying degree of pathology from mild to severe wild aquatic birds and other animal species like birds pigs ferret horses seals whales mink giant anteaters cats and dogs are the reservoir for the influenza a virus influenza b and c viruses have very limited host range and appear predominantly in humans influenza virus gains pandemic potential through genetic reassortment called ''genetic shift'' with complete renewal of surface antigen and a small but gradual genetic change by mutations which make it to adapt efficiently in human population called ''genetic drift''. although the epidemiology related to influenza infection has been studied from several years but some facts associated to disease transmission has poorly understood this article reviews the important aspects of virological epidemiological and clinical features related to influenza virus for better understanding of disease transmission and its pathogenesis
objective determine the prevalence of the major enteric pathogens in dairy and dairy beef calves with diarrhoea in australia design cross-sectional study methods faecal samples from 84 australian dairy and dairy beef properties 597 samples were screened for rotavirus and coronavirus using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for salmonella spp using selective enrichment faecal culture and for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k99 and cryptosporidium parvum using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay a logistic regression with random effects model was used to compare prevalence of pathogens in dairy and dairy beef operations enteric pathogens were isolated from 97.6% of outbreaks and 95.0% of samples rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified 477/597 79.9% followed by c parvum 349/597 58.5% salmonella spp 142/597 23.8% coronavirus 129/597 21.6% and e coli k99 104/597 17.4%. multiple pathogens were identified on 96.4% of farms and from 71.0% of samples samples from dairy beef properties were more likely to have multiple pathogens than dairy properties p < 0.05 whereas rotavirus and salmonella spp were more likely to be identified in samples collected from dairy beef than dairy properties p < 0.05 most outbreaks of calf diarrhoea in dairy and dairy beef operations involve multiple pathogens rotavirus and c parvum were the most frequently identified pathogens across production systems salmonella spp and rotavirus were more frequently identified in dairy beef operations

hepatitis e virus strains from rabbits indicate that these mammals may be a reservoir for hevs that cause infection in humans further issues remain to be clarified including whether the genotype of rabbit hev differs from human and swine hev genotype 3 and whether rabbit hev can infect human and other animals hev was found in farmed rabbits in several geographic areas of china in usa and more recently in france the prevalence of antibodies against hev was 36% 57% and 55% in rabbits from virginia usa gansu province and beijing china respectively hev rna was detected in 16.5% of serum samples from farmed rabbits in virginia 7.5% in gansu province and 7.0% in beijing hev rna was detected in 7% of bile samples from farmed rabbits and in 23% of liver samples from wild rabbits in france the full-length genomic sequences analysis indicates that all the rabbit strains belong to the same clade nucleotide sequences were 72.2-78.2% identical to hev genotypes 1-4 comparison with hev sequences of human strains circulating in france and reference sequences identified a human strain closely related to rabbit hev a 93-nucleotide insertion in the x domain of the orf1 of the human strain and in all the rabbit hev strains was found moreover the ability of rabbit hev to cause cross-species infection in a pig model has recently been demonstrated rabbit hev can replicate efficiently in human cell lines collectively these data support the possibility of zoonotic transmission of hev from rabbits
despite an elaborate armamentarium to tackle microbes emerging infectious diseases remain a crucial global challenge emerging infections can be defined as ''infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range.'' several factors like increase in international travel and trade human encroachment on wild-life habitats changes in agricultural practices and wild-life trade have contributed to the emergence of pathogens emergence/ re-emergence of several viral infections has been reported from india in the past few decades some of the important emerging viral infections are discussed in this review they include infection due to nipah hantaviruses chikungunya human enterovirus-71 influenza chandipura crimean congo sars coronavirus buffalopox dengue and japanese encephalitis viruses creating increased awareness and training of clinical microbiologists/virologists for identification of new/emerging pathogens and prompt reporting and management of outbreaks is essential to tackle the threat posed by emerging/re-emerging infections
bats have been identified as the hosts of hepatitis b virus hbv in recent years and bats hbv can infect human hepatocyte we investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of hbv in bats in china in this study a total of 197 insectivorous bats belonging to 10 bat species were captured from karst caves in mengyin county shandong province and xianning city hubei province china pcr amplification indicated that in total 6.6% 13/197 bats were positive to hbvs the hbv positive rate in bats was 7.1% 9/127 and 5.7% 4/70 in shandong province and hubei province respectively phylogenetic analysis indicated that hbv from the two places were in the same cluster with 90.5%-99.5% homology but distinct from bat hbvs from other places in china and other countries we concluded that hbv was prevalent and genetic diversified in bats supporting the hypothesis that bats may be the origin of primate hepadnaviruses
the spike s protein a main surface antigen of sars-coronavirus sars-cov is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design in the present study three fragments of the truncated s protein were expressed in e coli and analyzed with pooled sera of convalescence phase of sars patients the full length s gene dna vaccine was constructed and used to immunize balb/c mice the mouse serum igg antibody against sars-cov was measured by elisa with e coli expressed truncated s protein or sars-cov lysate as diagnostic antigen the results showed that all the three fragments of s protein expressed by e coli was able to react with sera of sars patients and the s gene dna candidate vaccine could induce the production of specific igg antibody against sars-cov efficiently in mice with seroconversion ratio of 75% after 3 times of immunization these findings lay some foundations for further understanding the immunology of sars-cov and developing sars vaccines
in order to estimate the diversity clinical involvement and zoonotic potential of parasites in pigs submitted for diagnosis to the pathopig project of the swiss federal food safety and veterinary office faeces n = 125 from suckling piglets n = 39 weaners n = 60 and piglets beginning fattening n = 26 from 74 swiss farms were examined by 3 coproscopical methods i e sedimentation/zinc chloride-flotation safc and ziehl-neelsen staining samples microscopically positive for cryptosporidium were further tested by pcr/sequencing for species assessment the most frequently detected parasite was balantidium coli a facultative pathogenic ciliate with zoonotic potential in 5.1 36.7 and 50.0% of suckling weaners and fatteners and 43.2% of farms however no association with disease was observed isospora syn cystoisospora suis infections were detected in 13.3 and 11.1% of suckling piglets with and without diarrhoea and in 10.0 and 13.3% of weaners and fatteners with diarrhoea respectively and were significant associated with emaciation cryptosporidium infections were detected in 10.3 15.0 and 19.2% of sucklings weaners and fatteners respectively and in 18.9% of the farms interestingly two age-related species were identified c suis in younger piglets 2 to 6 weeks and c scrofarum in older ones 6 to 17 weeks none of the pigs infected with c scrofarum n = 8 but 3 of 4 piglets infected with c suis coinfection with i suis in 2 cases had diarrhoea the zoonotic species c parvum was not detected nevertheless sporadic cases of human infection with the porcine-adapted species have been reported ascaris suum trichuris suis and strongylida were rarely detected b 4% in all age categories
in the face of the worldwide threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars to human life some of the most urgent challenges are to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for early diagnosis of this disease as well as to create a safe anti-viral vaccine for prevention to these ends we investigated the antigenicity of the spike protein s protein a major structural protein in the sars-coronavirus sars-cov based upon the theoretical analysis for hydrophobicity of the s protein 18 peptides were synthesized using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa these peptides were screened in the sera from sars patients according to these results two fragments of the s gene were amplified by pcr and cloned into pet-32a both s fragments were expressed in the bl-21 strain and further purified with an affinity chromatography these recombinant s fragments were confirmed to have positive cross-reactions with sars sera either by western blot or by elisa our results demonstrated that the potential epitope regions were located at codons 469-882 in the s protein and one epitope site was located at codons 599-620 identification of antigenic regions in the sars-cov s protein may be important for the functional studies of this virus or the development of clinical diagnosis
flying-foxes pteropid bats are the natural host of hendra virus a recently emerged zoonotic virus responsible for mortality or morbidity in horses and humans in australia since 1994 previous studies have suggested physiological and ecological risk factors for infection in flying-foxes including physiological stress however little work has been done measuring and interpreting stress hormones in flying-foxes over a 12month period we collected pooled urine samples from underneath roosting flying-foxes and urine and blood samples from captured individuals urine and plasma samples were assayed for cortisol using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay we demonstrated a typical post-capture stress response in flying-foxes established urine specific gravity as an attractive alternative to creatinine to correct urine concentration and established population-level urinary cortisol ranges and geometric means for the four australian speciespteropus alecto 0.5-305.1 ng/ml 20.1 ng/ml pteropus conspicillatus 0.3-370.9 ng/ml 18.9 ng/ml pteropus poliocephalus 0.3-311.3 ng/ml 10.1 ng/ml pteropus scapulatus 5.2-205.4 ng/ml 40.7 ng/ml geometric means differed significantly except for p alecto and p conspicillatus our approach is methodologically robust and has application both as a research or clinical tool for flying-foxes and for other free-living colonial wildlife species
necrotic enteritis in sucking piglets constitutes a serious problem in piglet rearing units because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with the disease the primary causal agent is clostridium perfringens type c the l-toxin plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of this disease a toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials the european pharmacopoeia monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti-toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin the vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 iu of l-anti-toxin per ml of rabbit serum we have established a range of 17.14^98.23 iu l-anti-toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of c perfringens toxoid vaccine the vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease the outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses use of the vaccine coupled with other measures resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of losses ß
haemophilus parasuis is a gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of swine and is capable of causing a systemic infection resulting in high morbidity and mortality h parasuis isolates display a wide range of virulence and virulence factors are largely unknown commercial bacterins are often used to vaccinate swine against h parasuis though strain variability and lack of cross-reactivity can make this an ineffective means of protection outer membrane vesicles omv are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and omv are often enriched in toxins signaling molecules and other bacterial components examination of omv structures has led to identification of virulence factors in a number of bacteria and they have been successfully used as subunit vaccines we have isolated omv from both virulent and avirulent strains of h parasuis have examined their protein content and assessed their ability to induce an immune response in the host vaccination with purified omv derived from the virulent h parasuis nagasaki strain provided protection against challenge with a lethal dose of the bacteria
the availability of monoclonal antibodies mabs specific for the sars-coronavirus sars-cov is important for the development of both diagnostic tools and treatment of infection a molecular characterization of nine monoclonal antibodies raised in immune mice using highly purified inactivated sars-cov as the inoculating antigen is presented in this report these antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets and six of them are able to effectively neutralize sars-cov in vitro including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075 nm a phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mabs share considerable homology the majority of the heavy chains belong to a single ig germline v-gene family while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences these analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine v h -gene alleles for instance one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the v h chains of the neutralizing mabs particularly in cdr-1 and cdr-2 the results suggest that optimization of murine mabs for neutralization of sars-cov infection will likely be possible and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for sars-cov infection
the objective of this study was to evaluate effects of a combined use of extracts of medicinal herbs taraxaumi mongolicum viola yedoensis makino rhizoma coptidis and radix isatidis myci on porcine epidemic diarrhea ped twenty-two 3-day-old piglets received an oral challenge with 3 × 10 3.5 tcid 50 of the virulent ped virus pedv in pbs or pbs only and daily oral administration of 60 mg of the myci mixture suspended in milk replacer or the vehicle for 7 days in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments average daily gain adg increased p < 0.05 in response to the myci treatment in the pedv-challenged piglets −18 vs 7 g for the vehicle-vs myci-administered group but not in unchallenged animals 27 vs 28 g diarrhea score and fecal pedv shedding however were not influenced by the myci treatment the pedv challenge caused severe intestinal villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia both of which were alleviated by administration of the myci mixture as indicated by an increase in the villus height and a decrease in the crypt depth due to the treatment overall medicinal herb extracts used in this study ameliorated impaired growth performance and intestinal lesion of newborn piglets challenged with the virulent pedv therefore our results suggest that the myci mixture could be used as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against ped
from the severe porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped epidemics that struck in 2013 in the united states of america and other countries of north and south america two types of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv were isolated namely the indel and the non-indel strains they are differentiated by insertions/deletions in the s1 nucleotide sequence of the s gene and differences in virulence were observed from the clinical cases in 2014 a ped outbreak occurred in a pig farm in france from which an indel strain was isolated this study aimed at comparing under experimental conditions the pathogenicity and the direct and indirect transmissions between a non-indel strain isolated from a ped-affected piglet in 2014 in the usa and the french indel strain all infected pigs showed clinical signs with the non-indel strain although only the inoculated and direct contact pigs showed clinical signs in the indel strain group although viral rna was detected in air samples with both strains the indirect contact pigs remained free from infection with the indel strain in contrast to the non-indel group in which airborne transmission occurred in the indirect contact pigs all infected pigs shed virus in faeces regardless of pedv strain with 9 of 30 pigsshowing intermittent faecal shedding the transmission rate by direct contact was found to be 2.17-fold higher than the non-indel strain compared with the indel in conclusion the indel strain was less pathogenic than the non-indel strain in our experimental conditions the transmission route differed between the two strains direct contact was the main transmission route for the indel strain although the non-indel strain was transmitted through direct contact and indirectly through the air epidemiology indel strain non-indel strain pathology porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus transmission
rabies an acute progressive encephalomyelitis caused by viruses in the genus lyssavirus is one of the oldest known infectious diseases although dogs and other carnivores represent the greatest threat to public health as rabies reservoirs it is commonly accepted that bats are the primary evolutionary hosts of lyssaviruses despite early historical documentation of rabies molecular clock analyses indicate a quite young age of lyssaviruses which is confusing for example the results obtained for partial and complete nucleoprotein gene sequences of rabies viruses rabv or for a limited number of glycoprotein gene sequences indicated that the time of the most recent common ancestor tmrca for current bat rabv diversity in the americas lies in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries and might be directly or indirectly associated with the european colonization conversely several other reports demonstrated high genetic similarity between lyssavirus isolates including rabv obtained within a time interval of 25-50 years in the present study we attempted to re-estimate the age of several north american bat rabv lineages based on the largest set of complete and partial glycoprotein gene sequences compiled to date n = 201 employing a codon substitution model although our results overlap with previous estimates in marginal areas of the 95 % high probability density hpd they suggest a longer evolutionary history of american bat rabv lineages tmrca at least 732 years with a 95 % hpd 436-1107 years
background respiratory co-infections are important factor affecting the profitability of pigs production swine influenza virus siv may predispose to secondary infection haemophilus parasuis hps can be a primary pathogen or be associated with other pathogens such as siv to date little is known about the effect of coinfection with siv and hps on the disease severity and inflammatory response and the role of hps in the induction of pneumonia in the absence of other respiratory pathogens in the study we investigated the influence of siv and hps coinfection on clinical course inflammatory response pathogens shedding and load at various time points following intranasal inoculation the correlation between local concentration of cytokines and severity of disease as well as serum acute phase proteins app concentration has been also studied results all co-infected pigs had fever while in single inoculated pigs fever was observed only in part of animals necropsy revealed lesions in the lungs all siv-inoculated and co-inoculated pigs while in hps-single inoculated animals only 1 out of 11 pigs revealed gross lung lesions the siv shedding was the highest in co-inoculated pigs there were no differences between hps-single inoculated and co-inoculated groups with regard to hps shedding the significant increase in hps titre in the lung has been found only in co-inoculated group all app increased after co-infection in single-inoculated animals various kinetics of app response has been observed the lung concentrations of cytokines were induced mostly in siv + hps pigs in the apical and middle lobe these results correlated well with localization of gross lung lesions conclusions the results revealed that siv increased the severity of lung lesions and facilitated hps piwethps192/ 2015 replication in the porcine lung furthermore hps influenced the siv nasal shedding enhanced hps and siv replication together with stronger systemic and local inflammatory response contributed to a more severe clinical signs and stronger earlier immune response in co-inoculated animals we confirmed the previous evidence that single-hps infection does not produce significant pneumonic lesions but it should be in mind that other strains of hps may produce lesions different from that reported in the present study
background bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the parvoviridae family of single-stranded dna viruses and are pathogenic in some mammalian species two species have been previously reported in dogs minute virus of canines mvc associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders and canine bocavirus cbov associated with respiratory disease findings in this study using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis necrotizing vasculitis granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus we named canine bocavirus 3 cnbov3 the three major orfs of cnbov3 ns1 np1 and vp1 shared less than 60% aa identity with those of other bocaviruses qualifying it as a novel species based on ictv criteria inverse pcr showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver conclusions we genetically characterized a bocavirus in a dog liver that is highly distinct from prior canine bocaviruses found in respiratory and fecal samples its role in this animal's complex disease remains to be determined
virus evolves rapidly to escape vaccine-induced immunity posing a desperate demand for efficient vaccine development biotechnologies here we present an express vaccine development strategy based on crispr/cas9 and cre/lox system against re-emerging pseudorabies virus which caused the recent devastating swine pseudorabies outbreak in china by crispr/cas9 system the virulent genes of the newly isolated strain were simultaneously substituted by marker genes which were subsequently excised using cre/lox system for vaccine safety concern notably single cell facs technology was applied to further promote virus purification efficiency the combination of these state-of-art technologies greatly accelerated vaccine development finally vaccination and challenge experiments proved this vaccine candidate's protective efficacy in pigs and the promise to control current pseudorabies outbreak this is to our knowledge the first successful vaccine development based on gene edit technologies demonstrating these technologies leap from laboratory to industry it may pave the way for future express antiviral vaccine development
human monoclonal antibodies humabs prepared from patients with viral infections could provide information on human epitopes important for the development of vaccines as well as potential therapeutic applications through the fusion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a total of five influenzavaccinated volunteers with newly developed murine-human chimera fusion partner cells named spy-meg we obtained 10 hybridoma clones stably producing anti-influenza virus antibodies one for influenza a h1n1 four for influenza a h3n2 and five for influenza b surprisingly most of the humabs showed broad reactivity within subtype and four two for h3n2 and two for b showed broad neutralizing ability importantly epitope mapping revealed that the two broad neutralizing antibodies to h3n2 derived from different donors recognized the same epitope located underneath the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin globular region that is highly conserved among h3n2 strains
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is one of the most challenging subjects of research in veterinary viral immunology and the immune response against prrs virus prrsv still is poorly understood infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease in contrast development of neutralising antibodies nas is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses such as prrsv-specific interferon ifn-c secreting cells is initially erratic in spite of this induction of strong and rapid nas and ifn-c responses seem to be required for effective vaccination prrsv strongly modulates the host's immune responses the virus inhibits key cytokines such as ifn-a and may induce regulatory cytokines such as interleukin il-10 development of nas seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5 this ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates the genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain even within the same genotype with this panorama the development of newer and universally efficacious prrsv vaccines is challenging but the present state of knowledge allows optimism if collaborative efforts are undertaken in the scientific community
background senecavirus a sva a member of the family picornaviridae genus senecavirus is a recently identified single-stranded rna virus closely related to members of the cardiovirus genus sva was originally identified as a cell culture contaminant and was not associated with disease until 2007 when it was first observed in pigs with idiopathic vesicular disease ivd vesicular disease is sporadically observed in swine is not debilitating but is significant due to its resemblance to foreign animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease fmd whose presence would be economically devastating to the united states ivd disrupts swine production until foreign animal diseases can be ruled out identification and characterization of sva as a cause of ivd will help to quickly rule out infection by foreign animal diseases methods we have developed and characterized an indirect elisa assay to specifically identify serum antibodies to sva viral protein 1 2 and 3 vp1 vp2 vp3 were expressed isolated and purified from e coli and used to coat plates for an indirect elisa sera from pigs with and without ivd symptoms as well as a time course following animals from an infected farm were analyzed to determine the antibody responses to vp1 vp2 and vp3 results antibody responses to vp2 were higher than vp1 and vp3 and showed high affinity binding on an avidity elisa roc analysis of the sva vp2 elisa showed a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 89.7%. compared to ifa the quantitative elisa showed an 89% agreement in negative samples and positive samples from 4-60 days after appearance of clinical signs immune sera positive for fmdv encephalomyocarditis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus antibodies did not cross-react conclusions a simple elisa based on detection of antibodies to sva vp2 will help to differentially diagnose ivd due to sva and rule out the presence of economically devastating foreign animal diseases
background escherichia coli a commensal in the intestines of vertebrates is capable of colonizing many different hosts and the environment commensal e coli strains are believed to be the precursor of pathogenic strains by means of acquisition of antimicrobial resistant and virulence genes laboratory rodents are inherently susceptible to numerous known infectious agents which could transfer virulence determinants to commensal e coli hence in this study the genetic structure of commensal e coli found in laboratory rodents and their antimicrobial resistance profiles were investigated results e coli strains belonging to phylogroup a were the predominant strain obtained from the animals used in the study four novel sequence types st746 st747 st748 and st749 were discovered using the multi locus sequence typing together with one common st357 in the gastrointestinal tract liver and the trachea and lung serotyping demonstrated that these commensal e coli strains were non-shiga toxin-producers phenotypic and genotypic analyses of extended spectrum beta lactamases were also negative these findings implied that the e coli strains recovered from the laboratory rodents were truly commensal in nature further study is required to investigate the possible influence of gender on the susceptibility of hosts to e coli colonization in laboratory rodents which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made
coronaviruses covs are widespread among mammals and birds and known for their potential for cross-species transmission in cats infections with feline coronaviruses fcovs are common several non-feline coronaviruses have been reported to infect feline cells as well as cats after experimental infection supported by their ability to engage the feline receptor ortholog for cell entry however whether cats might become naturally infected with covs of other species is unknown we analyzed coronavirus infections in cats by serological monitoring in total 137 cat serum samples and 25 fcov type 1 or type 2-specific antisera were screened for the presence of antibodies against the s1 receptor binding subunit of the cov spike protein which is immunogenic and possesses low amino acid sequence identity among coronavirus species seventy-eight sera were positive for antibodies that recognized one or more coronavirus s1s whereas 1 serum exclusively reacted with human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e and two sera exclusively reacted with porcine delta coronavirus pdcov we observed antigenic cross-reactivity between s1s of type 1 and type 2 fcovs and between fcov type 1 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv domain mapping of antibody epitopes indicated the presence of conserved epitopes particularly in the cd domains of s1 the cross-reactivity of fcov type 1 and pedv was also observed at the level of virus neutralization to conclude we provide the first evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity among s1 proteins of coronaviruses which should be considered in the development of serological diagnoses in addition the potential role of cats in cross-species transmission of coronaviruses cannot be excluded
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a burdensome pathogen in the swine industry wild boar population poses a high risk for reservoir of viral pathogen two hundred eighty seven samples from wild boar sus scrofa collected in south korea during 2010/11 were analyzed using rt-pcr revealing a pedv infection rate of 9.75% 28/287 pedv positive samples were distributed throughout the mainland of south korea clustering at the northern border adjacent to the demilitarized zone dmz and in mountainous regions pedv in wild boar was genetically similar to chinese pedv strains in phylogenetic investigations our results indicated that pedv is circulating in the wild boar and provided a novel knowledge into epidemiology of pedv infection
filoviruses cause severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans filovirus research has been extensive since the 2014 ebola outbreak due to their high pathogenicity and mortality live filoviruses require biosafety level-4 bsl-4 facilities which have restricted the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs an hiv-based pseudovirus cell infection assay is widely used for viral entry studies in bsl-2 conditions here we successfully constructed nine in vitro pseudo-filovirus models covering all filovirus genera and three in vivo pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models using ebola virus marburg virus and lloviu virus as representative viruses the pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed visualizing bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner a bioluminescence peak in mice was reached on day 5 post-infection for ebola virus and marburg virus and on day 4 post-infection for lloviu virus two known filovirus entry inhibitors clomiphene and toremiphene were used to validate the model collectively our study shows that all genera of filoviruses can be well-pseudotyped and are infectious in vitro the pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models can be used for in vivo activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs this sequential in vitro and in vivo evaluation system of filovirus entry inhibitors provides a secure and efficient platform for screening and assessing anti-filovirus agents in bsl-2 facilities
respiratory diseases like infectious bronchitis virus ibv and avian metapneumovirus ampv have been held accountable for major losses for poultry production nevertheless scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies to fill this gap a specific epidemiological study was designed a total of 106 broiler and layer farms including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks were sampled between march 2016 and may 2017 and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for ibv and ampv using rt-pcr based techniques followed by sequencing for each farm data regarding production type flock features clinical signs and vaccination program were also recorded different associations between vaccination protocol production type animal category birds density age presence of clinical signs and ibv and/or ampv infection were tested both ibv and ampv field strain prevalence were proven high approximately 20 and 30% re-spectively being the gi-19 lineage 14 out of 19 73.6% and b subtype 30 out of 30 100% the most commonly detected ibv and ampv genetic types infection with ibv field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence odds ratio = 8.55 . remarkably only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 d of age was proven protective against ibv-induced symptomatology with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 times lower no association was demonstrated between ampv infection and clinical outbreaks or between ampv and ibv detection suggesting the marginal role of the former pathogen in poultry farming globally the present study provides the first detailed investigation of the epidemiological scenario of 2 viruses traditionally considered of pivotal relevance in poultry farming and demonstrates that remarkable benefits could be obtained with just minor adjustments in vaccination protocols
in a feeding trial sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium bacillus cereus var toyoi as a feed additive and the effects on immune cell populations were examined the development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14 28 35 and 56 days post partum tissue samples of the jejunum and the continuous peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy both independent methods of investigation led to similar results the population of intraepithelial cd8+ t cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets p 0.05 and the numbers of gd t cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium p < 0.1 at the time of weaning day 28 lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment application of b cereus var toyoi resulted in significantly more cd25+ lymphocytes and gd t cells in the probiotic group post-weaning the occurrence of pathogenic escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group the finding that the cd8+ t cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of b cereus var toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period the results suggest that feeding of b cereus var toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation #
monoclonal antibodies mabs have long provided powerful research tools for virologists to understand the mechanisms of virus entry into host cells and of antiviral immunity even so commercial development of human or humanized mabs for the prophylaxis preemptive and acute treatment of viral infections has been slow this is surprising as new antibody discovery tools have increased the speed and precision with which potent neutralizing human antiviral mabs can be identified as longstanding barriers to antiviral mab development such as antigenic variability of circulating viral strains and the ability of viruses to undergo neutralization escape are being overcome deeper insight into the mechanisms of mab action and engineering of effector functions are also improving the efficacy of antiviral mabs these successes in both industrial and academic laboratories coupled with ongoing changes in the biomedical and regulatory environments herald an era when the commercial development of human antiviral mab therapies will likely surge antibodies can bind their viral targets with high affinity and exquisite specificity the rationale behind using antiviral mab immunotherapies is that they provide a more potent product with better activity than their polyclonal counterparts virus-neutralizing human mabs have been isolated from both non-immune and immune sources using a wide range of recently developed antibody isolation technologies
simian hemorrhagic fever virus is an arterivirus that naturally infects species of african nonhuman primates causing acute or persistent asymptomatic infections although it was previously estimated that 1% of baboons are shfv-positive more than 10% of wild-caught and captive-bred baboons tested were shfv positive and the infections persisted for more than 10 years with detectable virus in the blood 100-1000 genomes/ml the sequences of two baboon shfv isolates that were amplified by a single passage in primary macaque macrophages had a high degree of identity to each other as well as to the genome of shfv-lvr a laboratory strain isolated in the 1960s infection of japanese macaques with 100 pfu of a baboon isolate consistently produced high level viremia pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated tissue factor levels and clinical signs indicating coagulation defects the baboon virus isolate provides a reliable bsl2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques m a brinton virology 474 2015 186-198
although porcine epidemic diarrhea ped has caused huge economic losses in the pork industry worldwide an effective live attenuated vaccine is lacking in this study an original us highly virulent ped virus pedv strain pc22a was serially passaged in vero ccl81 and vero bi cells the virus growth kinetics in cell culture virulence in neonatal pigs and the whole genomic sequences of selected passages were examined increased virus titers and sizes of syncytia were observed at the 65th passage level p65 and p120 respectively based on the severity of clinical signs histopathological lesions and the distribution of pedv antigens in the gut the virulence of p100 and above but not p95c13 ccl81 was markedly reduced in 4-day-old caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived piglets subsequently the attenuation of p120 and p160 was confirmed in 4-day-old conventional suckling piglets compared with p120 p160 replicated less efficiently in the intestine of pigs and induced a lower rate of protection after challenge sequence analysis revealed that the virulent viruses had one one sixteen including an early termination of nine amino acids and two amino acid differences in nonstructure protein 1 nsp1 nsp4 spike and membrane proteins respectively from the fully attenuated p160 however the overall pattern of attenuation-related genetic changes in pc22a differed from those of the other four pairs of pedv wild type strains and their attenuated derivatives these results suggest that pedv attenuation can occur through multiple molecular mechanisms the knowledge provides insights into potential molecular mechanisms of pedv attenuation
we describe the isolation biological and genetic characterization of a host-range variant of bovine coronavirus bcov detected in water buffalo bubalus bubalis by conventional and real-time rt-pcr assays the virus was demonstrated in the intestinal contents of two 20-day-old buffalo calves dead of a severe form of enteritis and in the feces of additional 17 buffalo calves with diarrhea virus isolation hemagglutination and receptor-destroying enzyme activity showed that the buffalo coronavirus bucov is closely related to bcov but possesses some different biological properties sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 3′ end 9.6 kb of the bucov rna revealed a genomic organization typical of group 2 coronaviruses moreover the genetic distance between bucov and bcov was proven to be the same or even higher than the distance between other ruminant coronaviruses and bcov in conclusion our data support the existence of a host-range variant of bcov associated with enteritis in buffaloes
the iberian lynx is the most endangered felid species in the world confined nowadays to two isolated metapopulations in the southwest of spain where less than 200 individuals survive little is known about the diseases that affect these animals in the wild or in captivity kidney samples from necropsies of 27 iberian lynxes wild and captive were examined by histopathology immunohistochemistry igg igm iga laminin type iv collagen and fibronectin electron microscopy n = 8 and immunogold labelling for igm igg and iga in one case in order to characterize the glomerulopathy prevalent in this species urinalyses from records were available for 9 of the necropsied animals and blood and urine samples from 23 free ranging and captive iberian lynxes were prospectively obtained in order to evaluate the renal function of the living population a focal diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis mgn that progressed with age was diagnosed in all but one of the animals in different stages not associated to concurrently known infectious diseases positive immunoexpression of igm and igg was observed in the glomerular capillary basement membranes and intramembranous electron-dense deposits compatible with immune complexes ics were seen with electron microscopy the immunogold labelling was also positive for igm and igg in the electron-dense areas the serum biochemistry and urinalyses also revealed signs of mild chronic kidney disease in 16 of the 23 animals evaluated in conclusion the membranous glomerulopathy affecting the iberian lynx is a progressive disease of immune origin we postulate a possible genetic predisposition towards the disease enhanced by inbreeding and a possible connection to an immune-mediated systemic disease #
bovine coronavirus bcv was detected by reverse transcriptase-pcr immune electron microscopy or virus isolation from adult cows at 6 out of 6 outbreaks of epizootic diarrhea in japan six bcvs isolated in feces intestinal content or tracheal exudate of the cows were analyzed for their antigenic properties by cross virus neutralization vn tests the isolates were divided into two groups one of which had closely related antigenicity with the reference mebus and kakegawa strains of bcv and another which showed significant differences in vn antibody titers from the reference strains two isolates in the latter group which were from the enteric and respiratory tracts of the same cows respectively were distinguished from each other by elisa using monoclonal antibodies against the kakegawa strain the isolates showed various hemagglutination and receptor destroying enzyme titers against chicken or mouse erythrocytes * bovine coronavirus bcv belongs to antigenic group 2 of the coronaviridae and possesses four major structural proteins the nucleocapsid protein n the integral membrane glycoprotein gp m the hemagglutinin-esterase gp he and the spike gp s . it is known that both he and s gps are involved in hemagglutination ha activity the he gp is a less potent hemagglutinin than the s gp as it only agglutinates erythrocytes from mice and rats and not those from adult chickens the he gp also exhibits receptor destroying enzyme rde activity .bcv is known as a major causative agent of calf diarrhea and winter dysentery of adult cattle . it still remains difficult to isolate the virus on cell cultures thus there have been few papers on the isolation
hepatitis e virus hev causes epidemic and sporadic cases of hepatitis worldwide hev genotypes 3 hev3 and 4 hev4 infect humans and animals with swine being the primary reservoir the relevance of hev genetic diversity to host adaptation is poorly understood we employed a bayesian network bn analysis of hev3 and hev4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype the data imply coevolution among $70% of polymorphic sites from all hev proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans bn models for individual proteins and domains of the nonstructural polyprotein detected the host origin of hev strains with accuracy of 74-93% and 63-87% respectively these findings taken together with lack of phylogenetic association to host suggest that the hev host specificity is a heritable and convergent phenotypic trait achievable through variety of genetic pathways abundance and explain a broad host range for hev3 and hev4 published by elsevier b v
central players of the adaptive immune system are the groups of proteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex mhc which shape the immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides the corresponding genomic region is of particular interest as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome including associations with infectious diseases autoimmune disorders cancers and neuropsychiatric diseases certain mhc molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear it has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments such promiscuous mhc molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens if so the geographical distribution of mhc promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity three lines of evidence support the hypothesis first we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous mhc class ii drb1 alleles second the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution third molecular positions that define promiscuity level of mhc class ii molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations taken together our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology variation in the human genome influences our susceptibility to infectious diseases but the causal link between disease and underlying mutation often remains enigmatic major histocompatibility complex ii mhc class ii molecules shape both our immune response against pathogens and our tolerance of self-peptides the genomic region that encodes plos biology | https//doi mhc molecules is of particular interest as it is home to more genetic disease associations than any other region in the human genome including associations with infectious diseases autoimmune disorders cancers and neuropsychiatric diseases here we propose that mhc class ii molecules can be categorized into two major types specialists initiate effective immune response against only relatively few pathogens while generalists provide protection against a broad range of pathogens as support we demonstrate that generalist mhc class ii variants are more prevalent in human populations residing in pathogenrich areas pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist mhc-ii alleles in human populations plos biology | https//doi org/10 immunodeficiency virus pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist mhc-ii alleles in human populations plos biology | https//doi org/10
feline immunode®ciency virus fiv is a natural infection of domestic cats that results in acquired immunode®ciency syndrome resembling human immunode®ciency virus hiv infection in humans the worldwide prevalence of fiv infection in domestic cats has been reported to range from 1 to 28%. hence an effective fiv vaccine will have an important impact on veterinary medicine in addition to being used as a small animal aids model for humans since the discovery of fiv reported in 1987 fiv vaccine research has pursued both molecular and conventional vaccine approaches toward the development of a commercial product published fiv vaccine trial results from 1998 to the present have been compiled to update the veterinary clinical and research communities on the immunologic and experimental ef®cacy status of these vaccines a brief report is included on the outcome of the 10 years of collaborative work between industry and academia which led to recent usda approval of the ®rst animal lentivirus vaccine the dual-subtype fiv vaccine the immunogenicity and ef®cacy of the experimental prototype dual-subtype fiv vaccine and the ef®cacy of the currently approved commercial dual-subtype fiv vaccine fel-o-vax fiv are discussed potential cross-reactivity complications between commercial fiv diagnostic tests idexx snap combo test 1 and western blot assays and sera from previously vaccinated cats are also discussed finally recommendations are made for unbiased critical testing of new fiv vaccines the currently usda approved vaccine and future vaccines in development #
several studies have reported the detection of herpesviruses hvs in bats however the prevalence and phylogenetic characteristics of hvs in bats are still poorly understood to elucidate the epidemiological characteristics of bat hvs in southern china 520 fecal samples from eight bat species were collected in four geographic regions of southern china of these samples 73 14.0 % tested positive for hvs using nested polymerase chain reaction assay phylogenetic analysis revealed a high degree of molecular diversity of hvs in bats of different species from different geographic regions our study provides evidence for co-evolution of bats and hvs
rhinovirus-specific antibodies have traditionally been detected by their ability to neutralise the homologous rhinovirus serotype in tissue culture recently however we have described an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects rhinovirus-specific antibodies in sera and nasal secretions [barclay and .a-nakib 19871 here we describe an evaluation of the elisa in a study involving 71 adult volunteers inoculated intranasally with human rhinovirus type 2 hrv-2 preand post-inoculation serum samples and pre-inoculation nasal washings were tested for the presence of hrv-2-specific antibodies by elisa such antibodies were associated with protection against infection when present locally in nasal secretions but when also present in the serum they were associated with protection against both infection and the development of illness the antibody concentrations showed strong correlation with each other and with that of antibodies detected by the neutralisation test following hrv-2 infection rises in hrv-2-specific iga in sera detected by elisa occurred more frequently than rises in neutralising antibody these results suggest that the elisa is a sensitive and reliable indicator of recent infection as well as a predictor of homologous immune status
outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn piglets without detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov have been recorded in a pig farm in southern china since february 2017 isolation and propagation of the pathogen in cell culture resulted in discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus tentatively named seacov related to the bat coronavirus hku2 identified in the same region a decade ago specific fluorescence signal was detected in vero cells infected with seacov by using a positive sow serum collected in the same farm but not by using tgev- pedv-or pdcov-specific antibody electron microscopy observation demonstrated that the virus particle with surface projections was 100-120 nm in diameter complete genomic sequencing and analyses of seacov indicated that the extreme amino-terminal domain of the seacov spike s glycoprotein structurally similar to the domain 0 of the alphacoronavirus nl63 whereas the rest part of s structurally resembles domains b to d of the betacoronavirus the seacov-s domain 0 associated with enteric tropism had an extremely high variability harboring 75-amino-acid aa substitutions and a 2-aa insertion compared to that of hku2 which is likely responsible for the extended host range or cross-species transmission the isolated virus was infectious in pigs when inoculated orally into 3-day-old newborn piglets leading to clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal virus shedding these results confirmed that it is a novel swine enteric coronavirus representing the fifth porcine coronavirus
although vesicular stomatitis virus vsv neurovirulence and pathogenicity in rodents have been well studied little is known about vsv pathogenicity in non-human primates to address this question we measured vsv viremia shedding and neurovirulence in macaques following intranasal inoculation macaques shed minimal recombinant vsv rvsv in nasal washes for 1 day post-inoculation viremia was not detected following intranasal inoculation of macaques wild type wt vsv rvsv and two rvsv-hiv vectors showed no evidence of spread to cns tissues however macaques inoculated intrathalamically with wt vsv developed severe neurological disease one of four macaques receiving rvsv developed clinical and histological signs similar to the wt group while the remaining three macaques in this group and all of the macaques in the rvsv-hiv vector groups showed no clinical signs of disease and reduced severity of histopathology compared to the wt group the implications of these findings for rvsv vaccine development are discussed
the possible bioterrorism threat using the variola virus the causative agent of smallpox has promoted us to further investigate the immunogenicity profiles of existing vaccines here we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replicationcompetent smallpox vaccine vaccinia tiantan vtt strain for inducing neutralizing antibodies nabs through mucosal vaccination which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular i m intranasal i n oral i o and subcutaneous s c inoculations in mice we found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of vtt was able to induce anti-vtt nabs via each of the four routes higher levels of antiviral nabs however were induced via the i n and i o inoculations when compared with the i m and s c routes moreover the i n and i o vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of nabs overtime which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination the vtt-induced immunity via all four routes however was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge our data have implications for understanding the potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination and for developing vtt-based vaccines to overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity
canine parvovirus cpv and canine coronavirus ccov are considered the main pathogens responsible for acute gastroenteritis in dogs from a collection of 250 samples seven cpv strains and three ccov strains were identified in symptomatic irish dogs samples were screened for the viruses using polymerase chain reaction pcr and typed via dna sequence analysis three cpv strains were characterized as cpv-2a while four others were characterized as cpv-2b to date cpv-2c remains unreported in ireland two ccov strains were characterized as ccov-ii and one as ccov-i in the case of one sample ph4/09/ire a mixed infection with cpv and ccov was detected canine parvovirus type 2 cpv and canine coronavirus ccov are considered the main pathogens responsible for acute gastroenteritis in dogs . cpv was first identified in the late 1970s as a major cause of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and myocarditis in puppies . cpv has a small single-stranded dna genome of 5.2 kilobases kb symptoms of cpv infection vary from mild to haemorrhagic enteritis fever vomiting and death in severe cases coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense rna
to evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of porcine sapeloviruses psvs in korea a total of 100 diarrhea fecal samples from pigs were analyzed by rt-pcr and nested pcr assays with primer pairs specific for the vp1 gene overall 34 % of the diarrhea samples tested positive for psv and a high proportion of infections occurred along with a variety of other enteric viruses and bacteria genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the vp1 genes revealed pronounced genetic diversities between psvs from korean and elsewhere our results indicate that psv infections are very common in korean pigs with diarrhea the infecting strains are genetically diverse
modified live virus mlv vaccines are commonly used to reduce the impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs but limited efficacy is achieved in field conditions here we evaluated the impact of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies mdnas on vaccine efficacy after prrs virus prrsv challenge piglets with low aà or high a+ mdna levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated v+ or not và with a prrsv-1 mlv vaccine at 3 weeks of age woa because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in aàv+ piglets post-vaccination pv all v+ piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa five weeks w5 pv piglets were inoculated with a prrsv-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection and were mingled 24 h later with noninoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission vaccine strain was detected at w2 pv in 69% and 6% of aàv+ and a+v+ piglets and at w5 pv in 50% and 25% of aàv+ and a+v+ piglets respectively at w5 pv 94% of aàv+ and 44% of a+v+ piglets seroconverted with a significant ifng response induction in the aàv+ group only after challenge compared to the và inoculated group viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in aàv+ whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in a+v+ piglets a lower transmission rate was estimated for the aàv+ group 0.15 versus 0.44 and 0.32 for the a+v+ and và groups respectively investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between ifna levels and vaccine strain detection in aàv+ piglets we showed that mdnas impair vaccine efficacy against prrsv both in inoculated and contact piglets probably by reducing vaccine replication ifna may also interfere with prrsv vaccination these new data could help improving vaccination protocols
the immunogenicity of sars-cov nucleocapsid dna vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin-2 il-2 were investigated dna vaccine plasmids pcdna-n and pcdna-il2 were constructed and inoculated into balb/c mice with or without pcdna-il2 by intramuscular injection cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by indirect elisa lymphocyte proliferation assays elispot and facs the nucleocapsid dna vaccine had good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and cellular immunity in balb/c mice while il-2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances specific immune responses this study provides a frame of reference for the design of dna vaccines against sars-cov

the trichomonad species tritrichomonas fetus and pentatrichomonas hominis were recently identified in the feces of dogs with diarrhea however the prevalence and pathogenicity of these parasites in the canine population still remained poorly resolved therefore the aim of the present study was 1 to determine the prevalence of trichomonads infecting puppies living in french breeding kennels 2 to confirm the predominance of p hominis in dogs 3 to investigate the genetic diversity of p hominis isolates identified in the french canine population and 4 to evaluate the risk factors for infection by p hominis and the influence of the parasite on feces consistency a total of 215 both diarrheic and non-diarrheic puppies from 25 french breeding kennels were included in this epidemiological survey fecal samples from each puppy were examined for 6 gastrointestinal pathogens parvovirus type 2 cpv2 coronavirus toxocara canis cystoisospora ohioensis-complex cystoisospora canis and giardia intestinalis a part of each collected stool was also tested for the presence of motile trichomonads by microscopy after culturing the prevalence of trichomonad infection was 15.8% 34/215 among puppies and 20% 5/25 among breeding kennels dna from 26 of the 34 positive samples was successfully amplified using a trichomonad-specific primer pair analysis of the sequences of pcr products indicated that p hominis was the only trichomonad infecting the canine population all the puppies infected with p hominis belonged to large breed dogs moreover puppies from large breeding kennels excreting a high level of g intestinalis and/or excreting a high level of c canis oocysts showed a higher probability of being positive for p hominis infection univariate analysis also revealed an increased risk for p hominis infection in puppies with abnormal feces however in a multivariate analysis cpv2 was the only gastrointestinal pathogen associated with abnormal feces since enteropathogens were commonly found in dogs infected by p hominis the pathogenic potential of this trichomonad species remained uncertain and has to be further evaluated by experimental infection studies
three strains of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec 064ksnt k88ac opoksnt k88ac and 08k85ab k99 originally cultured from outbreaks of diarrhoea in piglets a few hours old were administered orally to gnotobiotic piglets there was a marked age-related difference in the clinical response to infection between the 3 strains although they all produced heat-stable toxin all 3 strains produced severe clinical signs of depression anorexia vomiting diarrhoea followed by dehydration and death in one-day-old piglets in piglets infected at 3 days of age the two k88+ etec caused diarrhoea and death but the k99+ etec induced moderate diarrhoea only in piglets infected at 7 days of age the 064 strain produced severe diarrhoea and death the 020 strain caused mild diarrhoea in 3 of 6 piglets with one death while the 08 strain caused no illness pathological changes in the intestinal tract associated with these infections were minimal or absent lmmunofluorescent staining with homologous hyperimmune sera demonstrated adherence of the 3 etec strains to the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells fluorescing organisms were observed in all infected piglets irrespective of the severity of clinical signs but the degree and extent of colonisation varied with the age of the piglets and the infecting strain this may explain the difference in clinical response between the 3 strains ausf vet j . 59 93
the prediction of viral zoonosis epidemics has become a major public health issue a profound understanding of the viral population in key animal species acting as reservoirs represents an important step towards this goal bats harbor diverse viruses some of which are of particular interest because they cause severe human diseases however little is known about the diversity of the global population of viruses found in bats virome we determined the viral diversity of five different french insectivorous bat species nine specimens in total in close contact with humans sequence-independent amplification high-throughput sequencing with illumina technology and a dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline were used on pooled tissues brain liver and lungs comparisons of the sequences of contigs and unassembled reads provided a global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences for each sample highlighting differences both within and between bat species many viral families were present in these viromes including viruses known to infect bacteria plants/fungi insects or vertebrates the most relevant being those infecting mammals retroviridae herpesviridae bunyaviridae poxviridae flaviviridae reoviridae bornaviridae picobirnaviridae in particular we detected several new mammalian viruses including rotaviruses gammaretroviruses bornaviruses and bunyaviruses with the identification of the first bat nairovirus these observations demonstrate that bats naturally harbor viruses from many different families most of which infect mammals they may therefore constitute a major reservoir of viral diversity that should be analyzed carefully to determine the role played by bats in the spread of zoonotic viral infections
h7n9 influenza virus has been circulating among humans for five epidemic waves since it was first isolated in 2013 in china the recent increase in h7n9 infections during the fifth outbreak in china has caused concerns of a possible pandemic in this study we describe a previously characterized human monoclonal antibody hnigga6 obtained by isolating rearranged heavy-chain and light-chain genes from patients who had recovered from h7n9 infections hnigga6 recognized multiple has and neutralized the infectivity of 11 out of the 12 h7n9 strains tested as well as three emerging hpai h7n9 isolates the only resistant strain was a/shanghai/1/2013 h7n9-sh1 which carries the avian receptor alleles 186v and 226q in the sialic acid-binding pocket the mab broadly neutralized divergent h7n9 strains from 2013 to 2017 and represents a potential alternative treatment for h7n9 interventions
avian influenza a virus constitutes a large threat to human health recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 virus in poultry and in humans have raised concerns that an influenza pandemic will occur in the near future transmission from avian species to humans remains sporadic but the mortality associated with human infection is very high about 62%. to date there are no effective therapeutic drugs or a prophylactic vaccines available which means that there is still a long way to go before we can eradicate or cure avian influenza this review focuses on the molecular pathogenesis of avian influenza h5n1 virus infection an understanding of the viral pathogenesis may facilitate the development of novel treatments or effective eradication of this fatal disease avian flu h5n1 acute lung injury
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has been recognized as a swine pathogen for 40 years but until 2013 had not been detected in the western hemisphere from originally causing a relatively mild and sporadic disease pedv has been more recently associated with severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease in asia and subsequently north america pedv shares some important characteristics with two major pandemic viruses porcine reproductive and respiratory virus porcine circovirus type 2 of pigs that have high rates of mutation and high host specificity and appear to have been present in the swine virome for decades prior to emerging to cause severe clinical disease a unique feature of the pedv in north america has been the implication of feed as a vehicle for transmission with particular concerns related to ingredients of porcine origin the importance of relatively rare events in contributing to both the emergence and transmission of pedv is discussed in relation to approaches for managing the associated risks
salmonella typhimurium is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens worldwide and a major cause of economic losses in the pig production chain the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains over the past years has led to considerations about an enhanced surveillance of bacterial food contamination currently elisa is the method of choice for high throughput identification of s typhimurium the sensitivity and specificity of this assay might be improved by application of new diagnostic antibodies we focused on plant-based expression of candidate diagnostic tm43-e10 antibodies discovered using as antigen the s typhimurium ompd protein the scfv-tm43-e10 and scfv-fc-tm43-e10 antibody derivatives have been successfully produced in n benthamiana using a deconstructed movementdeficient pvx vector supplemented with the gb silencing suppressor from poa semilatent virus the plant-made antibodies showed the same antigen-binding specificity as that of the microbial/mammalian cell-produced counterparts and could recognize the ompd antigen in s typhimurium infected plant samples
emerging infectious diseases eids have always been one of the major threats to public health although the implementation of mandatory testing for 4 classical transfusion-transmitted infectious-human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus and syphilis-has reduced the transfusion risk of these pathogens the potential threat of various eid agents and their constantly evolving variants to blood safety in china is not fully understood this review presents 9 representative eid agents that are autochthonous and epidemic nationally or regionally in china the epidemiologic status and distribution of these eid agents among donors and/or healthy populations are summarized the potential risks of these eid agents to blood safety are discussed the review also explores strategies to strengthen hemovigilance systems and studies to further evaluate the impact of eid agents on blood safety
avipoxviruses apvs belong to the chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the poxviridae family apvs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic pet and wild birds of many species apvs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated the virus species fowlpox virus fwpv causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low but in flocks under stress other diseases high production mortality can reach up to 50%. apvs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine abortive infection in mammalian cells no production of progeny viruses and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make apvs promising vaccine vectors although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage molecular mechanisms restricting apvs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood this review summarizes the current knowledge relating to apvs including classification morphogenesis host-virus interactions diagnostics and disease and also highlights the use of apvs as recombinant vaccine vectors
wild carnivores are at the top of the trophic chain they are predators and carrion consumers and thus prone to come in contact with disease agents contaminating the environment or infecting live or dead animals we hypothesized that wild canids could be used as sentinels for the detection of regions with higher mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis map prevalence in wild and domestic animals to test this hypothesis we set up an elisa to test 262 wolf canis lupus and fox vulpes vulpes sera for map-specific antibodies and processed a subset of samples for culture n= 61 map-specific pcr 15 and histopathology 14 in wolves the optical density od values in the elisa were continuously distributed ten fox sera 4% had od readings of over twice the mean suggesting contact with mycobacteria however all samples tested by pcr were negative for both is900 and ismap02 sequences and samples cultured for map yielded no growth no visible paratuberculosis or tuberculosis-compatible lesions were recorded on histopathological examination no lesions compatible with mycobacterial diseases were observed these results suggest that wild canids show little or no evidence of paratuberculosis and are unlikely to be useful sentinels for the detection of map in southwestern europe
the iberian lynx lynx pardinus is the most endangered felid in the world to determine whether sympatric carnivores are reservoirs of pathogens posing a disease risk for the lynx evidence of exposure to 17 viral bacterial and protozoan agents was investigated in 176 carnivores comprising 26 free-living lynx 53 domestic cats 28 dogs 33 red foxes vulpes vulpes 24 egyptian mongooses herpestes ichneumon 10 common genets genetta genetta and 2 eurasian badgers meles meles in the areas inhabited by the last two populations of iberian lynx both in andalusia south-western spain the results indicated that the lynx had low rates of contact with viral pathogens with one seropositive finding each for feline leukemia virus parvovirus and canine adenovirus-1 whereas contact with bacteria and protozoa appeared more frequent active infections with parvovirus ehrlichia spp mycobacterium bovis leptospira interrogans and cytauxzoon spp were confirmed in contrast 53% of the domestic cats were exposed to some infectious agent prevalence range 4.5-11.4%. antibodies to canine distemper virus and parvovirus were frequently found in dogs 32% and 42% respectively and foxes 30% and 12%. past or present infections with parvovirus ehrlichia spp chlamydophila spp m bovis salmonella enterica l interrogans toxoplasma gondii and neospora caninum were also detected in these and other species surveyed questionnaires to owners revealed that 14% of the dogs but none of the cats had been vaccinated and no cat had been neutered based on the apparent absence of acquired immunity of the lynx against infectious agents the frequent detection of agents among sympatric carnivores and the reported lack of immunocompetence of the iberian lynx a disease outbreak among the local abundant carnivores may pose a serious disease risk for lynx conservation
recent events surrounding emerging infectious diseases bioterrorism and increasing multidrug antibiotic resistance in bacteria have drastically increased current needs for effective vaccines many years of study have shown that live attenuated pathogens are often more effective at delivering heterologous protein or dna to induce protective immune responses however these vaccine carriers have inherent safety concerns that have limited their development and their use in many patient populations studies using nonliving delivery mechanisms have shown that providing both protein antigen and dna encoding the antigen to an individual induces an improved more protective immune response but rarely if ever are both delivered simultaneously here non-replicating bacterial minicells derived from a commensal e coli strain are shown to effectively induce antigen-specific immune responses after simultaneous protein and dna delivery these data demonstrate the potential use of achromosomal bacterial minicells as a vaccine carrier
african pythons pythonidae and large vipers bitis spp act as definitive hosts for armillifer armillatus and armillifer grandis parasites crustacea pentastomida in the congo basin since the proportion of snakes in bushmeat gradually increases human pentastomiasis is an emerging zoonotic disease to substantiate the significance of this threat we surveyed snakes offered for human consumption at bushmeat markets in the kole district democratic republic of the congo for the presence of adult pentastomids in bitis vipers n = 40 armillifer spp infestations exhibited an 87.5% prevalence and 6.0 median intensity parasite abundance covaried positively with viper length but not with body mass in pythons n = 13 armillifer spp exhibited a 92.3% prevalence and 3.5 median intensity the positive correlations between parasite abundance and python length or mass were statistically nonsignificant ninety-one percent of a grandis were discovered in vipers and 97% of infected vipers hosted a grandis whereas 81% of a armillatus specimens were found in pythons and 63% of infected pythons hosted a armillatus thus challenging the widespread notion of strict host specificity we found 'reversed' infections and even a case of coinfection in this study we also gathered information about the snake consumption habits of different tribal cultures in the area infective parasite ova likely transmit to humans directly by consumption of uncooked meat or indirectly through contaminated hands kitchen tools or washing water
this study evaluated removal of live emerging waterborne pathogens by pilot-scale conventional treatment with alum coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration the microbes tested were cryptosporidium parvum oocysts encephalitozoon intestinalis spores enteropathogenic escherichia coli o157h7 aeromonas hydrophila and bacteriophage ms2 the study showed the effects of filter run time alternative loading rates alternative filter media and ph on pathogen removal results indicated that turbidity breakthrough was accompanied by breakthrough of all pathogens tested in this study results also suggest that the breakthrough of a hydrophila and e coli o157h7 occurred more rapidly than that of turbidity in general filtration rate or alternative filter media configurations had no apparent effect on pathogen removal

an investigation into the causes of canine infectious respiratory disease was carried out in a large rehoming kennel tissue samples taken from the respiratory tract of diseased dogs were tested for the presence of coronaviruses using rt-pcr with conserved primers for the polymerase gene sequence analysis of four positive samples showed the presence of a coronavirus with high similarity to both bovine and human coronavirus strain oc43 in their polymerase and spike genes whereas there was a low similarity to comparable genes in the enteric canine coronavirus this canine respiratory coronavirus crcv was detected by rt-pcr in 32/119 tracheal and 20/119 lung samples with the highest prevalence being detected in dogs with mild clinical symptoms serological analysis showed that the presence of antibodies against crcv on the day of entry into the kennel decreased the risk of developing respiratory disease
equine coronavirus ecov is considered an enteric pathogen of foals and has only recently been associated with infections in adult horses seroprevalence data is needed to better understand the epidemiology of ecov in adult horses evaluate diagnostic modalities and develop preventive measures the objective of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and selective risk factors for ecov in 5247 healthy adult horses in the usa using a recently established and validated igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay prevalence factors analysed in this study included geographic region age breed sex and use a total of 504/5247 horses 9.6% horses tested seropositive geographic region mid-west p = 0.008 breed draft horses p = 0.003 and specific uses of horses ranch/farm p = 0.034 breeding use p = 0.016 were all statistically significant risk factors for seropositivity
human adenoviral had vectors have demonstrated great potential as vaccine vectors preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of vector design robust antigen expression and protective immunity using this system however clinical use of adenoviral vectors for vaccine purposes is anticipated to be limited by vector immunity that is either preexisting or develops rapidly following the first inoculation with adenoviral vectors vector immunity inactivates the vector particles and rapidly removes the transduced cells thereby limiting the duration of transgene expression due to strong vector immunity subsequent use of the same vector is usually less efficient in order to circumvent this limitation nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been proposed as alternative vectors in addition to eluding had immunity these vectors possess most of the attractive features of had vectors several replication-competent or replication-defective nonhuman adenoviral vectors have been developed and investigated for their potential as vaccine-delivery vectors here we review recent advances in the design and characterization of various nonhuman adenoviral vectors and discuss their potential applications for human and animal vaccination
cervical cancer cacx is strongly associated with human papillomavirus hpv infection particularly hpv types 16 and 18 the constitutive expression of hpv e6 and e7 proteins in cacx makes them attractive targets for ctl based immunotherapy however cervical carcinomas may have features e g antigen processing defects that limit the effectiveness of hpv specific ctl furthermore most vaccine development has concentrated on hpv type 16 and it is not clear whether such vaccines could induce ctl able to cross-react on related oncogenic hpv types e g hpv31 and 52 to investigate these potentially important parameters in vitro we used a ctl d4 specific for hpv16 e7 11-20 . d4 was able to kill a variety of hpv16؉ cacx cell lines including those with suspected caski or known antigen processing defects c33a and with low hpv dna copy number siha d4 was also able to cross react on a related peptide from hpv52 e7 but not hpv31 e7 further analysis suggested that d4 cross reactivity against related peptides was influenced both by tcr contact residues and a certain threshold for peptide binding the hpv cross-reactivity was confirmed at the whole protein level as d4 was also able to recognize the endogenously processed forms of hpv16 and 52 e7 but not 31 e7 these results suggest that hpv16 e7 11-20 would be a useful epitope for immunotherapy in both hpv 16 and 52 tumours despite this it is difficult to generate these ctl in response to vaccination emphasizing the need for definition of novel epitopes and more efficient vaccination strategies
in this study we evaluated antibody and cell-mediated immune cmi responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments and protection against challenge with a nephropathogenic brazilian br-i strain of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in chickens submitted to a vaccination regime comprising a priming dose of heterologous live attenuated massachusetts vaccine followed by a booster dose of an experimental homologous inactivated vaccine two weeks later this immunization protocol elicited significant increases in serum and lachrymal levels of anti-ibv igg antibodies and upregulated the expression of cmi response genes such as those encoding cd8β chain and granzyme homolog a in tracheal and kidney tissues at 3 7 and 11 days post-infection in the vaccinated chickens additionally vaccinated and challenged chickens showed reduced viral loads and microscopic lesion counts in tracheal and kidney tissues and their antibody and cmi responses were negatively correlated with viral loads in the trachea and kidney in conclusion the combination of live attenuated vaccine containing the massachusetts strain with a booster dose of an inactivated vaccine containing a br-i ibv strain confers effective protection against infection with nephropathogenic homologous ibv strain because of the induction of consistent memory immune responses mediated by igg antibodies and tcd8 cells in the mucosal and systemic compartments of chickens submitted to this vaccination regime
most human infectious diseases especially recently emerging pathogens originate from animals and ongoing disease transmission from animals to people presents a significant global health burden recognition of the epidemiologic circumstances involved in zoonotic spillover amplification and spread of diseases is essential for prioritizing surveillance and predicting future disease emergence risk we examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date and discover that viruses with high host plasticity i e taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity our findings suggest that animal-to-human spillover of new viruses that are capable of infecting diverse host species signal emerging disease events with higher pandemic potential in that these viruses are more likely to amplify by human-to-human transmission with spread on a global scale emerging re-emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases continue to place a substantial burden on global health particularly where dense human populations and pressures on environmental and economic resources are greatest over one billion cases of human zoonotic disease are estimated to occur annually and novel emerging zoonoses have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses 1 . given the rich diversity of animal life on our planet it is not surprising that animals are the source of most human infectious diseases with centuries of intimate contact with domesticated species facilitating the early transmission of the most adaptable pathogens to humans 2 . recent recognition that the majority of emerging infectious disease events have wildlife origins 3 highlights the need for a deep understanding of the type of contact between wild animals and people that enables disease transmission opportunities for close contact between humans and wild animals are relatively rare compared to contact with domestic animals yet recent emergence of many diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome nipah virus encephalitis and ebola highlight the threat that wildlife pathogens pose to global health security 4 .after centuries of documented outbreaks we have now begun to unravel the mechanisms underlying disease transmission from animals to people here we focus on zoonotic viruses which are the most frequently emerging human pathogen constituting less than 15% of all known species of human pathogens but over 65% of pathogens discovered since 1980 5 . we seek to understand the mechanisms facilitating transmission of viruses from animals to people with special attention to the human activities enabling direct and indirect contact with wild animal hosts resulting in recent human outbreaks by evaluating data reported for all known zoonotic viruses we test long-held assumptions regarding common traits among viruses that have spilled over from animals and activities facilitating their transmission we use network analyses to evaluate sharing of viruses by animal hosts and high-risk transmission interfaces
long-term protection from sars coronavirus infection conferred by a single immunization with an attenuated vsv-based vaccine virology 3402 174-82 because it is difficult to obtain regulatory approval of vaccine based on live viruses we constructed a replication-defective single-cycle vsv vector in which we replaced the vsv glycoprotein g gene with the sars-cov s gene the virus was only able to infect cells when pseudotyped with the vsv g protein we measured the effectiveness of immunization with the single-cycle vaccine in mice we found that the vaccine given intramuscularly induced a neutralizing antibody response to sars-cov that was approximately ten-fold greater than that required for the protection from sars-cov infection and significantly greater than that generated by the replication-competent vector expressing sars-cov s protein given by the same route our results along with earlier studies showing potent induction of t-cell responses by single-cycle vectors indicate that these vectors are excellent alternatives to live-attenuated vsv
in late 2019 cases of atypical pneumonia were detected in china the etiological agent was quickly identified as a betacoronavirus named sars-cov-2 which has since caused a pandemic several methods allowing for the specific detection of viral nucleic acids have been established but these only allow detection of the virus during a short period of time generally during acute infection serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection here we describe a detailed protocol for expression of antigens derived from the spike protein of sars-cov-2 that can serve as a substrate for immunological assays as well as a two-stage serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa these assays can be used for research studies and for testing in clinical laboratories basic protocol 1 mammalian cell transfection and protein purification basic protocol 2 a two-stage elisa for high-throughput screening of human serum samples for antibodies binding to the spike protein of sars-cov-2 keywords covid19 r covid-19 r elisa r protein expression r sars-cov-2 r serological assay
bluetongue bt is a noncontagious insect-transmitted disease of ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus btv a laboratory animal model would greatly facilitate the studies of pathogenesis immune response and vaccination against btv herein we show that adult mice deficient in type i ifn receptor ifnar 2/2 are highly susceptible to btv-4 and btv-8 infection when the virus is administered intravenously disease was characterized by ocular discharges and apathy starting at 48 hours post-infection and quickly leading to animal death within 60 hours of inoculation infectious virus was recovered from the spleen lung thymus and lymph nodes indicating a systemic infection in addition a lymphoid depletion in spleen and severe pneumonia were observed in the infected mice furthermore ifnar 2/2 adult mice immunized with a btv-4 inactivated vaccine showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies against btv-4 and complete protection against challenge with a lethal dose of this virus the data indicate that this mouse model may facilitate the study of btv pathogenesis and the development of new effective vaccines for btv
monodominant patches of forest dominated by gilbertiodendron dewevrei are commonly found in central african tropical forests alongside forests with high species diversity although these forests are generally found sparsely distributed along rivers their occurrence is not thought to be clearly driven by edaphic conditions but rather by trait combinations of g dewevrei that aid in achieving monodominance functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has however not yet been compared additionally little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community these two topics are addressed in this study we investigate the functional community structure of 10 one-hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the congo basin in dr congo thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured covering 95% basal area weighted of all species present in the plots including leaf nutrient contents leaf isotopic compositions specific leaf area wood density and vessel anatomy the trait-based assessment of g dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers moreover indications have been found for n and p limitations in the monodominant forest possibly related to ectomycorrhizal associations formed with g dewevrei reduced leaf n and p contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest and for different nondominant groups as compared to those in the mixed forest in summary this work shows that environmental filtering does prevail in the monodominant g dewevrei forest leading to lower functional diversity in this forest type with the dominant species showing beneficial traits related to its common riverine locations and with reduced soil n and p availability found in this environment both coregulating the tree community assembly democratic republic of congo environmental filtering functional traits gilbertiodendron dewevrei plant population and community dynamics single-species dominance species establishment
hyper-reactivity to non-specific challenges has been considered a hallmark of asthma and is defined as an abnormal responsiveness of the bronchial airways to a variety of provocative agents the mechanisms underlying hyper-reactivity in the upper and lower airways are not known by using the nose to study the inflammatory response possible abnormalities can be investigated carefully and pathophysiology of specific airway hyper-reactivities can be better understood other factors than merely constriction of the bronchial smooth muscles can cause narrowing of the free lumen to airflow functionally different and very distinct mucosal end-organ reactivities may also be increased if these reactivities can be well assessed specific airway hyper-reactivity can be defined in the present report specific mucosal end-organ hyper-reactivites in the allergic nasal mucosa are presented certain widespread hypotheses such as the role of the eosinophil and the "increased absorption permeability theory" are disputed
rotaviruses rvs are important enteric pathogens of newborn humans and animals causing diarrhea and in rare cases death especially in very young individuals rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced non-infectious rotavirus-like particles rvlps are efficient while being entirely safe however using either vaccine active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system we therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles the simultaneous expression of the rv capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of rvlps in various cell lines vaccinated dams developed a strong rv specific igg antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups moreover sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had rv specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against rv in humans as well as in various animal species
postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws in swine is causally associated with the newly recognised pathogen porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 in this study 3-week-old spf pcv2seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with pcv2 the effect of immunostimulation on the induction of pmws was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh emulsi®ed in incomplete freunds adjuvant the study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation while disease was not observed in the age-matched controls two out of ®ve non-immunised pcv2infected piglets died on postinoculation day pid 21 and one was euthanized on pid 25 in moribund condition these animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from pid 12 onwards the euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice at postmortem examination gastric ulceration icterus and liver and thymus atrophy were observed furthermore histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of pmws one out of ®ve immunostimulated pcv2-infected piglets was euthanized on pid 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting this pig was lethargic from pid 14 onwards with persistent fever from veterinary microbiology 89 2002 97±114 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 0 2 0 0 1 7 4 -8 pid 8 and transient dyspnoea no differences in clinical signs gross pathologic or histological ®ndings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated pcv2infected piglets all 10 pcv2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to pcv2 within 14 days after inoculation by virus isolation quantitative polymerase chain reaction q-pcr and immunostaining of cryostat sections it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant pcv2 antigen viral dna load in serum samples was assessed by q-pcr all four pmws-affected piglets had high levels of pcv2 dna in serum suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral dna in serum and the development of pmws in conclusion infection with pcv2 caused pmws in spf piglets however the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role #
many of the emerging infectious diseases including those caused by bioterrorist agents are zoonoses since zoonoses can infect both animals and humans the medical and veterinary communities should work closely together in clinical public health and research settings in the clinical setting input from both professions would improve assessments of the risk-benefit ratios of pet ownership particularly for pet owners who are immunocompromised in public health human and animal disease surveillance systems are important in tracking and controlling zoonoses such as avian influenza virus west nile virus and foodborne pathogens comparative medicine is the study of disease processes across species including humans physician and veterinarian comparative medicine research teams should be promoted and encouraged to study zoonotic agent-host interactions these efforts would increase our understanding of how zoonoses expand their host range and would ultimately improve prevention and control strategies emerging infectious diseases • www cdc gov/eid • vol 12 no 4
the indian subcontinent with its population density climatic conditions means of subsistence socioeconomic factors as well as travel and tourism presents a fertile ground for thriving of rna viruses despite being pathogens of huge significance there is very little focus on research into the biology and pathogenesis of rna viruses in india studies on epidemiology and disease burden risk factors the immune response to rna viruses circulating virus strains and virus evolution animal models of disease antivirals and vaccines are strikingly absent emerging rna viruses such as zika virus nipah virus and crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus are a matter of grave concern to india here we summarize the outcome of the india|embo symposium on "rna viruses immunology pathogenesis and translational opportunities" organized at faridabad national capital region india on march 28-30 2018 the meeting focused on rna viruses non-hiv and both national and international experts on rna viruses covered topics ranging from epidemiology immune response virus evolution and vaccine trials concerning rna viruses the aim of the symposium was to create a road map for rna virus research in india both concrete and tentative ideas pointing towards short-term and long-term goals were presented with recommendations for follow-up at government level
to obtain information about the occurrence and genotype distribution of g intestinalis and c parvum in austrian cattle faecal samples from diarrhoeic calves younger than 180 days of age originating from 70 farms were examined of the 177 faecal samples 27.1% were positive for giardia cysts immunofluorescence microscopy and 55.4% for cryptosporidium oocysts phase-contrast microscopy positive samples were characterized by nested pcr for giardia 83.3% triosephosphate isomerase tpi and 89.6% β-giardin bg were positive while the cryptosporidium nested pcr returned 92.5% 60-kda glycoprotein positive results sequence analysis revealed one assemblage a-positive sample and 30 bg respectively 29 tpi assemblage e-positive samples for g intestinalis for c parvum four subtypes within the iia family iiaa15g2r1 n = 29 iiaa19g2r2 n = 3 iiaa21g2r1 n = 2 iiaa14g1r1 n = 1 could be differentiated validation of two immunochromatographic point-of-care tests resulted in a sensitivity of 29.2% and 77.6% a specificity of 98.4% and 91.1% for the detection of giardia intestinalis and cryptosporidium parvum respectively results confirm the widespread occurrence of both protozoa in diarrhoeic calves in austria
foot-and-mouth disease fmd is a highly contagious disease affecting ruminants and pigs in countries in which control of fmd relies predominantly on vaccination young stock ingest specific anti-fmd virus antibodies in the colostrum this maternally-derived antibody mda provides immediate protection against infection with fmd virus but also interferes with the development of active immunity following vaccination however susceptibility to infection precedes the ability to respond to vaccination in the presence of mda currently available vaccines cannot overcome this inhibitory effect of mda and protection of young stock can only be provided by their isolation from fmd virus
the epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars posed a worldwide threat to public health and economic stability although the pandemic has been contained concerns over its recurrence remain it is essential to identify specific diagnostic agents and antiviral vaccine candidates to fight this highly contagious disease methods we generated 14 monoclonal antibodies mabs specific to the sars coronavirus sars-cov nucleocapsid n protein and used these to thoroughly map the n protein antigenic determinants we identified the immunodominant antigenic sites responsible for the antibodies in sera from sars patients and antisera from small animals and differentiated the linear from the conformational antibody-combining sites comprising the natural epitopes by use of yeast surface display results we identified 5 conformational and 3 linear epitopes within the entire n protein 3 conformational and 3 linear epitopes were immunodominant the antibody responses to the n protein fragments in mammalian sera revealed that 3 regions of the n protein are strong antigenic domains we expanded the specificity of the n protein epitope and identified 4 novel confor-mational epitopes amino acids 1-69 68 -213 212-341 and 337-422 conclusion the antigenic structures identified for the sars-cov n protein the epitope-specific mabs and the serum antibody profile in sars patients have potential use in the clinical diagnosis and understanding of the protective immunity to sars-cov
viral hemorrhagic fevers vhf are a group of clinically similar diseases that can be caused by enveloped rna viruses primarily from the families arenaviridae filoviridae hantaviridae and flaviviridae clinically this group of diseases has in common fever fatigue dizziness muscle aches and other associated symptoms that can progress to vascular leakage bleeding and multi-organ failure most of these viruses are zoonotic causing asymptomatic infections in the primary host but in human beings the infection can be lethal clinical and experimental evidence suggest that the t-cell response is needed for protection against vhf but can also cause damage to the host and play an important role in disease pathogenesis here we present a review of the t-cell immune responses to vhf and insights into the possible ways to improve counter-measures for these viral agents
the common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the callitrichidae family weighing between 350 and 400g the marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding model for studying aging reproduction neuroscience toxicology and infectious disease with regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents they are exquisite nhp models for viral protozoan and bacterial agents as well as prions the marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and susceptibility to wild type non-adapted viruses
the tick is a well-known vector for arthropod-borne pathogens such as tick-borne encephalitis lyme disease japanese spotted fever and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome it is therefore important to know the tick population and distribution in our environment and wild animals in order to prevent tick-borne diseases here we report the results of tick surveillance from may to september 2011 at 14 geographical points and in 5 wild boars in kyoto city kyoto prefecture japan we collected 3198 ticks comprising 5 tick species haemaphysalis h longicornis h flava h kitaokai amblyomma testudinarium and dermacentor taiwanensis interestingly the proportion of tick species varied according to geographical region within the city the ticks collected in the city were reported as potential vectors of pathogens such as rickettsiosis we detected rickettsial dna by pcr in 71.1% of 201 ticks investigated the ticks that carried rickettsiae were distributed across the whole the city the sequences of pcr-amplified dna fragments were determined and showed similarities to spotted fever group rickettsiae although their pathogenicity for animals including humans is still unclear it is important to stay alert and pay attention to tick-borne diseases in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors
although vesicular stomatitis virus vsv neurovirulence and pathogenicity in rodents have been well studied little is known about vsv pathogenicity in non-human primates to address this question we measured vsv viremia shedding and neurovirulence in macaques following intranasal inoculation macaques shed minimal recombinant vsv rvsv in nasal washes for one day post-inoculation viremia was not detected following intranasal inoculation of macaques wild type wt vsv rvsv and two rvsv-hiv vectors showed no evidence of spread to cns tissues however macaques inoculated intrathalamically with wt vsv developed severe neurological disease one of four macaques receiving rvsv developed clinical and histological signs similar to the wt group while the remaining three macaques in this group and all of the macaques in the rvsv-hiv vector groups showed no clinical signs of disease and reduced severity of histopathology compared to the wt group the implications of these findings for rvsv vaccine development are discussed
many new and emerging rna and dna viruses are zoonotic or have zoonotic origins in an animal reservoir that is usually mammalian and sometimes avian not all zoonotic viruses are transmissible directly or by an arthropod vector between human hosts virus genome sequence data provide the best evidence of transmission of human transmissible virus 37 species have so far been restricted to self-limiting outbreaks these viruses are priorities for surveillance because relatively minor changes in their epidemiologies can potentially lead to major changes in the threat they pose to public health on the basis of comparisons across all recognized human viruses we consider the characteristics of these priority viruses and assess the likelihood that they will further emerge in human populations we also assess the likelihood that a virus that can infect humans but is not capable of transmission directly or by a vector between human hosts can acquire that capability
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is the most common diarrhea-causing pathogen in newborn piglets the clarifications of the overall antibody repertoire and antigen-specific antibody repertoire are essential to provide important insights into the b-cell response and reshape new vaccines here we applied next-generation sequencing ngs technology to investigate immunoglobulin ig variable v gene segment usage of swine b-cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes pbl and mesenteric lymph node mln cells following pedv vaccination we identified the transcripts of all functional ig v-genes in antibody repertoire ighv1s2 igkv1-11 and iglv3-4 were the most prevalent gene segments for heavy kappa and lambda chains respectively in pbl and mln unlike previous studies igkv1 instead of igkv2 and iglv3 instead of iglv8 were the prevalent ig v-gene families for kappa and lambda light chains respectively we further examined the antibody repertoire of pedv spike-specific b cells by single-cell rt-pcr in contrast to the overall antibody repertoire ig v-gene segments of pedv spike-specific b cells preferentially adopted ighv1-4 and ighv1-14 for heavy chain igkv1-11 for kappa chain and iglv3-3 for lambda chain these results represent a comprehensive analysis to characterize the ig v-gene segment usage in the overall and pedv spike-specific antibody repertoire in pbl and mln porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv next-generation sequencing ngs single-cell rt-pcr antibody repertoire citation li r fu f feng l and liu p h 2019 next-generation sequencing and single-cell rt-pcr reveal a distinct variable gene usage of porcine antibody repertoire following pedv vaccination sci china life sci 62 https//doi
malaria is a reemerging disease in the countries where it was eradicated previously whereas it is endemic in many countries including tropical countries in india malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities the incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines this review focuses on commonly seen immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection resulting in related humoral and cell mediated immune functions primarily with innate to subsequent adaptive immunity in tackling this parasitic infection
experimental evidence has shown that antibody responses to west nile virus wnv are critical for protection from wnv-mediated disease antibody responses are also an important immune correlate of protection for the clinical evaluation of wnv vaccines however little direct study has been carried out on the characteristics of the human antibody response to natural wnv infection preliminary evidence suggests that there are important differences in the way humans and experimental animals mount humoral responses to wnv in humans igm is remarkably persistent in the serum and specific igg is slow to appear in addition mapping of the igg response to the functionally relevant e-protein suggests that it directed away from critical protective epitopes and towards weakly neutralizing immunodominant epitopes these findings have important implications for vaccine design and testing
vaccination is one of the cheapest health-care interventions that have saved more lives than any other drugs or therapies due to successful immunization programs we rarely hear about some of the common diseases of the early twentieth century including small pox and polio vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry cattle and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines currently there are no vaccines for cancer neurodegenerative diseases autoimmune diseases as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis aids and parasitic diseases including malaria abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms changes in climate is another concern for vaccinologists climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines use of conventional vaccination strategies to develop vaccines has severe limitations hence innovative strategies are essential in the development of novel and effective vaccines
several ebola vaccines and therapeutics are under clinical development however limited knowledge exists on the quality of antibody response generated by different ebola vaccines in this study antibody repertoire induced by vaccination of transchromosomal bovine tcb with ebola virus ebov glycoprotein recombinant gp encoded by either deoxyribonucleic acid dna or nanoparticle-based vaccine platform was analyzed using ebov genome fragment phage display library and surface plasmon resonance spr-based real-time kinetics assay to measure antibody affinity maturation to both native and partially denatured ebola gp as well as gp containing the receptor binding domain but lacking the mucin-like domain immunoglobulin igg obtained from rgp nanoparticle-vaccinated tcb demonstrated ~4-fold higher binding affinity compared with dna-vaccinated tcb-induced igg against the native rgp's the rgp nanoparticle vaccine generated a more robust and diverse antibody immune response to the native ebov-gp compared with the dna vaccine which may explain the protective efficacy observed for these antibody preparations
the aim of this study is to reveal infection dynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 pi-3 bovine herpesvirus 1 bhv-1 bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv bovine adenovirus type 3 bav-3 and bovine coronavirus bcov which are important viral pathogens of respiratory disease complex in ruminants through such an analysis the regression period of maternally derived antibodies and optimum vaccination time in calves can be recommended a total of 10 farms were grouped as large 4- medium 2-and small 4-sized enterprises according to their animal population newborn calves n 94 delivered during a calendar month on the farms were studied blood samples were collected from these calves during their 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th months of age blood samples were also taken from their dams during the first sampling neutralizing antibody titers were detected using the serum neutralization test sn 50 . new pi-3 and bvdv infections at the early stages of life were determined in the calves maternal antibodies began to decrease in the 2nd month for brsv bhv-1 and bav-3 97.8% 25.5% and 91.4% and in the 3rd month for pi-3 bvdv and bcov 85.1% 67% and 93.6%. it was concluded that maternal antibodies begin to decrease after the 1st month and that the possible first exposure of calves to respiratory viruses is after the 2nd month therefore it is recommended that the first vaccination program including prime and booster doses can be applied between 2 and 4 months of age furthermore re-vaccination of animals at 6 months after the booster dose is also suggested
antibody repertoires for library construction are conventionally harvested from mrnas of immune cells to examine whether germline rearranged immunoglobulin ig variable region genes could be used as source of antibody repertoire an immunized phage-displayed scfv library was prepared using splenocytic genomic dna as template in addition a novel frame-shifting pcr fspcr step was introduced to rescue stop codon and to enhance diversity of the complementaritydetermining region 3 cdr3 the germline scfv library was initially characterized against the hapten antigen phenyloxazolone phox sequence analysis of the phox-selective scfvs indicated that the cdrs consisted of novel as well as conserved motifs in order to illustrate that the diversity of cdr3 was increased by the fspcr step a second scfv library was constructed using a single scfv clone l3g7c as a template despite showing similar binding characteristics towards phox the scfv clones that were obtained from the l3g7c-derived antibody library gave a lower non-specific binding than that of the parental l3g7c clone to determine whether germline library represented the endogenous immune status specific scfv clones for nucleocapsid n protein of sars-associated coronavirus scov were obtained both from naïve and immunized germline scfv libraries both libraries yielded specific anti-n scfvs that exhibited similar binding characteristics towards recombinant n protein except the immunized library gave a larger number of specific anti-n scfv and clones with identical nucleotide sequences were found in conclusion highly diversified antibody library can be efficiently constructed using germline rearranged immunoglobulin variable genes as source of antibody repertoires and fspcr to diversify the cdr3
migratory birds are potential transmitters of bacterial antibiotic resistance however their role in the environmental dissemination of bacterial antibiotic resistance and the extent of their impact on the environment are not yet clear qinghai lake is one of the most important breeding and stopover ground for the migratory birds along the central asian flyway here we investigated the bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment and among the migratory birds around the lake the results of culture-based analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistance quantitative pcr and metagenomic sequencing indicate that migratory birds are one major source of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the environment around qinghai lake network analysis reveals the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial genera genetic co-localization analysis suggests high co-selection potential with incidence of 35.8% among different args but limited linkage with incidence journal pre-proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 2 of only 3.7% between args and biocide/metal resistance genes bmrgs the high genetic linkage between args and mobile genetic elements mges is still largely confined to the bacterial community in migratory birds accounting for 96.0% of sequencing reads of mge-linked args which indicates limited horizontal transfer of args to the environment nevertheless the antibiotic resistance determinants carried by migratory birds and their specific genetic properties high co-selection and mobility potential of the args remind us that the role of migratory birds in the environmental dissemination of bacterial antibiotic resistance deserves more attention
numerous viruses mostly in mixed infections have been associated worldwide with poult enteritis complex pec in 2008 a coronavirus fr-tcov 080385d was isolated in france from turkey poults exhibiting clinical signs compatible with this syndrome in the present study the median infectious dose id 50 transmission kinetics and pathogenicity of fr-tcov were investigated in 10-day-old spf turkeys results revealed a titre of 10 4.88 id 50 /ml with 1 id 50 /ml being beyond the limit of genome detection using a well-characterized qrt-pcr for avian coronaviruses horizontal transmission of the virus via the airborne route was not observed however via the oro-faecal route this proved to be extremely rapid one infectious individual infecting another every 2.5 hr and infectious virus was excreted for at least 6 weeks in several birds histological examination of different zones of the intestinal tract of the fr-tcov-infected turkeys showed that the virus had a preference for the lower part of the intestinal tract with an abundance of viral antigen being present in epithelial cells of the ileum caecum and bursa of fabricius viral antigen was also detected in dendritic cells monocytes and macrophages in these areas which may indicate a potential for fr-tcov to replicate in antigen-presenting cells together these results highlight the importance of good sanitary practices in turkey farms to avoid introducing minute amounts of virus that could suffice to initiate an outbreak and the need to consider that infected individuals may still be infectious long after a clinical episode to avoid virus dissemination through the movements of apparently recovered birds coronavirus histopathology transmission turkeys
standard inactivated influenza vaccines are poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive healthy young children who are particularly vulnerable to complications from influenza for them there is an unmet need for better influenza vaccines oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are promising candidates but clinical trials yielded inconsistent results here we meta-analyze randomized controlled trials with efficacy data 3 trials n = 15310 and immunogenicity data 17 trials n = 9062 compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts adjuvanted influenza vaccines provide a significantly better protection weighted estimate for risk ratio of rt-pcr-confirmed influenza 0.26 and are significantly more immunogenic weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratio 4.6 to 7.9 in healthy immunologically naive young children nevertheless in immunologically non-naive children adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and are similarly immunogenic these results indicate that oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant improves the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in healthy young children at the first-time seasonal influenza vaccination
hantaviruses cause life-threatening diseases in human worldwide rodents insectivores and bats are known hantaviral reservoirs but lack of complete genomic sequences of bat-borne hantaviruses impedes phylogenetic and evolutionary comparison with those of rodents and insectivores here a novel batborne hantavirus laibin virus lbv has been identified in a black-bearded tomb bat in china the complete genomic sequence shows that lbv is only distantly related to all previously known bat-borne hantaviruses

the prevalence of preexisting immunity to adenoviruses in the majority of the human population might adversely impact the development of adaptive immune responses against adenovirus vector-based vaccines to address this issue we primed balb/c mice either intranasally i n or intramuscularly i m with varying doses of wild type wt human adenovirus subtype 5 had5 following the development of immunity against had5 we immunized animals via the i n or i m route of inoculation with a had vector had-ha-np expressing the hemagglutinin ha and nucleoprotein np of a/vietnam/1203/ 04 h5n1 influenza virus the immunogenicity and protection results suggest that low levels of vector immunity 520 virus-neutralization titer induced by priming mice with up to 10 7 plaque forming units p f u of had-wt did not adversely impact the protective efficacy of the vaccine furthermore high levels of vector immunity approximately 1500 virusneutralization titer induced by priming mice with 10 8 p f u of had-wt were overcome by either increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination a further increase in the priming dose to 10 9 p f u allowed only partial protection these results suggest possible strategies to overcome the variable levels of human immunity against adenoviruses leading to better utilization of had vector-based vaccines

several human monoclonal antibodies hmabs including b12 2g12 and 2f5 exhibit relatively potent and broad hiv-1-neutralizing activity however their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein env has not been successful we have hypothesized that hiv-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using ''holes" absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response in the human germline b cell receptor bcr repertoire to begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12 2g12 and 2f5 as well as to x5 m44 and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively modest neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects the germline-like x5 m44 and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested envs in contrast germline-like b12 2g12 and 2f5 lacked measurable binding to envs in an elisa assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did these results provide initial evidence that env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of x5 m44 m46 and other antibodies that bind germline bcrs with much higher affinity/avidity this hypothesis if further supported by data could contribute to our understanding of how hiv-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens published by elsevier inc

the use of adenovirus ad as vaccine vectors is hindered by pre-existing immunity to human ads in most of the human population in order to overcome this limitation uncommon alternative ad serotypes need to be utilized in this study an e1-e3 deleted recombinant ad based on the chimpanzee serotype 3 chad3 was engineered to express human carcinoembryonic antigen cea protein or rat neu extracellular/transmembrane domains ecd tm chad3 vectors were tested in cea transgenic cea tg and balb/neut mice which show immunologic tolerance to these antigens chad3 is capable of inducing an immune response comparable to that of had5 serotype-based vectors thus breaking tolerance to tumor associated antigens taas and achieving anti-tumor effects of importance is that chad3 can overcome had5 pre-existing immunity and work in conjunction with dna electroporation dna-ep and other ad vaccines based on common human serotypes
bats are natural reservoir hosts to a variety of viruses many of which cause morbidity and mortality in other mammals currently there is a paucity of information regarding the nature of the immune response to viral infections in bats partly due to a lack of appropriate bat specific reagents ifnc plays a key role in controlling viral replication and coordinating a response for long term control of viral infection here we describe the cloning and expression of ifnc from the australian flying fox pteropus alecto and the generation of mouse monoclonal and chicken egg yolk antibodies specific to bat ifnc our results demonstrate that p alecto ifnc is conserved with ifnc from other species and is induced in bat splenocytes following stimulation with t cell mitogens p alecto ifnc has antiviral activity on semliki forest virus in cell lines from p alecto and the microbat tadarida brasiliensis additionally recombinant bat ifnc was able to mitigate hendra virus infection in p alecto cells these results provide the first evidence for an antiviral role for bat ifnc in vitro in addition to the application of important immunological reagents for further studies of bat antiviral immunity crown
there are more herbivorous waterfowl swans and geese close to humans livestock and poultry than ever before this creates widespread conflict with agriculture and other human interests but also debate about the role of swans and geese as potential vectors of disease of relevance for human and animal health using a one health perspective we provide the first comprehensive review of the scientific literature about the most relevant viral bacterial and unicellular pathogens occurring in wild geese and swans research thus far suggests that these birds may play a role in transmission of avian influenza virus salmonella campylobacter and antibiotic resistance on the other hand at present there is no evidence that geese and swans play a role in transmission of newcastle disease duck plague west nile virus vibrio yersinia clostridium chlamydophila and borrelia finally based on present knowledge it is not possible to say if geese and swans play a role in transmission of escherichia coli pasteurella helicobacter brachyspira cryptosporidium giardia and microsporidia this is largely due to changes in classification and taxonomy rapid development of identification methods and lack of knowledge about host specificity previous research tends to overrate the role of geese and swans as disease vectors we do not find any evidence that they are significant transmitters to humans or livestock of any of the pathogens considered in this review nevertheless it is wise to keep poultry and livestock separated from small volume waters used by many wild waterfowl but there is no need to discourage livestock grazing in nature reserves or pastures where geese and swans are present under some circumstances it is warranted to discourage swans and geese from using wastewater ponds drinking water reservoirs and public beaches intensified screening of swans and geese for aiv west nile virus and anatid herpesvirus is warranted article history
fifteen 6-week-old crossbred weaners weighing about 12 kg each were randomly divided into three groups of five animals each one group of pigs was inoculated first with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs virus and then 3 days later with csf virus the second group received classical swine fever csf virus while the third group was inoculated with prrs virus only the aim of the experiment was to determine whether a primary prrs virus infection influences the clinical outcome of experimentally induced csf in young pigs the prrs virus infected weaners developed mild respiratory symptoms and recovered completely all five weaners which were inoculated with csf virus only showed severe clinical signs typical of the acute form of csf one pig had to be killed 15 days post-inoculation p i the remaining four died between the 18th and 22nd day p i the clinical course of the animals inoculated with both viruses was slightly different from that of the pigs that received only csf virus four out of five pigs from the prrs/csf group became febrile and viraemic earlier than the animals which received csf virus only these pigs had to be killed 15-17 days post csf virus inoculation one animal in this group survived the acute phase of csf and recovered completely it was concluded that the observed divergences of the clinical courses would not have been noticed under field conditions therefore these findings cast doubt on the relevance of prrs virus infection potentiating significantly the clinical outcome of csf in young pigs
the successful use of any adenoviral vectors is predicated upon the use of a serotype that is not neutralized by circulating antibodies however efforts to develop a diverse repertoire of serologically distinct adenovirus vectors may be hindered by the necessity to generate cell lines to allow for the successful propagation of vectors deleted of essential genes a strategy to construct chimeric adenoviruses whereby the rescue and propagation of an e1 deleted hadv-b -derived adenoviral vector can be achieved using existing cell lines such as hek 293 is reported it is further shown that this strategy may be more widely applicable
background in addition to seasonal influenza viruses recently circulating in humans avian influenza viruses aivs of h5n1 h5n6 and h7n9 subtypes have also emerged and demonstrated human infection abilities with high mortality rates although influenza viral infections are usually diagnosed using viral isolation and serological/ molecular analyses the cost accessibility and availability of these methods may limit their utility in various settings
background in endemic areas of zoonotic leishmaniosis caused by l infantum early detection of leishmania infection in dogs is essential to control the dissemination of the parasite to humans the aim of this study was to evaluate the serological and/or molecular diagnostic performance of minimally and non-invasive samples conjunctiva cells cs and peripheral blood pb for monitoring leishmania infection/exposure to phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antigens in dogs at the beginning and the end of sand fly seasonal activity may and october respectively and to assess associated risks factors a total of 208 sheltered dogs from endemic areas of leishmaniosis were screened leishmania dna detection in pb on filter paper and cs was performed by nested-pcr npcr while the detection of anti-leishmania antibodies was performed using ifat and elisa the exposure to p perniciosus salivary antigens sgh rsp01 and rsp03b + rsp01 was measured by elisa results ninety-seven 46.6% and 116 55.8% of the 208 dogs were positive to leishmania antibodies or dna by at least one test at the beginning and end of the sand fly season respectively ifat and elisa presented a substantial agreement in the serodiagnosis of leishmaniosis discrepant pb npcr results were obtained between sampling points leishmania dna was detected in cs of 72 dogs at the end of the phlebotomine season the presence of antibodies to the parasite measured by elisa was significantly higher in dogs presenting clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis at both sampling points phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antibodies were detected in 179 86.1% and 198 95.2% of the screened dogs at the beginning and end of the phlebotomine season respectively the association between elisa positivity and clinical signs suggests its usefulness to confirm a clinical suspicion cs npcr seems to be an effective and non-invasive method for assessing early exposure to the parasite pb npcr should not be used as the sole diagnostic tool to monitor leishmania infection the correlation between the levels of antibodies to p perniciosus saliva and leishmania antibodies suggests the use of a humoral response to sand fly salivary antigens as biomarkers of l infantum infection

adenoviruses are dna viruses that infect a number of vertebrate hosts and are associated with both sporadic and epidemic disease in humans we previously identified a novel adenovirus titi monkey adenovirus tmadv as the cause of a fulminant pneumonia outbreak in a colony of titi monkeys callicebus cupreus at a national primate center in 2009 serological evidence of infection by tmadv was also found in a human researcher at the facility and household family member raising concerns for potential cross-species transmission of the virus here we present experimental evidence of cross-species tmadv infection in common marmosets callithrix jacchus nasal inoculation of a cell cultured-adapted tmadv strain into three marmosets produced an acute mild respiratory illness characterized by low-grade fever reduced activity anorexia and sneezing an increase in virus-specific neutralization antibody titers accompanied the development of clinical signs although serially collected nasal swabs were positive for tmadv for at least 8 days all 3 infected marmosets spontaneously recovered by day 12 post-inoculation and persistence of the virus in tissues could not be established thus the pathogenesis of experimental inoculation of tmadv in common marmosets resembled the mild self-limiting respiratory infection typically seen in immunocompetent human hosts rather than the rapidly progressive fatal pneumonia observed in 19 of 23 titi monkeys during the prior 2009 outbreak these findings further establish the potential for adenovirus crossspecies transmission and provide the basis for development of a monkey model useful for assessing the zoonotic potential of adenoviruses
the evolutionary history of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 pmv1 which includes the agents of newcastle disease nd is characterized by a series of strain emergence events since viruses in this family were first recognized in the 1920s despite the importance of nd to the poultry industry little is known about pmv1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains the genotype vi-pmv1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 ppmv1 because of unusual host specificity with columbiformes collins et al 1996 it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time here we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary pmv1 lineage we demonstrate that gvi-pmv1 arose through cross-species transmission events from galliformes i e chicken to columbiformes and quickly established in pigeon populations our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus the virus appeared first in southeastern europe and quickly spread across the european continent which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination with new viral gene sequences we show that gvi-pmv1 viruses currently circulating in north america resulted from multiple invasion events from europe one associated with an exotic european columbiformes species and that extant lineages have diversified locally this study extends our understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent to cross-species transmission and dispersal patterns of newly emerged avian viruses which may improve surveillance awareness and disease control of this and other important avian pathogens
infectious bronchitis ib and newcastle disease nd are two major infectious diseases that are a threat to the domestic poultry industry in this study we successfully generated a recombinant lasota candidate vaccine strain rndv-ibv-t/b which expresses a short synthetic previously identified ibv s1 multi-epitope cassette using the reverse genetic system the recombinant virus was propagated in nine-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 20 passages and genetic stability was confirmed by whole genome dna sequencing the recombinant virus had a hemagglutination ha titer of 2 10 mean death time mdt of 118 hours and intracerebral pathogenicity index icpi of 0.05 none of these were significantly different from the parental newcastle disease virus ndv lasota strain p > 0.05 vaccination of white leghorn chickens at one day of age with 10 6 eid 50 rndv-ibv-t/b provided 90% protection against virulent ibv m41 challenge at three weeks of age which was significantly higher than the protection of the control group vaccinated with phosphate-buffered saline pbs p < 0.05 the ciliostasis scores of rndv-ibv-t/b-vaccinated and lasota-vaccinated groups were 4.2 and 37.6 respectively which indicated that rndv-ibv-t/b vaccination reduced the pathogenicity of ibv toward the trachea furthermore real-time rt-pcr assay showed that the rndv-ibv-t/b vaccination resulted in low levels of viral load 647.80 ± 49.65 rna copies in the trachea four days post-challenge which is significantly lower than groups vaccinated with pbs 8591.25 ± 311.10 rna copies or lasota 7742.60 ± 298.50 rna copies p < 0.05 meanwhile the same dose of rndv-ibv-t/b vaccination provided complete protection against velogenic ndv f48e9 challenge these results demonstrate that the rndv-ibv-t/b strain is a promising vaccine candidate to control both ib and nd simultaneously furthermore epitope-based live vector vaccines provide an alternative strategy for the development of cost-effective and broadly cross-protective vaccines
porcine epidemic diarrhea a disastrous gastrointestinal disease causes great financial losses due to its high infectivity morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets despite the development and application of various vaccines in this study high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv the results revealed that the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with pedv showed low diversity and was dominated by proteobacteria 49.1%. additionally the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with pedv showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets some of the taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with pedv were associated with cellular transport and catabolism energy metabolism the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites and amino acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on the bacterial 16s rrna gene therefore adjusting the intestinal microbiota might be a promising method for the prevention or treatment of pedv
dogs represent the most important domestic reservoir of l chagasi syn l infantum a vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible l chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis vl because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily codeposited during transmission of leishmania parasites their inclusion in an anti-leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades we investigated the immunogenicity of the "lbsapsal" vaccine l braziliensis antigens saponin as adjuvant and lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract in dogs at baseline t 0 during the post-vaccination protocol t 3rd and after early t 90 and late t 885 times following l chagasi-challenge our major data indicated that immunization with "lbsapsal" is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type i tumor necrosis factor -α interleukin -12 interferon -γ cytokines and reduction in type ii cytokines il-4 and tgf-β even after experimental challenge the establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after "lbsapsal" immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism 78.9% and indicating long-lasting protection against l chagasi infection in conclusion these results confirmed the hypothesis that the "lbsapsal" vaccination is a potential tool to control the leishmania chagasi infection
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was identified in the united states u s swine population for the first time in april 2013 and rapidly spread nationwide however no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose mid of pedv in different pig models the main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of pedv in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs a u s virulent pedv prototype isolate usa/in19338/2013 with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 tcid 50 /ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated 10ml/pig into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs n = 4 per group and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs n = 6 per group in 5-day-old pigs 10ml of inoculum having titers 560-0.056 tcid 50 /ml corresponding to polymerase chain reaction pcr cycle threshold ct values 24.2-37.6 resulted in 100% infection in each group 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 tcid 50 /ml ct>45 caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs in 21-day-old pigs 10ml of inoculum with titers 560-5.6 tcid 50 /ml ct 24.2-31.4 resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56-0.0056 tcid 50 /ml ct values 35.3 ->45 did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs pcr histopathology immunohistochemistry and antibody response these data reveal that pedv infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower mid for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs this information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of pedv pcr results and when designing a pedv bioassay model the observation of such a low mid in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms
an acute outbreak of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev infection in piglets characterized with neurological symptoms vomiting diarrhea and wasting occurred in china coronavirus-like particles were observed in the homogenized tissue suspensions of the brain of dead piglets by electron microscopy and a wild phev strain was isolated characterized and designated as phev-cc14 histopathologic examinations of the dead piglets showed characteristics of nonsuppurative encephalitis and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic and neuronophagia similarly mice inoculated with phev-cc14 were found to have central nervous system cns dysfunction with symptoms of depression arched waists standing and vellicating front claws furthmore phev-positive labeling of neurons in cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported the viral infections of the nervous system then the major structural genes of phev-cc14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed and the strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identity with the other phev strains available in genbank phylogenetic analysis clearly proved that the wild strain clustered into a subclass with a hev-jt06 strain these findings suggested that the virus had a strong tropism for cns in this way inducing nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets simultaneously the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed a certain variation among the phev strains currently circulating around the world above all the information presented in this study can not only provide good reference for the experimental diagnosis of phev infection for pig breeding but also promote its new effective vaccine development ae enjuanes l 2003 a comparative sequence analysis to revise the current taxonomy of the family coronaviridae
bats in the eu have been associated with several zoonotic viral pathogens of significance to both human and animal health virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare interest in these viruses remains through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis-rabies the association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest much of the eu is free of terrestrial rabies but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally novel related viruses continue to be discovered predominantly in bat populations that are of interest purely through their classification within the lyssavirus genus alongside the rabies virus although the rabies virus is principally transmitted from the bite of infected dogs these related lyssaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans and terrestrial carnivores by bats even though reports of zoonotic viruses from bats within the eu are rare to protect human and animal health it is important characterise novel bat viruses for several reasons namely i to investigate the mechanisms for the maintenance potential routes of transmission and resulting clinical signs if any in their natural hosts ii to investigate the ability of existing vaccines where available to protect against these viruses iii to evaluate the potential for spill over and onward transmission of viral pathogens in novel terrestrial hosts this review is an update on the current situation regarding zoonotic virus discovery within bats in the eu and provides details of potential future mechanisms to control the threat from these deadly pathogens
hepatitis e virus hev causes epidemic and sporadic cases of hepatitis worldwide hev genotypes 3 hev3 and 4 hev4 infect humans and animals with swine being the primary reservoir the relevance of hev genetic diversity to host adaptation is poorly understood we employed a bayesian network bn analysis of hev3 and hev4 to detect epistatic connectivity among protein sites and its association with the host specificity in each genotype the data imply coevolution among ~70% of polymorphic sites from all hev proteins and association of numerous coevolving sites with adaptation to swine or humans bn models for individual proteins and domains of the nonstructural polyprotein detected the host origin of hev strains with accuracy of 74-93% and 63-87% respectively these findings taken together with lack of phylogenetic association to host suggest that the hev host specificity is a heritable and convergent phenotypic trait achievable through variety of genetic pathways abundance and explain a broad host range for hev3 and hev4
continuous efforts have been made to develop a prophylactic vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in this study two recombinant baculoviruses vac-n and vac-s were constructed which contained the mammalian-cell activate promoter element human elongation factor 1␣-subunit ef-1␣ the human cytomegalovirus cmv immediate-early promoter and the nucleocapsid n or spike s gene of bat sars-like cov sl-cov under the control of the cmv promoter mice were subcutaneously and intraperitoneally injected with recombinant baculovirus and both humoral and cellular immune responses were induced in the vaccinated groups the secretion level of ifn-␥ was much higher than that of il-4 in vac-n or vac-s immunized groups suggesting a strong th1 bias towards cellular immune responses additionally a marked increase of cd4 t cell immune responses and high levels of anti-sars-cov humoral responses were also detected in the vac-n or vac-s immunized groups in contrast there were significantly weaker cellular immune responses as well as less antibody production than in the control groups our data demonstrates that the recombinant baculovirus can serve as an effective vaccine strategy in addition because effective sars vaccines should act to not only prevent the reemergence of sars-cov but also to provide cross-protection against sl-cov findings in this study may have implications for developing such cross-protective vaccines
virus-like particles vlps are a class of subunit vaccines that differentiate themselves from soluble recombinant antigens by stronger protective immunogenicity associated with the vlp structure like parental viruses vlps can be either non-enveloped or enveloped and they can form following expression of one or several viral structural proteins in a recombinant heterologous system depending on the complexity of the vlp it can be produced in either a prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system using target-encoding recombinant vectors or in some cases can be assembled in cell-free conditions to date a wide variety of vlp-based candidate vaccines targeting various viral bacterial parasitic and fungal pathogens as well as non-infectious diseases have been produced in different expression systems some vlps have entered clinical development and a few have been licensed and commercialized this article reviews vlp-based vaccines produced in different systems their immunogenicity in animal models and their status in clinical development
enterovirus 71 ev71 is responsible for the outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the asia-pacific region to produce the virus-like particle vlp vaccine we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co-express ev71 p1 polypeptide and 3cd protease using the bac-to-bac 1 vector system the recombinant baculoviruses resulted in p1 cleavage by 3cd and subsequent vlp assembly in infected insect cells but caused either low vlp yield or excessive vlp degradation to tackle the problems here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashbac gold tm vector system which was deficient in v-cath and chia genes we found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashbac gold tm system was insufficient to improve the ev71 vlp yield nonetheless bacf-p1-c3cd a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashbac gold tm system to express p1 under the polh promoter and 3cd under the cmv promoter dramatically improved the vlp yield while alleviating the vlp degradation infection of high five tm cells with bacf-p1-c3cd enhanced the total and extracellular vlp yield to %268 and %171 mg/l respectively which enabled the release of abundant vlp into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 mg purified vlp induced cross-protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge given the significantly improved extracellular vlp yield %171 mg/l and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 mg vlp one liter high five tm culture produced %12000 doses of purified vaccine thus rendering the ev71 vlp vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries it was recently introduced for the first time into north america and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within europe as well to assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of pedv infection multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against pedv in an inter-laboratory ring trial different laboratories have used a variety of "in house" elisas and also one commercial assay the sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard although different characteristics were found it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early european strains of pedv or the recently circulating strains indel and non-indel however not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country the results from individual animals especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation show more variation
aims this work aims to characterize the utility of four newly generated monoclonal antibodies mabs against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev methods and results four monoclonal antibodies mabs against the n-terminal half of spike protein s1 protein of tgev were identified affinity constant of these mabs was analysed these mabs were capable of reacting with the tgev s1 protein analysed by elisa and western blot a competition assay between the different mabs was performed to determine whether the different antibodies mapped in the same or a different antigenic region of the protein investigation on the neutralizing ability of these mabs indicated that two of these mabs completely neutralized tgev at an appropriate concentration these mabs were able to detect the tgev-infected cells in immunofluorescence assays and western blot moreover they differentiated tgev s protein from other control proteins conclusions the generated four mabs are very specific and the established immunofluorescence assays western blot and discrimination elisa are useful approaches for detecting of tgev significance and impact of the study it is a novel report regarding the use of the s1 protein of tgev to generate specific mabs their utility and the established immunoassays contribute to the surveillance of tge coronavirus
the work of our laboratory has focused on the study of human memory b cells using an in vitro approach we dissected the triggering requirements of b cells and unveiled a distinct role for tlrs in the activation of naive versus memory b cells using an ex vivo approach we analyzed the dynamics of memory b cells and ascs and the kinetics of serum antibodies during secondary immune responses and in steady state conditions and used these quantitative data to build up a model of serological memory according to this model memory b cells behave as 'stem cells' capable of generating plasma cells and antibodies in an antigen-dependent as well as in an antigen-independent fashion finally we developed an efficient method to interrogate human memory b cells and to isolate human monoclonal antibodies this method can be exploited for the production of neutralizing antibodies for serotherapy and for ''analytic vaccinology''.

much of our current understanding of measles has come from experiments in non-human primates in 1911 goldberger and anderson showed that macaques inoculated with filtered secretions from measles patients developed measles thus demonstrating that the causative agent of this disease was a virus since then different monkey species have been used for experimental measles virus infections moreover infection studies in macaques demonstrated that serial passage of the virus in vivo and in vitro resulted in virus attenuation providing the basis for all current live-attenuated measles vaccines this chapter will review the macaque model for measles with a focus on vaccination and immunopathogenesis studies conducted over the last 15 years in addition recent data are highlighted demonstrating that the application of a recombinant measles virus strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein dramatically increased the sensitivity of virus

in this study 60 pigs with clinical signs of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome pmws from 20 different pig herds and 180 control pigs without clinical signs of pmws were examined to get more insights into the frequencies of porcine circovirus 2 infections and the presence of co-infections in pigs with and without clinical signs of pmws in the netherlands porcine circovirus type 2 was detected in 100% of the pigs with clinical signs of pmws by virus isolation and/or pcr and in 50% of the pigs from pmws-free herds there was an association between the levels of infectious pcv2 and/or pcv2 dna load and the severity of clinical signs as described for pmws a high variation in pcv2 antibody titres was found in the clinically affected pigs and 27% of these pigs did not mount pcv2 antibody titres higher than 1200 a concurrent infection of pcv2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv was found in at least 83% of the pigs with clinical signs of pmws and in 35% of the pigs from pmws-free herds co-infections of european-and american-type prrsv were detected only in pmws herds and in one control herd with a history of pmws clinical signs
recent studies on virus discovery have focused mainly on mammalian and avian viruses arbovirology with its long tradition of ecologically oriented investigation is now catching up with important novel insights into the diversity of arthropodassociated viruses recent discoveries include taxonomically outlying viruses within the families flaviviridae togaviridae and bunyaviridae and even novel virus families within the order nidovirales however the current focusing of studies on bloodfeeding arthropods has restricted the range of arthropod hosts analyzed for viruses so far future investigations should include species from other arthropod taxa than ixodita culicidae and phlebotominae in order to shed light on the true diversity of arthropod viruses

humans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in genetic polymorphisms that affect response to viral infection we conducted a comprehensive study in the uk biobank linking germline genetic variation and gene expression with 28 antigens for 16 viruses in 7924 subjects we discovered 7 novel loci associated with antibody response p<5.0´10 -8 including fut2 for human polyomavirus bkv tmem173for merkel cell polyomavirus mcv and tbkbp1 for human herpesvirus 7 transcriptome-wide analyses identified 114 genes association with response to viral infection including ecscr p=5.0×10 -15 mcv ntn5 p=1.1×10 -9 bkv and p2ry13 p=1.1×10 -8 epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen signals in human leukocyte antigen hla class ii region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families we also link viral response genes with complex diseases such as c4a expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia lastly based on 1028 subjects tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 we identify 7 class ii hla susceptibility alleles 5 associated with other viruses we also observe that genetic determinants of ace2 expression may influence sars-cov-2 susceptibility our findings elucidate the genetic architecture of host response to viral infection with potential implications for complex diseases and covid-19 medrxiv preprint sars-cov-2 were more likely to be smokers 55.1% vs 45.2% had higher mean bmi 28.7 vs 27.4 kg/m 2 higher levels of deprivation based on the townsend index and a higher burden of comorbidities based on the charlson index 1 or more 50.0% vs 29.8%. individuals with at least one positive test result n=669 included a higher proportion of men 56.5% former smokers 43.2% vs 38.3% and self-identified as non-white 15.5% vs 8%. the two groups had similar distributions of other health-related characteristics the final analytic dataset included 443 cases and 585 controls of european ancestry with test results from respiratory samples excluding results from serum or unknown origins results from our gwas of antibody response phenotypes were dominated by signals in the hla region which were detected for all ebv antigens ea-d ebna p18 zebra cmv pp52 hsv1 hhv7 vzv jcv and mcv table 1 supplementary figure 1 . most of the top-ranking hla variants for each antigen were independent of those for other antigens supplementary figure 2 . exceptions were moderate ld between lead variants for ebv zebra and hsv1 r 2 =0.45 ebv ebna and jcv r 2 =0.45 and hhv7 and mcv r 2 =0.44 outside of the hla region genome-wide significant associations with seroreactivity were detected for mcv at 3p24.3 rs776170649 loc339862 p=1.7´10 -8 and 5q31.2 rs7444313 tmem173p=2.4´10 -15 bkv at 19q13.3 rs681343 fut2 p=4.7´10 -15 figure 1 ebv ebna at 3q25
the present study aimed to investigate the frequency of pathogenic leptospira spp in brazilian bats and to determine possible risk factors associated to it ninety two bats of 12 species were evaluated whole genomic dna from kidneys was extracted and real-time pcr specific to pathogenic leptospira spp was applied association between the frequency of specimens positive for leptospira spp and sex age bat species or family season of collection geographic localization and feeding habits was evaluated the results showed that 39.13% of analyzed bats were found positive for leptospira spp nine bat species had at least one positive result there was no association among the evaluated variables and frequency of pathogenic leptospira spp although the limitations due to lack of leptospira spp isolation leptospiral carriage was demonstrated in bats of different species from southern brazil which reinforces the need for surveillance of infectious agents in wild animals

the objective of this study was to assess if lipoteichoic acid lta produced by staphylococcus aureus exacerbates respiratory disease in porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv-infected pigs as has previously been shown with lipopolysaccharide piglets were inoculated with prcv and 24 h later with s aureus lta clinical signs lung virus titres inflammatory cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf were compared with those of animals in prcv-and lta-inoculated control groups all prcv-lta-inoculated pigs except one developed severe respiratory disease whereas clinical signs in the control groups were minimal or absent virus titres and grossly visible pulmonary lesions were similar in the prcv-lta-and prcv-inoculated groups and were not detected in the lta group neutrophil percentages in balf were higher in the prcv-lta than in the prcv group there was no significant difference in interferon ifn-c interleukin il-1 il-6 il-12/il-23 and tumour necrosis factor tnf-a concentrations in balf between the prcv-lta and prcv groups but levels of il-6 il-12/il-23 and ifn-c were higher in the prcv-lta-inoculated than in the lta-inoculated controls the findings suggest that the experimentally-induced respiratory disease was not mediated by cytokine over-production but rather reflected the concerted action of particular cytokine interactions and/ or as yet unidentified mediators this is the first in vivo study to report the synergistic interaction between a virus and lta in enhancing the severity of respiratory disease in the pig given that gram-positive bacteria capable of producing lta are commonly found in pig accommodation the role of this compound in the development of the porcine respiratory disease complex requires further investigation
two new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayes elisa for the diagnosis of babesia boris in cattle are described the elisa using a native antigen is more sensitive and less laborious than the assays described previously because it does not require adsorption of sera with bovine erythrocytes the second elisa using a recombinant b boris antigen expressed in escheriehia coli was both sensitive and specific it is suitable to replace the native antigen thus avoiding large batch-tobatch variations in antigen preparations and the need to sacrifice experimental cattle
a sheep kidney-derived cell line flk-n3 was successfully established after serial >100 passages persistent infection of this cell line with viruses and mycoplasma was not detected the cells grew well and showed susceptibility to a wide variety of viruses derived from ovine bovine and porcine species including orf virus maedi visna virus bovine herpesvirus 1 bovine parainfluenza virus 3 bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2 bovine coronavirus bovine respiratory syncytial virus bovine enterovirus suid herpesvirus 1 and porcine enterovirus these results suggest that the flk-n3 cell line could be useful for isolation and propagation of viruses that affect cloven-hoofed animals
adenoviruses are double-strained dna viruses found in a great number of vertebrates 8 including humans in order to understand their transmission dynamics it is crucial even from a 9 human health perspective to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence bats are 10 important reservoirs for adenoviruses and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 western europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting adenoviruses taking into account their phylogenetic relationships across 13 species we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses 15 across bat species contrary to other more stable mating strategies e g harems swarming could 16 hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short alternatively bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the iberian 19species pipistrellus pygmaeus p kuhlii and nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter 20 males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females due to the 21 immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season as a general trend 22 4 29 author summary 30 adenoviruses are dna viruses with a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans 31 causing ocular respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases here we focus on the prevalence of 32adenoviruses in bats which are known to be natural reservoir of many viruses using the results 33 of recent screenings for prevalence of these viruses in 33 european bat species our aim is to 34 find association between adenoviruses prevalence and biological and behavioral host traits 35 considering the heterogeneity both between and within species in order to have a deeper 36 understanding of mechanisms of viral transmission our results highlight the importance of mating strategy bats species using swarming as mating 38 strategy are less likely to be infected by adenoviruses moreover we found that locality of 39 capture can explain a higher prevalence of adenovirus within species however no general 40 pattern has been found in the analysis at individual level suggesting a strong species specificity 41 and complex viral transmission dynamics 42 43
in leporids il17a had been implicated in the host defense against extracellular pathogens such as francisella tularensis that infects hares and rabbits and causes the zoonotic disease tularemia here we studied il17a from five lagomorphs european rabbit pygmy rabbit brush rabbit european brown hare and american pika we observed that this protein is highly conserved between these species with a similarity of 97-99% in leporids and ∼88% between leporids and american pika the exon/intron structure nglycosylation sites and cysteine residues are conserved between lagomorphs however at codon 88 one of the interaction sites between il17a and its receptor il17ra there is an arg>pro mutation that only occurs in european rabbit and european brown hare this could induce critical alterations in the il17a structure and conformation and consequently modify its function the differences observed between leporids and humans or rodents might also represent important alterations in protein structure and function in addition as for other interleukins il17a sequences of human and european rabbit are more closely related than the sequences of human and mouse or european rabbit and mouse this study gives further support to the hypothesis that european rabbit might be a more suitable animal model for studies on human il17
homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral-or vaccine-induced autoimmunity failure of sars and mers vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the sars and mers spike protein exposure pathogenesis to sars-cov-2 in covid-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides similar to the more diffuse idea of "immune enhancement". here i provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure via infection or injection sar-cov-2 spike proteins and all other sars-cov-2 proteins immunogenic epitopes in each sars-cov-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching only one immunogenic epitope in a sars-cov-2 had no homology to human proteins if all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in covid-19 disease it also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself targeting elements of mhc class i and class ii antigen presentation pd-1 signaling cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the er-phagosome pathway translational consequences of these findings are explored
host shifts where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species are a major source of emerging infectious diseases they frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species to investigate genetic changes in novel hosts we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an rna virus drosophila c virus in 19 different species of drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes we found a strong pattern of parallel evolution where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species when we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related this suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species this may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease host shifts where a pathogen jumps from one host species to another are a major source of infectious disease hosts shifts are more likely to occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host here we have investigated how viruses evolve in different host species by experimentally evolving replicate lineages of an rna virus in 19 different host species that shared a common ancestor 40 million years ago we then deep sequenced the genomes of these viruses to examine the genetic changes that have occurred in different host species that vary in their relatedness we found that parallel mutations-that are indicative of selection-were significantly more likely to occur within viral lineages from the same host and between viruses evolved in closely related species this suggests that a mutation that may adapt a virus to a given host may also adapt it to closely related host species
during the last two decades researchers have developed robust systems for recombinant subunit vaccine production in plants stably and transiently transformed plants have particular advantages that enable immunization of humans and animals via mucosal delivery the initial goal to immunize orally by ingestion of plant-derived antigens has proven difficult to attain although many studies have demonstrated antibody production in both humans and animals and in a few cases protection against pathogen challenge substantial hurdles for this strategy are low-antigen content in crudely processed plant material and limited antigen stability in the gut an alternative is intranasal delivery of purified plant-derived antigens expressed with robust viral vectors especially virus-like particles the use of pattern recognition receptor agonists as adjuvants for mucosal delivery of plant-derived antigens can substantially enhance serum and mucosal antibody responses in this chapter we briefly review the methods for recombinant protein expression in plants and describe progress with human and animal vaccines that use mucosal delivery routes we do not attempt to compile a comprehensive list but focus on studies that progressed to clinical trials or those that showed strong indications of efficacy in animals finally we discuss some regulatory concerns regarding plant-based vaccines
sow's milk is a potential route for the vertical transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv from sow to suckling piglet we report here the complete genome sequence of pedv strain ch/hnyf/2014 which was isolated from milk samples this information provides further understanding of the transmission mechanisms and genetic diversity of pedv
several studies have shown a reduced efficacy of influenza vaccines in the elderly compared to young adults in this study we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a commercially available inactivated influenza vaccine fluzone 1 in young adult and aged mice c57/bl6 mice were administered a single or double immunization of fluzone 1 with or without cpg and challenged intranasally with h1n1 a/california/09 virus a double immunization of fluzone 1 adjuvanted with cpg elicited the highest level of protection in young adult mice which was associated with increases in influenza specific igg elevated hai titres reduced viral titres and lung inflammation in contrast the vaccine schedule which provided fully protective immunity in young adult mice conferred limited protection in aged mice antigen presenting cells from aged mice were found to be less responsive to in vitro stimulation by fluzone and cpg which may partially explain this result our data are supportive of studies that have shown limited effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the elderly and provide important information relevant to the design of more immunogenic vaccines in this age group

the last century has witnessed the emergence of several previously unknown viruses as life-threatening human pathogens several examples include hiv ebola lujo and most recently the middle east respiratory syndrome mers and ebola in this study we describe a method for the swift generation of a humanderived monoclonal antibody known as lca60 as a treatment for mers infections lca60 antibody was generated using the cellclone technology from the immortalized b cells of a human donor recovering from mers only four months were required from the initial screening of b cells to the development of a stable cho cell line suitable for the production of clinical grade antibody thereby delineating a rapid pathway for the development of antiviral therapies against emerging viruses currently the lca60 antibody is being considered for clinical development which includes prophylaxis in individuals at risk and a treatment for severe mers-cov infections
bats belong to the order chiroptera that represents the second largest order of mammals with more than 1200 species and an almost global distribution environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans in recent years bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential as well as a great diversity of astroviruses for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients for a long time astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific however a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers furthermore our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock this review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats humans and livestock especially bovines and pigs future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses
two recently detected viruses human metapneumovirus hmpv and coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 have been associated with acute respiratory tract infections particularly in young children this study investigated the frequency of hmpv and hcov-nl63 infections in swedish children by screening 221 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected between november 2003 and may 2005 from 212 children attending the paediatric department of a county hospital in sweden or submitted from local general practitioners the samples were originally submitted to be tested for respiratory syncytial virus rsv and were examined retrospectively for hmpv and hcov-nl63 by rt-pcr of the 212 patients 101 were positive for rsv 48% 22 10% were positive for hmpv and 12 6% were positive for hcov-nl63 the frequency of hcov-nl63 infection increased from 1% in 2003-2004 to 10% in 2004-2005 sequence analysis of parts of the coronavirus genomes showed considerable similarity to the hcov-nl63 prototype sequence the study demonstrated that hcov-nl63 and hmpv occur in south-west sweden with essentially the same frequency seasonal distribution and clinical characteristics as have been reported in other countries
intestinal immune response plays an important defensive role for pathogens particularly for those transmitted by the oro-faecal route or for foecal shedding modulation this work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with pcv2spiked semen six vaccinated v group and six unvaccinated nv group against pcv2 29 and 53 days post infection dpi an immunohistochemical investigation for iga- iggand igm-antibody bearing plasma cells pcs was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-pcv2 antibody-secreting pcs plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 dpi the iga igg and igm pc density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper villus to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in pc density was identified from duodenum to ileum in the nv group no increase in anti-pcv2 pc density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment the amounts of lamina propria pcv2-specific antibody-producing pcs remained constant 10.55 ± 4.24 and 10.06 ± 5.01 at 29 dpi and 53 dpi respectively in the v group a significant increase in pcv2-specific antibody-producing pcs was observed over time the amounts of pcv2-specific antibodyproducing pcs increased from 9.37 ± 13.36 at 29 dpi to 18.76 ± 15.83 at 53 dpi the data on iga igm and igg pc counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs the sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibodysecreting pcs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues a practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a "booster-like" response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals after virus challenge vaccination induced an increase in the number of pcs containing specific anti-pcv2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa
over the last decade poxviral vectors emerged as a mainstay approach for the induction of t cell-mediated immunity by vaccination and their suitability for human use has led to widespread clinical testing of candidate vectors against infectious intracellular pathogens and cancer in contrast poxviruses have been widely perceived in the vaccine field as a poor choice of vector for the induction of humoral immunity however a growing body of data from both animal models and recent clinical trials now suggests that these vectors can be successfully utilized to prime and boost b cells and effective antibody responses significant progress has been made in the context of heterologous prime-boost immunization regimes whereby poxviruses are able to boost responses primed by other vectors leading to the induction of high-titre antigen-specific antibody responses in other cases poxviral vectors have been shown to stimulate humoral immunity against both themselves and encoded transgenes in particular viral surface proteins such as influenza haemagglutinin in the veterinary field recombinant poxviral vectors have made a significant impact with numerous vectors licensed for use against a variety of animal viruses on-going studies continue to explore the potential of poxviral vectors to modulate qualitative aspects of the humoral response as well as their amenability to adjuvantation seeking to improve quantitative antibody immunogenicity nevertheless the underlying mechanisms of b cell induction by recombinant poxviruses remain poorly defined and further work is necessary to help guide the rational optimization of future poxviral vaccine candidates aiming to induce antibodies
background rodents represent around 43% of all mammalian species are widely distributed and are the natural reservoirs of a diverse group of zoonotic viruses including hantaviruses lassa viruses and tick-borne encephalitis viruses thus analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases results we used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders rodentia lagomorpha and soricomorpha in china we sampled 3055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history conclusions these results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in china and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in asia these findings combined with our previous bat virome data greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot
adenoviruses are common pathogens that are responsible for a wide variety of infectious syndromes the objectives of this study were to identify and characterize members of different adenovirus species at the molecular level and to describe the correlation between viruses and clinical syndromes during a period of 4 years between 2002 and 2006 45 of 512 respiratory specimens 8% from patients with acute respiratory tract infection tested positive for adenovirus four adenovirus isolates from samples sent for enterovirus isolation were also analyzed this research identified 49 confirmed cases of human adenovirus infection by pcr and/or viral culture the most common diagnosis was upper respiratory infection 44%. human adenovirus d was the major species found 59% followed by human adenovirus c 36% and human adenovirus b 4%. human adenovirus 5 was the major serotype found producing bronchiolitis followed by human adenovirus 6 in patients with upper respiratory infection the major serotype found was human adenovirus 17 viruses of the species human adenovirus d were identified in seven 77% cases of acute febrile syndrome four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis acute flaccid paralysis and meningoencephalitis were identified as belonging to the species human adenovirus d our data demonstrate a surprising result about the identification of an unusual association of viruses of the species human adenovirus d with different clinical syndromes this observation could be evaluated as a possible indicator of the emergence of a novel strain but further studies are required
background and aim rhipicephalus microplus rm is one of the most problematic livestock tick species in the world its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and benin particularly the aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife and to confirm the possible role of reservoir wildlife may play in the propagation of the parasite this will help to design more efficient control strategy materials and methods this study was conducted from february to march 2017 in the national parks of benin pendjari and w park and wildfowl's assembly and selling point in benin ticks were manually picked with forceps from each animal after slaughtering by hunters then stored in 70° ethanol collected ticks were counted and identified in the laboratory using the identification key as described by walker results overall seven species of ticks amblyomma variegatum boophilus decoloratus rm boophilus spp hyalomma spp rhipicephalus sanguineus rhipicephalus spp were identified on nine wild animal species sampled cane rat wildcat hare doe cricetoma buffalo buffon cobe and bushbuck and warthog the average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species 3 to 7 between localities visited and 2 to 5 between tick species however these differences are statistically significant only for localities considering tick species and animal species the parasite load of rm and rhipicephalus spp is higher the buffalo being more infested the analysis of deviance reveals that the abundance of ticks observed depends only on the observed localities p>0.05 however the interactions between animal species and localities on the one hand and between animal and tick species on the other hand although not significant have influenced the abundance of ticks as they reduce the residual deviance after their inclusion in the model conclusion this study reported the presence of rm in wildlife of benin and confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites it is therefore an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the west african sub-region and particularly in benin
the non-structural protein 1 ns1 of dengue virus is a useful target for diagnostics of dengue infection since the protein is abundantly circulating in blood during the acute phase of the disease prior work has established that secreted ns1 levels in plasma correlates with viremia levels and hence can also be used to diagnose patients at the risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever thus detection of non-structural dengue antigens may be of benefit for an early rapid diagnosis of dengue infection due to its long half life in the blood here we describe a simple and efficient method for the expression of ns1 in escherichia coli which could potentially be used to develop monoclonal and bispecific antibodies for point of care diagnostics e coli codon optimized synthetic full-length ns1 gene of dengue serotype 1 den-1 was successfully cloned and expressed in very high-level as inclusion bodies the ns1 protein was successfully affinity purified and refolded as a recombinant ns1 rns1 protein in e coli and yield was 230-250 mg/l of bacterial culture the rns1 protein was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development the polyclonal antiserum from animals immunized with this rns1 protein was found to specifically recognize the rns1 thus demonstrating the immunogenic nature of the protein the rns1 protein purified from e coli could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic assay to monitor dengue outbreaks

pulmonary tuberculosis tb remains a serious health problem worldwide effective vaccination strategies are needed we report the development of a novel tb vaccine using vesicular stomatitis virus vsv as a viral vector system to express ag85a vsvag85a was shown to be immunogenic when given to mice by either an intranasal or an intramuscular im route although distinct t-cell profiles resulted from both routes of immunization only intranasal delivery generated a mucosal t-cell response that was protective upon pulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis m tb challenge while this protection manifested at an early time-point after immunization it was not sustained the potential of vsvag85a to be used as a mucosal booster for parenteral priming by an adenoviral tb vaccine expressing ag85a adag85a was investigated vsvag85a immunization markedly boosted antigen-specific t-cell responses in the airway lumen while also augmenting immune activation in the systemic compartment after adag85a priming this translated into significantly better protective efficacy against pulmonary challenge with m tb than either vaccine used alone our study therefore suggests that vsv as a vector system is a promising candidate to be used in a heterologous viral prime-boost immunization regimen against intracellular bacterial infection
for more than two decades the cheetah acinonyx jubatus has been considered a paradigm of disease vulnerability associated with low genetic diversity particularly at the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex mhc cheetahs have been used as a classic example in numerous conservation genetics textbooks as well as in many related scientific publications however earlier studies used methods with low resolution to quantify mhc diversity and/or small sample sizes furthermore high disease susceptibility was reported only for captive cheetahs whereas free-ranging cheetahs show no signs of infectious diseases and a good general health status we examined whether the diversity at mhc class i and class ii-drb loci in 149 namibian cheetahs was higher than previously reported using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis cloning and sequencing mhc genes were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels we detected ten mhc class i and four class ii-drb alleles of which nine mhc class i and all class ii-drb alleles were expressed phylogenetic analyses and individual genotypes suggested that the alleles belong to four mhc class i and three class ii-drb putative loci evidence of positive selection was detected in both mhc loci our study indicated that the low number of mhc class i alleles previously observed in cheetahs was due to a smaller sample size examined on the other hand the low number of mhc class ii-drb alleles previously observed in cheetahs was further confirmed compared with other mammalian species including felids cheetahs showed low levels of mhc diversity but this does not seem to influence the immunocompetence of free-ranging cheetahs in namibia and contradicts the previous conclusion that the cheetah is a paradigm species of disease vulnerability
background genome-wide rnai screening has been widely used to identify host proteins involved in replication and infection of different viruses and numerous host factors are implicated in the replication cycles of these viruses demonstrating the power of this approach however discrepancies on target identification of the same viruses by different groups suggest that high throughput rnai screening strategies need to be carefully designed developed and optimized prior to the large scale screening methods two genome-wide rnai screens were performed in parallel against the entry of pseudotyped marburg viruses and avian influenza virus h5n1 utilizing an hiv-1 based surrogate system to identify host factors which are important for virus entry a comparative analysis approach was employed in data analysis which alleviated systematic positional effects and reduced the false positive number of virus-specific hits results the parallel nature of the strategy allows us to easily identify the host factors for a specific virus with a greatly reduced number of false positives in the initial screen which is one of the major problems with high throughput screening the power of this strategy is illustrated by a genome-wide rnai screen for identifying the host factors important for marburg virus and/or avian influenza virus h5n1 as described in this study conclusions this strategy is particularly useful for highly pathogenic viruses since pseudotyping allows us to perform high throughput screens in the biosafety level 2 bsl-2 containment instead of the bsl-3 or bsl-4 for the infectious viruses with alleviated safety concerns the screening strategy together with the unique comparative analysis approach makes the data more suitable for hit selection and enables us to identify virus-specific hits with a much lower false positive rate emerging and re-emerging human viral pathogens pose one of the major public health concerns since effective countermeasures are not available to detect prevent and treat these viral diseases . the 2013-2015 west africa ebola epidemic with more than 25000 people infected and more than 12000 deaths underlines the global challenge dealing with the infection and diseases associated with these viruses to develop prophylactic and therapeutic options it is important to understand how these viruses interact with their hosts therefore efforts have been made to identify and characterize host factors which are involved in viral replication and infection for different viruses a recently developed technology referred to as genome-wide rna interference rnai based screening has been employed by different groups to identify host factors systematically and a large number of host factors have been implicated as critical for infection for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 and influenza h1n1 virus providing mechanistic insights on the virus/host interactions however the hit overlaps between screens by different groups are pretty low with 3-6 % for hiv-1 screens and 1-12 % for influenza virus screens raising concerns about the potential high false positive rates and even some
in this report 120 healthy one-day-old aa broilers were divided into six groups groups 1-4 received 100 200 400 and 800 mg/l of sodium new houttuyfonate snh with ib vaccine h120 respectively group 5 received pbs and h120 and group 6 il-2 and h120 the chickens were inoculated at 7 and 14 days of age on 0 7 14 21 28 and 35 post first vaccination the dynamic changes of peripheral lymphocyte proliferation cytokine assays and serum antibody titers were assayed respectively by mtt method elisa and hemagglutination inhibition assay hi the results showed that sodium new houttuyfonate significantly raised ib antibody titer in the chickens and also markedly promoted lymphocyte proliferation the serum levels of ifn-c and il-4 in groups 1-4 were higher than those in groups 5 and 6 hence the immunologic enhancement of snh was slightly superior to that of il-2 adjuvant following challenge with ibv chickens inoculated with snh showed fewer and less severe clinical signs lower death rate and less kidney pathology as compared to those of the control groups it indicated that snh could enhance immune responses and increase protection against virulent ibv challenge in chickens
influenza d virus idv has first been identified in 2011 in the usa and was shown to mainly circulate in cattle while idv is associated with mild respiratory signs its prevalence is still unknown in the present study we show that idv has been circulating throughout france in cattle and small ruminants with 47.2% and 1.5% seropositivity respectively the high prevalence and moderate pathogenicity of idv in cattle suggest that it may play an initiating role in the bovine respiratory disease complex
development of an effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars remains to be a priority to prevent possible re-emergence of sars coronavirus sars-cov we previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov s protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies this suggests that the rbd may serve as an ideal vaccine candidate recombinant adeno-associated virus raav has been proven to be an effective system for gene delivery and vaccine development in this study a novel vaccine against sars-cov was developed based on the raav delivery system the gene encoding rbd was cloned into a paav-ires-hrgfp plasmid the immunogenicity induced by the resulting recombinant rbd-raav was evaluated in balb/c mice the results demonstrated that 1 a single dose of rbd-raav vaccination could induce sufficient neutralizing antibody against sars-cov infection 2 two more repeated doses of the vaccination boosted the neutralizing antibody to about 5 times of the level achieved by a single dose of the immunization and 3 the level of the antibody continued to increase for the entire duration of the experiment of 5.5 months these results suggested that rbd-raav is a promising sars candidate vaccine
advanced sequencing techniques have shown that bacteria are not the only complex and important microbes in the human intestine non-bacterial organisms particularly the virome and the mycobiome are important regulators of intestinal immunity and inflammation the virome is mucosal and systemic it can alter the host response to bacteria and interact with host genes and bacteria to contribute to disease pathogenesis the human mycobiome is also complex and can contribute to intestinal inflammation we review what has recently been learned about the nonbacterial and non-archaeal microbes in the gastrointestinal tract discussing their potential effects on health and disease and analytical approaches for their study studies of associations between the microbiome and intestinal pathology should incorporate kingdom-agnostic approaches if we are to fully understand intestinal health and disease
there are 219 virus species that are known to be able to infect humans the first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901 and three to four new species are still being found every year extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered human virus species although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity more than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts mainly mammals and sometimes birds many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins indeed a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks a few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors it seems almost inevitable that new human viruses will continue to emerge mainly from other mammals and birds for the foreseeable future for this reason an effective global surveillance system for novel viruses is needed
mannan-containing products are capable of modulating immune responses in animals however different products may have diverse immunomodulation the experiment was conducted to examine effects of mannan oligosaccharide actigen act on growth performance and serum concentrations of antibodies and infl ammatory mediators in weanling pigs sus scrofa experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv a total of 32 prrsv-negative pigs 3 wk old were randomly assigned from within blocks to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design pigs were blocked by initial bw within sex ancestry was equalized across treatments pigs 8/treatment were kept individually in each pen after 2 wk of an 8-wk period of feeding the treatments pigs received an intranasal inoculation of prrsv or sham medium at 5 wk of age infection by prrsv decreased adg adfi and gf throughout the experiment p < 0.01 actigen did not affect adg p = 0.450 but decreased p = 0.047 adfi from 28 to 42 days postinoculation dpi during that time act improved gf in infected pigs but not in sham controls
in the last two decades several high impact zoonotic disease outbreaks have been linked to bat-borne viruses these include sars coronavirus hendra virus and nipah virus in addition it has been suspected that ebolaviruses and mers coronavirus are also linked to bats it is being increasingly accepted that bats are potential reservoirs of a large number of known and unknown viruses many of which could spillover into animal and human populations however our knowledge into basic bat biology and immunology is very limited and we have little understanding of major factors contributing to the risk of bat virus spillover events here we provide a brief review of the latest findings in bat viruses and their potential risk of crossspecies transmission
the main objective of this brief communication is to inform about the exposure to certain pathogens of interest for mesocarnivores in wildcats felis silvestris silvestris that inhabit a human-domestic-wild ecotone located in a natural park serranía de cuenca central spain blood and mucosal swabs nasal conjunctival and rectal samples were collected from nine alive animals to detect canine distemper virus cdv parvovirus cpv/fpv feline leukaemia virus felv feline coronavirus fcov feline immunodeficiency virus fiv leptospira interrogans chlamydia felis ehrlichia canis toxoplasma gondii and neospora caninum elisa immunochromatograpy microscopy agglutination test and pcr assays were used the results show the first worldwide detection of exposure of wildcats to l interrogans 3 positive/9 analysed and the first detection of exposure to cvd 7/9 of carriers of c felis 2/9 and of fecal spreading of cpv-fpv 2/9 in wildcats in spain exposure to t gondii and cpv-fpv was detected in 5 of the 9 wildcats analysed and to felv in 4 of 9 no fiv fcov ehrlichia canis and neospora caninum were detected the results reveal the circulation of pathogens among the wildcat population studied but more vigilance is needed for an accurate assessment of the impact of these pathogens on the health status of this population
cereal commodities are frequently contaminated with mycotoxins produced by the secondary metabolism of fungal infection among these contaminants deoxynivalenol don also known as vomitoxin is the most prevalent type b trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of don and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed recently don naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv specific antibody responses following experimental infection the objective of this study was to determine the impact of don naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with prrsv live attenuated vaccine eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on don content of the diets 0 2.5 and 3.5 mg don/kg they were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation all pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of ingelvac ® prrsv modified live vaccine mlv blood samples were collected at day −1 6 13 20 27 and 35 post vaccination pv and tested for prrsv rna by rt-qpcr and for virus specific antibodies by elisa results showed that ingestion of don-contaminated diets significantly decreased prrsv viremia all pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 17% and 3 50% out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5 mg of don/kg respectively subsequently all pigs fed control diet developed prrsv specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed prrsv specific antibodies these results suggest that feeding pigs with don-contaminated diet could inhibit vaccination efficiency of prrsv mlv by severely impairing viral replication
worldwide neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important health issues affecting dairy calves and rotavirus a rva is one of its primary causes among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important however the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific g and p genotypes in rva field strains this study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of rva and attempted to monitor the g and p genotypes present in the rva strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with rva g6p strain fecal samples n = 1220 from 122 holstein heifer calves between 0-30 days old that were born from rva-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea the presence of rva in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr g and p amplicons from 10 rva-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing the proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for rva were 62.3% 76/122 and 8.1% 99/1220 respectively using sequence analysis all 10 rva field strains presented genotype g10p . the protection of g6p vaccination is clear as this genotype was not detected in this study and it is known that vaccination against rva reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved this result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of rva genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic rva strains a a alfieri veterinary microbiology 230 2019 260-264 0378-1135/
the recent discoveries of novel human coronaviruses including the coronavirus causing sars and the previously unrecognized human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 indicate that the family coronaviridae harbors more members than was previously assumed all human coronaviruses characterized at present are associated with respiratory illnesses ranging from mild common colds to more severe lower respiratory tract infections since the etiology of a relatively large percentage of respiratory tract diseases remains unidentified it is possible that for a certain number of these illnesses a yet unknown viral causative agent may be found screening for the presence of novel coronaviruses requires the use of a method that can detect all coronaviruses known at present in this chapter we describe a pancoronavirus degenerate primer-based method that allows the detection of all known and possibly unknown coronaviruses by rt-pcr amplification and sequencing of a 251-bp fragment of the coronavirus polymerase gene
background adenoviruses are common pathogens in vertebrates including humans in marine mammals adenovirus has been associated with fatal hepatitis in sea lions however only in rare cases have adenoviruses been detected in cetaceans where no clear correlation was found between presence of the virus and disease status case presentation a novel adenovirus was identified in four captive bottlenose dolphins with self-limiting gastroenteritis viral detection and identification were achieved by pcr-amplification from fecal samples sequencing of partial adenovirus polymerase pol and hexon genes producing the virus in hela cells with pcr and immunofluorescence detection and with sequencing of the amplified pol and hexon gene fragments a causative role of this adenovirus for gastroenteritis was suggested by 1 we failed to identify other potential etiological agents 2 the exclusive detection of this novel adenovirus and of seropositivity for canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 in the four sick dolphins but not in 10 healthy individuals of the same captive population and 3 the virus disappeared from feces after clinical signs receded the partial sequences of the amplified fragments of the pol and hexon genes were closest to those of adenoviruses identified in sea lions with fatal adenoviral hepatitis and to a genbank-deposited sequence obtained from a harbour porpoise conclusion these data suggest that adenovirus can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in dolphins this adenoviral infection can be detected by serology and by pcr detection in fecal material lack of signs of hepatitis in sick dolphins may reflect restricted tissue tropism or virulence of this adenovirus compared to those of the adenovirus identified in sea lions gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supports a common origin of adenoviruses that affect sea mammals our findings suggest the need for vigilance against adenoviruses in captive and wild dolphin populations
although winter dysentery wd which is caused by the bovine coronavirus bcov is characterized by the sudden onset of diarrhea in many adult cattle in a herd the pathogenesis of the wd-bcov is not completely understood in this study colostrumdeprived calves were experimentally infected with a korean wd-bcov strain and examined for viremia enteric and nasal virus shedding as well as for viral antigen expression and virus-associated lesions in the small and large intestines and the upper and lower respiratory tract from 1 to 8 days after an oral infection the wd-bcov-inoculated calves showed gradual villous atrophy in the small intestine and a gradual increase in the crypt depth of the large intestine the wd-bcov-infected animals showed epithelial damage in nasal turbinates trachea and lungs and interstitial pneumonia the wd-bcov antigen was detected in the epithelium of the small and large intestines nasal turbinates trachea and lungs wd-bcov rna was detected in the serum from post-inoculation day 3 these results show that the wd-bcov has dual tropism and induces pathological changes in both the digestive and respiratory tracts of calves to our knowledge this is the first detailed report of dual enteric and respiratory tropisms of wd-bcov in calves comprehensive studies of the dual tissue pathogenesis of the bcov might contribute to an increased understanding of similar pneumoenteric cov infections in humans
we show that a model antigen ovalbumin ova can be chemically conjugated to the exterior of a small heat shock protein shsp cage that has structural similarities to virus-like particles vlps ova-shsp conjugation efficiency was dependent upon the stoichiometry and the length of the small molecule linker utilized and the attachment position on the shsp cage when conjugated ova-shsp was delivered intranasally to naïve mice the resulting immune response to ova was accelerated and intensified and ova-specific igg1 responses were apparent within 5 days after a single immunizing dose illustrating its utility for vaccine development if animals were pretreated with a disparate vlp p22 a non-replicative bacteriophage capsid before ova-shsp conjugate immunization ova-specific igg1 responses were apparent already by 4 days after a single immunizing dose of conjugate in ova-naïve mice additionally the mice pretreated with p22 produced high titer mucosal iga and isotype-switched ova-specific serum igg similarly shsp pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of lung germinal center b cells t follicular helper cells and increased polymeric ig receptor expression priming the lungs for subsequent igg and iga responses to influenza virus challenge thus shsp nanoparticles elicited quick and intense antibody responses and these accelerated responses could similarly be induced to antigen chemically conjugated to the shsp pretreatment of mice with p22 further accelerated the onset of the antibody response to ova-shsp demonstrating the utility of conjugating antigens to vlps for pre- or possibly post-exposure prophylaxis of lung all without the need for adjuvant
we previously developed a respiratory tract vaccine against ebola virus ebov based on human parainfluenza virus type 3 hpiv3 a respiratory paramyxovirus expressing the ebov gp envelope protein hpiv3/gp from an added gene two doses of this vaccine delivered by the intranasal and intratracheal route protected monkeys against intraperitoneal challenge with ebov however concerns exist that the vaccine may have reduced immunogenicity in the adult human population due to pre-existing immunity against hpiv3 here we developed a new vaccine ndv/ gp based on newcastle disease virus ndv an avian paramyxovirus that is antigenically distinct from human viral pathogens and is highly attenuated in monkeys following one intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with ndv/gp titers of ebovspecific antibodies in respiratory tract secretions and serum samples determined by elisa as well as serum ebov-neutralizing antibodies were undetectable or low compared to those induced by hpiv3/gp a second immunization resulted in a substantial boost in serum igg elisa titers yet the titers remained lower than those induced by a second dose of hpiv3/gp in contrast the elisa iga titers in respiratory tract secretions and more importantly the serum ebovneutralizing antibody titers were equal to those induced after the second dose of hpiv3/gp these data suggest that ndv/gp can be effective for immunization against ebov alone or in combination with either hpiv3/gp or another vaccine platform in a heterologous prime-boost regimen
the human coronaviruses hcovs hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 are two recently discovered coronaviruses that circulate widely and are associated with acute respiratory infections ari we detected hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 in specimens collected from may 2008 to march 2010 from patients with ari aged <7.75 years of age attending the beijing children's hospital thirty-two 8.4% and 57 14.9% of 382 specimens tested positive for hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 respectively by real-time rt-pcr use of a luminex xtag rvp fast kit showed that coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza 3 virus was common among patients infected with either virus type in hcov-hku1-infected patients the predominant clinical symptoms were cough fever and expectoration in hcov-nl63-infected patients they were cough fever and rhinorrhea phylogenetic studies showed that the hcov-hku1 nucleoprotein gene was relatively conserved compared to ncbi reference sequences while the 1ab gene of hcov-nl63 showed more variation
canine infectious respiratory disease complex cirdc is associated with multiple factors the possible transmission source can be via community-acquired infection cai or hospital-associated infection hai but the variable factors within these two routes are not well described this study aimed to i investigate a crosssectional incidence of canine respiratory viruses including influenza civ parainfluenza distemper cdv respiratory coronavirus crcov adenovirus-2 and herpesvirus in respiratory-diseased dogs and ii analyze the possibly related risk factors in total 209 dogs with respiratory illness consisting of 133 cai and 76 hai dogs were studied both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were sampled from each dog and subjected for cirdc virus detection using multiplex pcrs common six viruses associated with cirdc were detected in both groups with civ and crcov being predominantly found only cdv was significantly more prevalent in cai than hai dogs multiple virus detections were found in 81.2% and 78.9% of cai and hai dogs respectively co-detection of civ and crcov was represented the highest proportion and most often found with other cird viruses moreover the clinical severity level was notably related to the age of infected dogs but not to the vaccination status sex and transmission route since healthy or control dogs were not included in this study the prevalence of the cird virus infections could not be assessed
virus surveillance of wildlife populations is important for identifying monitoring and predicting the emergence of pathogens that pose a potential threat to animal and human health bats are identified as important wildlife hosts of many viruses capable of causing fatal human disease including members of the henipaviruses coronaviruses rhabdoviruses and filoviruses as global warming and habitat change are thought to impact upon pathogen transmission dynamics and increase the risk of spillover virus surveillance in bat populations remains a significant component of efforts to improve the prediction and control of potential future disease outbreaks caused by bat-borne viruses in this study we have developed two fluid bead array assays containing customized panels that target multiple bat-borne viruses these assays detect up to 11 viral rna's simultaneously in urine samples collected from wild bat populations in australia and bangladesh the assays developed show high specificity for the target viruses and the analytical sensitivity compares favorably to qrt-pcr these assays enhance the ability to monitor multi-pathogen dynamics and identify patterns of virus shedding from bat populations thus informing key approaches to outbreak response and control
an isolated epizootic of a highly fatal feline calicivirus fcv infection manifested in its severest form by a systemic hemorrhagic-like fever occurred over a 1-month period among six cats owned by two different employees and a client of a private veterinary practice the infection may have started with an unowned shelter kitten that was hospitalized during this same period for a severe atypical upper respiratory infection the causative agent was isolated from blood and nasal swabs from two cats the electron microscopic appearance was typical for fcv and capsid gene sequencing showed it to be genetically similar to other less pathogenic ®eld strains an identical disease syndrome was recreated in laboratory cats through oral inoculation with tissue culture grown virus during the course of transmission studies in experimental cats the agent was inadvertently spread by caretakers to an adjoining room containing a group of four normal adult cats one of the four older cats was found dead and a second was moribund within 48±72 h in spite of symptomatic treatment lesions in these animals were similar to those of the ®eld cats but with the added feature of severe pancreatitis the mortality in ®eld cats deliberately infected laboratory cats and inadvertently infected laboratory cats ranged from 33±50%. this new isolate of calicivirus named fcv-ari was neutralized at negligible to low titer by antiserum against the universal fcv-f9 vaccine strain cats orally immunized with fcv-f9 and then challenge-exposed veterinary microbiology 73 2000 281±300 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 0 0 0 0 1 8 3 -8 shortly thereafter with fcv-ari developed a milder self-limiting form of disease indicating partial protection however all of the ®eld cats including the three that died had been previously immunized with parenteral fcv-f9 vaccine fcv-ari caused a disease that was reminiscent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease a highly fatal calicivirus infection of older rabbits #
human coronaviruses hcovs including sars-cov and mers-cov are zoonotic pathogens that originated in wild animals hcovs have large genomes that encode a fixed array of structural and nonstructural components as well as a variety of accessory proteins that differ in number and sequence even among closely related covs thus in addition to recombination and mutation hcov genomes evolve through gene gains and losses in this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular evolution of hcov genomes with special attention to recombination and adaptive events that generated new viral species and contributed to host shifts and to hcov emergence video abstractthe recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov and of middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae as dangerous zoonoses stirred great interest in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses before the sars-cov epidemic only two hcovs were known hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 two additional hcovs hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were discovered in 2004-2005 from clinical specimens . these viruses originated in animals and are mainly responsible for respiratory diseases in humans figure 1a key figure . specifically all hcovs are thought to have a bat origin with the exception of lineage a beta-covs which may have reservoirs in rodents . the phylogenetic relationships of hcovs and other animal covs mentioned in this review are summarized in figure 1a .
a pantropic canine coronavirus ccov strain cb/05 has been recently associated to a fatal outbreak of systemic disease in young dogs we report the clinical virological and serological findings in dogs experimentally infected with strain cb/05 the dogs three 2.5-month-old and two 6-month-old pups were successfully infected shedding viral rna with their faeces for the entire observation period 21 days and displaying systemic clinical signs resembling those observed during the course of natural infection leucopenia acute lymphopenia occurred in all infected dogs with values dropping below 60% of the initial counts considering the severity of the cb/05-induced disease two of the youngest pups were euthanized for ethical reasons at days 8-9 postinfection whereas the other pups underwent a slow but progressive improvement of their clinical status with complete recovery at postmortem examination remarkable lesions were observed in the internal organs of the euthanized pups that tested positive for ccov by real-time rt-pcr and virus isolation on cell cultures all pups seroconverted for ccov as shown by the high optical density values and antibody titres detected by elisa and virusneutralisation tests respectively the present study confirms that strain cb/05 is highly pathogenic for dogs being able to induce a severe disease and in some cases the death even in experimental conditions #
the presence of canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 2a and 2b has been described in brazil however the type 2c had not been reported until now in the current study seven out of nine samples from dogs with diarrhea were characterized as cpv-2c indicating that this virus is already circulating in the brazilian canine population key words canine parvovirus type 2c sequence analysis brazil the canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 emerged as a novel pathogen in the late 70`s 1 and rapidly spread worldwide within few years the virus underwent a rapid evolution and new antigenic types termed cpv-2a and 17 completely replaced the original type 2 21
bats are source of coronaviruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus numerous studies have been carried out to identify new bat viruses related to sars-coronavirus bat-sars-like covs using a reverse-transcribed-polymerase chain reaction assay however a qualitative pcr could underestimate the prevalence of infection affecting the epidemiological evaluation of bats in viral ecology in this work an sybr green-real time pcr assay was developed for diagnosing infection with sars-related coronaviruses from bat guano and was applied as screening tool in a survey carried out on 45 greater horseshoe bats rhinolophus ferrumequinum sampled in italy in 2009 the assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility its application on bats screening resulted in a prevalence of 42%. this method could be suitable as screening tool in epidemiological surveys about the presence of bat-sars-like covs consequently to obtain a more realistic scenario of the viral prevalence in the population
dna vaccination using vectors expressing the gag/pol and env genes of feline leukaemia virus felv and plasmids encoding feline interleukin-12 il-12 and il-18 completely protected cats from viraemia following challenge . however the relative contribution of each cytokine gene towards protection is unknown this study aimed to resolve this issue il-12 and il-18 constructs were modified to ensure effective expression and bioactivity was demonstrated using specific assays kittens were immunised intramuscularly with felv dna and various cytokine constructs together with control kittens these were challenged oronasally with felv and monitored for 15 weeks all six kittens given felv il-12 and il-18 were protected from the establishment of persistent viraemia and four from latent infection of six kittens immunised with felv dna and il-18 all were protected from viraemia and five from latent infection in contrast three of five kittens given felv dna and il-12 became persistently viraemic therefore the adjuvant effect on the felv dna vaccine appears to reside in the expression of il-18
balb/c male mice were mated with either swiss-webster or mf1 females to produce first generation cross-bred offspring hybridoma cell lines from the fusion of p3-ns1-ag4/1 myeloma cells with spleen cells sensitised to the porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis were injected intraperitoneally into these mice to produce ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies mice of 11 weeks of age weighing between 26 and 34 g were used the volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross-bred offspring than in the balb/c parent the fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the mf1 cross-breed and balb/c parent but a lesser volume in the swiss-webster cross-breed the antibody titres of the ascites as determined by virus neutralisation radioimmune and indirect immune fluorescence assays did not differ significantly between mouse types the ability to use all offspring from a litter of cross-bred mice irrespective of sex and the increased volume of ascitic fluid formed in each mouse permits fewer animals to be used for the production of ascites in these strains thereby offering considerable economic and ethical advantages over the use of balb/c mice
the overhunting of wildlife for food and commercial gain presents a major threat to biodiversity in tropical forests and poses health risks to humans from contact with wild animals using a recent survey of wildlife offered at wild meat markets in malaysia as a basis we review the literature to determine the potential zoonotic infection risks from hunting butchering and consuming the species offered we also determine which taxa potentially host the highest number of pathogens and discuss the significant disease risks from traded wildlife considering how cultural practices influence zoonotic transmission we identify 51 zoonotic pathogens 16 viruses 19 bacteria and 16 parasites potentially hosted by wildlife and describe the human health risks thesuidae and the cervidae families potentially host the highest number of pathogens we conclude that there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of zoonotic pathogens and recommend performing microbial food safety risk assessments to assess the hazards of wild meat consumption overall there may be considerable zoonotic risks to people involved in the hunting butchering or consumption of wild meat in southeast asia and these should be considered in public health strategies
retrospective comparisons of the prevalence and age where appropriate of some childhood infectious illnesses and vaccinations together with serological evidence for exposure to 16 viruses many of which have previously been implicated in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis ms were made in 177 patients with acute optic neuritis other recent isolated demyelinating episodes or established ms and 164 controls the expected high frequency of hla-dr2 in patients with demyelinating disease was matched by preselection of normal controls with this antigen dr2 + the remaining individuals were classified as hla-dr2 negative/dr3 positive dr3+ or hla-dr2 and 3 negative dr2/3 -. cases were compared with controls collectively and in analyses restricted to each genetic group these comparisons were repeated considering the three categories of patients with demyelination and two control populations separately all dr2 + dr3+ and dr2/3 -individuals were compared in a single analysis to assess the effect of hla type itself on the results patients with demyelinating disease had rubella and measles at a later age and reported mumps infection more frequently than controls age of typhoid vaccination and duration of exposure to domestic dogs was higher in all cases than controls age of measles and mumps but not rubella was higher in dr2+ cases than controls but differences were not observed in the other genetic groups higher rubella antibody titres were present in all cases than controls and in analyses confined to dr2+ individuals in whom higher epstein barr virus antibody titres were also present measles haemagglutination inhibition and parainfluenza i antibody titres were increased and influenza a antibodies detected less frequently in all patients with optic neuritis and those with dr2 compared with appropriate controls influenza b antibody titres were lower in all dr2 4-cases than controls higher adenovirus and varicella zoster antibody titres were present in dr2/3-patients with demyelination and other neurological diseases compared with normal controls overall older age of infection and higher antibody titres were observed more often in patients with optic neuritis in particular dr2 + cases than other individuals with demyelination or controls our serological results are consistent with the presence of abnormal hla-immunological reactivity in patients with ms but cannot be explained only by an effect of dr type itself age at which susceptible individuals develop some common childhood infections may also influence the subsequent development of the disease
the worldwide outbreak of the swine-origin 2009 h1n1 influenza a virus iav and an increasing number of influenza cases caused by a highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 have accelerated the need to develop vaccines and antiviral agents against iavs among various antivirals neutralizing monoclonal antibodies mabs are considered important passive therapeutics having an immediate effect against viral pathogens here we report a pseudovirus neutralization assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mabs targeting hemagglutinin ha of h5n1 and h1n1 iav in this study we generated six pseudoviruses with an hiv-1 backbone respectively expressing ha of four clades of h5n1 iav and the 2009 epidemic h1n1 iav the resulting pseudoviruses were able to infect a variety of human and non-human cells with 293t cells from human kidney as the most susceptible target cells using the established pseudovirus neutralization assay we showed that three of ten selected mabs specific to ha could potently neutralize infection of a pseudovirus bearing ha from the homologous iav a/vietnam/1194/ 2004h5n1 strain this was highly consistent with the result of a microneutralization assay testing the same strain of a live iav since the pseudovirus neutralization assay does not involve an infectious virus and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory it may be applied for safe and rapid screening of neutralizing mabs and antiviral agents targeting ha of iavs
the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity genomics and cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses especially those from bats the second most speciose order of mammals herein we identified a novel coronavirus provisionally designated rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 ro-batcov gccdc1 in the rectal swab samples of rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus rt-pcr and next-generation sequencing although the virus is similar to rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 ro-batcov hku9 in genome characteristics it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the international committee of taxonomy of viruses ictv more striking was that ro-batcov gccdc1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus subgenomic mrna and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia therefore here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded positive-sense plos pathogens |
the mesoniviruses mesovs belong to the newly described mesoniviridae family order nidovirales they have never been reported in senegal until recently during a study in arbovirus emergence with the detection of a new species of mesov named dianke virus dkv from common mosquitoes from eastern senegal actually their vector competence for this newly described dkv is unknown we therefore estimated the vector competence of culex tritaeniorhynchus culex quinquefasciatus aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected in senegal for dkv using oral infection whole bodies legs/wings and saliva samples were tested for dkv by rt-pcr to estimate infection dissemination and transmission rates the infectivity of virus particles in the saliva was confirmed by infecting c6/36 cells virus transmission rates were up to 95.45% in culex tritaeniorhynchus 28% in cx quinquefasciatus and 9.09% in aedes aegypti viral particles in the saliva were confirmed infectious by c6/36 cell culture an gambiae was able to disseminate dkv only at 20 days post-infection this study shows that culex mosquitoes are more competent than ae aegypti for dkv while anopheles gambiae is not likely a competent vector
bat coronaviruses cov are putative precursors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov and other cov that crossed the species barrier from zoonotic reservoirs into the human population to determine the presence and distribution of cov in iberian bats 576 individuals of 26 different bat species were captured in 13 locations in spain we report for the first time the presence of 14 coronaviruses in 9 iberian bat species
a serological trapping technique is described for detecting transmissible gastroenteritis tge virus in faeces the technique involves the coating of electron microscope grids with protein a and specific tge virus antiserum optimal conditions for performing this solid phase immune electron microscopy technique were a concentration 250 jigmr of protein a
background the prevalence and risk factors for infection with enteropathogens in dogs frequenting dog parks have been poorly documented and infected dogs can pose a potential zoonotic risk for owners hypothesis/objectives to determine the prevalence and risk factors of infection with enteropathogens and zoonotic giardia strains in dogs attending dog parks in northern california and to compare results of fecal flotation procedures performed at a commercial and university parasitology laboratory animals three-hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in northern california methods prospective study fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs scored for consistency and owners completed a questionnaire specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation dfa and pcr for detection of 11 enteropathogens giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination results enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs 38% of which 62 54% did not have diarrhea frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency p = .0039 but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection twenty-seven dogs 9% were infected with giardia and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages c and d the frequency of giardia detection on fecal flotation was significantly lower at the commercial laboratory versus the university laboratory p = .013 and pcr for giardia was negative in 11/27 dogs 41% that were positive on fecal flotation or dfa conclusions and clinical importance enteropathogens were commonly detected in dogs frequenting dog parks and infection with giardia correlated with fecal consistency pcr detection of giardia had limited diagnostic utility and detection of giardia cysts by microscopic technique can vary among laboratories
turkey coronavirus tcov is a gammacoronavirus coronaviridae nidovirales responsible for digestive disorders in young turkeys tcov has been associated with poult enteritis complex a syndrome that severely affects turkey production no medical prophylaxis exists to control tcov therefore sanitary measures such as cleaning and disinfection are essential it is thus important to evaluate temperatures that allow persistence of tcov in the environment two series of aliquots of a suspension of a french isolate of tcov fr tcov were stored at room temperature or '48c for 0 to 40 days as tcov does not grow in cell culture the presence of residual infectious tcov in the stored samples was tested by inoculating embryonated specific pathogen free turkey eggs as tcov does not induce lesions in the embryo virus replication in the jejunum and ileum of the embryos was detected 4 days post inoculation using rna extraction and a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based on the nucleocapsid gene no surviving virus was detected after 10 days storage at '21.691.48c or after 40 days storage at '4.191.68c these temperatures being representative of the mean summer and winter temperatures respectively in the major french poultryproducing region the relatively short survival of the virus at room temperature should contribute to limited virus survival during summer months however infectious virus was still detected after 20 days storage at the cooler temperatures a finding that suggests prolonged survival of fr tcov and easier transmission between poultry farms in a cool environment are possible
mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases including yellow fever and malaria yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes we present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level in a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a west african rainforest area which included primary forest secondary forest plantations and human settlements variation was observed in the abundance of anopheles aedes culex and uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families bunyaviridae coronaviridae flaviviridae and rhabdoviridae as well as an unclassified virus polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat based on these initial analyses we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection
bat populations harbour a multitude of viruses some of these are pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in other animals or humans therefore it is important to monitor the populations and characterize these viruses in this study the presence of coronaviruses covs in different species of danish bats was investigated using active surveillance at different geographical locations in denmark faecal samples were screened for the presence of covs using pan-cov real-time rt-pcr assays the amplicons obtained from five different species of bats were sequenced phylogenetic analysis revealed a species-specific clustering with the samples from myotis daubentonii showing a close resemblance to coronavirus sequences obtained from the same species of bat in germany and the united kingdom our results show for the first time that multiple distinct alphacoronaviruses are present in the danish bat populations
a phage-display library is the most broadly used platform for preparation of recombinant human monoclonal antibody fab fragments panning is effective for the selection of immunoglobulin genes from naïve and immune libraries however it is possible to bypass the phage display system if human peripheral lymphocytes are obtained from seropositive patients with infectious diseases as a source of immunoglobulin genes direct screening of bacterial colonies producing fab fragments by colony blotting using filter membranes is practical for the isolation of human fab fragments to major antigens of pathogens an oligoclonal culture can also be used and is a partial application of epstein-barr virus transformation of peripheral lymphocytes using these procedures neutralizing antibody fab fragments to various antigens can be obtained with a sufficient level of cloning efficacy chain shuffling and site-directed mutagenesis are also useful ways to improve the quality of the cloned antibody fab fragments

sars-cov-2 covid-19 has caused currently ongoing global plague and imposed great challenges to health managing systems all over the world with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths in addition to racing to develop vaccines neutralizing antibodies nabs to this virus have been extensively sought and are expected to provide another prevention and therapy tool against this frantic pandemic to offer fast isolation and shortened early development a large human naïve phage display antibody library was built and used to screen specific nabs to the receptor-binding domain rbd the key for covid-19 virus entry through a human receptor ace2 the obtained rbd-specific antibodies were characterized by epitope mapping facs and neutralization assay some of the antibodies demonstrated spike-neutralizing property and ace2-competitiveness our work proved that rbd-specific neutralizing binders from human naïve antibody phage display library are promising candidates to for further covid-19 therapeutics development
ebola virus ebov a member of the family filoviridae is responsible for causing ebola virus disease evd formerly named ebola hemorrhagic fever this is a severe often fatal illness with mortality rates varying from 50 to 90% in humans although the virus and associated disease has been recognized since 1976 it was only when the recent outbreak of ebov in 2014-2016 highlighted the danger and global impact of this virus necessitating the need for coming up with the effective vaccines and drugs to counter its pandemic threat albeit no commercial vaccine is available so far against ebov a few vaccine candidates are under evaluation and clinical trials to assess their prophylactic efficacy these include recombinant viral vector recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vector and modified vaccinia ankara virus ebola virus-like particles virus-like replicon particles dna and plant-based vaccines due to improvement in the field of genomics and proteomics epitope-targeted vaccines have gained top priority correspondingly several therapies have also been developed including immunoglobulins against specific viral structures small cell-penetrating antibody fragments that target intracellular ebov proteins small interfering rnas and oligomer-mediated inhibition have also been verified for evd treatment other treatment options include viral entry inhibitors transfusion of convalescent blood/serum neutralizing antibodies and gene expression inhibitors repurposed drugs which have proven safety profiles can be adapted after high-throughput screening for efficacy and potency for evd treatment herbal and other natural products are also being explored for evd treatment further studies to better understand the pathogenesis and antigenic structures of the virus can help in developing an effective vaccine and identifying appropriate antiviral targets this review presents the recent advances in designing and developing vaccines drugs and therapies to counter the ebov threat
clinical disease associated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection in naïve pigs is well chronicled however information on endemic pedv infection is limited to characterize chronic pedv infection the duration of infectious virus shedding and development of protective immunity was determined on day 0 d0 a growing pig was challenged with pedv and 13 contacts were commingled on d7 9 contact pigs principal virus group pg were selected moved to a separate room and commingled with one sentinel pig s1 this process was repeated weekly with s2 s3 and s4 the pg was pedv-positive by pcr from d3-11 with some pigs intermittently positive to d42 pigs s1 and s2 were pedv-positive within 24 hours of commingling antibodies were detected in all pg by d21 and by 7 days post-contact in s1 and s2 pigs s3 and s4 were pcr and antibody negative following commingling to evaluate protective immunity 5 naïve pigs n and the pg were challenged n/c pg/c with homologous virus on d49
background recently several new human coronaviruses have been identified objectives to define the seroepidemiology of group i human coronaviruses study design a recombinant protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on portions of the nucleocapsid protein of group i human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults results for hcov-229e the percentages of seropositive individuals were 57.1% for infants <2 months old 38.9% for infants 2-3 months old 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old 42.9-50.0% for infants 6-12 months old 34.8-62.5% for individuals 1-20 years old for hcov-nl63 the percentages of seropositive individuals were 45.2% for infants <2 months old 11.1% for infants 2-3 months old 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old 28.6-40.0% for infants 6-12 months old 25.0-70.3% for individuals 1-20 years old conclusions infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year
background toxocariasis is a worldwide zoonotic parasitic disease caused by species of toxocara and toxascaris common in dogs and cats herein a meta-analysis was contrived to assess the prevalence of toxocara/toxascaris in carnivore and human hosts in different regions of iran from april 1969 to june 2019 methods the available online articles of english pubmed science direct scopus and ovid and persian sid iran medex magiran and iran doc databases and also the articles that presented in held parasitology congresses of iran were involved results the weighted prevalence of toxocara/toxascaris in dogs canis familiaris and cats felis catus was 24.2% 95% ci 18.0-31.0% and 32.6% 95% ci 22.6-43.4% respectively also pooled prevalence in jackal canis aureus and red fox vulpes vulpes was 23.3% 95% ci 7.7-43.2% and 69.4% 95% ci 60.3-77.8% correspondingly weighted mean prevalence of human cases with overall 28 records was 9.3% 95% ci 6.3-13.1%. the weighted prevalence of toxocara canis toxocara cati and toxascaris leonina was represented as 13.8% 95% ci 9.8-18.3% 28.5% 95% ci 20-37.7% and 14.3% 95% ci 8.1-22.0% respectively conclusion our meta-analysis results illustrate a considerable prevalence rate of toxocara/toxascaris particularly in cats and dogs of northern parts of iran the presence of suitable animal hosts optimum climate and close contact of humans and animals would have been the reason for higher seroprevalence rates of human cases in our region given the significance clinical outcomes of human toxocara/toxascaris necessary measures should be taken
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has infected more than 1900 humans since 2012 the syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death the virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the 1980s therefore dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area here we developed four vaccine candidates against mers-cov based on chadox1 and mva viral vectors two candidates per vector all vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of mers-cov chadox1 mers vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene tpa where mva mers vaccines were produced with tpa but either the mh5 or f11 promoter driving expression of the spike gene all vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime-boost regimens chadox1 mers with tpa induced higher neutralising antibodies than chadox1 mers without tpa a single dose of chadox1 mers with tpa elicited cellular immune responses as well as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by mva mers the humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of chadox1 mers with tpa was equivalent to two doses of mva mers also with tpa mva mers with mh5 or f11 promoter induced similar antibody levels however f11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of mva mers to significantly higher magnitudes in conclusion our study showed that mers-cov vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising different viral vectors various genetic designs of the vectors or different regimens to increase immunogenicity chadox1 and mva vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these mers vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials
development of vaccination strategies for emerging pathogens are particularly challenging because of the sudden nature of the emergence of these viruses and the long process needed for traditional vaccine development therefore there is a need for development of a rapid method of vaccine development that can respond to emerging pathogens in a short time frame the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov in late 2012 demonstrate the importance of coronaviruses as emerging pathogens the spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses reside on the surface of the virion and are responsible for virus entry the spike glycoprotein is the major immunodominant antigen of coronaviruses and has proven to be an excellent target for vaccine designs that seek to block coronavirus entry and promote antibody targeting of infected cells vaccination strategies for coronaviruses have involved live attenuated virus recombinant viruses non-replicative virus-like particles expressing coronavirus proteins or dna plasmids expressing coronavirus genes none of these strategies has progressed to an approved human coronavirus vaccine in the ten years since sars-cov emerged here we describe a novel method for generating mers-cov and sars-cov full-length spike nanoparticles which in combination with adjuvants are able to produce high titer antibodies in mice
enterovirus 71 ev71 causes hand-foot-and-mouth diseases as well as neurological complications in young children interferon ifn can inhibit the replication of many viruses with low cytotoxic effects previously an adenovirus vectored mouse interferon-a def201 subtype 5 was generated by wu et al 2007 in this study the antiviral effects of def201 against ev71 were evaluated in a murine model 6 eday-old balb/c mice were administered a single dose of def201 before or after infection with lethal dose of ev71 the survival rate clinical symptoms tissue viral loads and histology pathogenesis were evaluated ifn gene expression following a single dose of def201 maintained high concentrations of 100 e9000 pg/ml for more than 7 days in mice serum pre-infection administration of a single dose of 10 6 pfu of def201 offered full protection of the mice against ev71 infection compared with the empty ad5 vector control in addition virus load in def201-treated mice muscle tissue was significantly decreased as compared with empty vector control histopathology analysis revealed that def201 significantly prevented the development of severe tissue damage with reduction of viral antigen in the murine muscle tissue post-infection treatment at 6 h offered full protection and partial protection at 12 h indicating that def201 could be used as an anti-ev71 therapeutic agent in early stage of ev71 infection in addition our study showed that def201 enhanced the neutralization ability of serum in ev71-vaccinated mice implying that def201 could promote the production of specific anti-ev71 antibodies in conclusion single dose of def201 is highly efficacious as a prophylactic agent against ev71 infection in vivo
human cytomegalovirus hcmv infection is a major cause of morbidity in the recipients of organ transplants and in the congenitally infected infants hcmv vaccine has emerged as an effective approach to prevent hcmv infection particularly for the development of multiple viral antigens vaccination and human leukocyte antigen hla-restricted polyepitope technology as the chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide it is important to develop hcmv vaccines more specific for the chinese population by targeting chinese-restricted hla alleles and antigens in the present study we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication-deficient adenovirus ad5f35 which encodes 83 hcmv t cell epitopes from 15 different hcmv antigens restricted to 14 hla i and 7 hla ii alleles that cover 92% of the chinese population our results show that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine ad5f35-ctláth can be efficiently transfected and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs with little cytopathic activity ad5f35-ctláth can also be endogenously processed and presented by pbmcs ad5f35-ctláth-stimulated hcmv-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls showed strong cytolytic activity against hcmv polyepitope-sensitized target cells the ctl activity was accompanied by high levels of ifn-c production after ad5f35-ctláth stimulation the specificity and vigorous response to the recombinant adenovirus vaccine in vitro makes it a potential candidate to be used for transplantation recipients or congenitally infected infants
callebaut p pensaert m b and hooyberghs j 1989 a competitive inhibition elisa for the differentiation of serum antibodies from pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev or with the tgev-related porcine respiratory coronavirus vet mtcrobml 20 9-19 a competitive inhibition elisa was developed to detect non-neutralizing antibodies to the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev in porcine sera using a monoclonal antibody as an indicator it was demonstrated that field stratus of the tgev-related porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv did not induce this antibody whereas the miller strain and field strains of tgev did the sensitivity of the competitive inhibition elisa appeared to be similar to that of the virus neutralization vn test the test enables differentiation of pigs which were previously infected with tgev or prcv and which cannot be distinguished by the classical antl-tgev neutralization test the present test is useful for selective serodiagnosis
background careful selection and testing of plasma reduces the risk of blood-borne viruses in the starting material for plasma-derived products furthermore effective measures such as pasteurization at 608c for 10 hours have been implemented in the manufacturing process of therapeutic plasma proteins such as human albumin coagulation factors immunoglobulins and enzyme inhibitors to inactivate blood-borne viruses of concern a comprehensive compilation of the virus reduction capacity of pasteurization is presented including the effect of stabilizers used to protect the therapeutic protein from modifications during heat treatment inactivation kinetics of pasteurization for a broad range of viruses were evaluated in the relevant intermediates from more than 15 different plasma manufacturing processes studies were carried out under the routine manufacturing target variables such as temperature and productspecific stabilizer composition additional studies were also performed under robustness conditions that is outside production specifications the data demonstrate that pasteurization inactivates a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics after a maximum of 6 hours' incubation no residual infectivity could be detected for the majority of enveloped viruses effective inactivation of a range of nonenveloped viruses with the exception of nonhuman parvoviruses was documented conclusion pasteurization is a very robust and reliable virus inactivation method with a broad effectiveness against known blood-borne pathogens and emerging or potentially emerging viruses pasteurization has proven itself to be a highly effective step in combination with other complementary safety measures toward assuring the virus safety of final product s tudies on inactivation of viruses in biologics were initially triggered after 23000 cases of hepatitis were reported in us armed forces personnel in 1942 associated with the administration of certain lots of yellow fever vaccine stabilized with non-heattreated human serum 1 subsequently the effectiveness of abbreviations b19v 5 human parvovirus b19 bohv-1 5 bovine herpesvirus 1 bvdv 5 bovine viral diarrhea virus c1-inh 5 c1 inhibitor concentrate cpv 5 canine parvovirus dhbv 5 duck hepatitis b virus ehv-1 5 equine herpesvirus 1 h1n1 h5n1 5 influenza virus a hhv-5 5 human herpesvirus 5 hsv 5 herpes simplex virus lacv 5 la crosse virus lod 5 detection limit mvm 5 minute virus of mice prv 5 pseudorabies virus strain phylaxia/bartha rfs 5 reduction factors sars-cov 5 sars coronavirus sfv 5 semliki forest virus sinv 5 sindbis virus tbev 5 tick-borne encephalitis tgev 5 transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus wnv 5 west nile virus yfv 5 yellow fever virus zikv 5 zika virus from
bats are natural reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses which have received renewed interest after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov in humans this study describes the identification and molecular characterization of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in bats in italy from 2010 to 2012 sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus rt-pcr coronavirus rnas were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses a phylogenetic analysis of rna-dependent rna polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying two alphacoronaviruses from kuhl's pipistrelle pipistrellus kuhlii three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats rhinolophus hipposideros and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from kuhl's pipistrelle common noctule nyctalus noctula and savi's pipistrelle hypsugo savii this study fills a substantive gap in the knowledge on bat-cov ecology in italy and extends the current knowledge on clade 2c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses
background despite the crucial role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for zoonosis and some of the most threatening diseases for wild carnivores such as distemper and parvovirosis little is known about the epidemiological features and the risk factors involved in pathogen exposure of dogs that live in human/wildlife interfaces and actually contacts wildlife through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six atlantic forest fragments in southeast brazil results widespread exposure to canine parvovirus 97 % canine distemper virus 15 % and canine adenovirus 27 % was detected but none for canine coronavirus dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks exposure was associated with dog sex and age lack of health care and the number of people in the households remarkably factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected conclusions according to identified associations reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog's movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary the study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs and consequently of atlantic forest's wild carnivores
background the microscopic agglutination test mat is commonly used for the diagnosis of canine leptospirosis in dogs it is sometimes suggested that the serogroup with the highest mat titer is the infecting serogroup however this is not true in humans with confirmed leptospirosis we sought to investigate the value of mat results in predicting the infecting serogroup by comparing results across several laboratories and within individual dogs over time objectives to examine the variability in mat results across different laboratories in dogs recently vaccinated against leptospirosis and in dogs with clinical leptospirosis and to investigate variability over time in mat results in individual dogs with leptospirosis animals eighteen dogs from a research colony 9 of which had been vaccinated against leptospirosis and 17 dogs clinically diagnosed with leptospirosis methods serum samples were submitted to up to 5 veterinary diagnostic laboratories for mat titers from each dog on at least 1 occasion mat results also were followed over time in 6 dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis results mat results were discordant across different laboratories in dogs recently vaccinated against leptospirosis and in dogs with clinical leptospirosis mat results varied over time in individual dogs with the disease conclusions and clinical importance the mat is a valuable test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs but it is unlikely that test results can be used to predict the infecting serogroup laboratories offering the mat should consider participation in a proficiency scheme
two severe porcine infectious diseases pseudorabies pr and transmissible gastroenteritis tge caused by pseudorabies virus prv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev respectively often result in serious economic loss in animal husbandry worldwide vaccination is the important prevention means against both infections to achieve a prv genome-based virus live vector aiming at further tgev/prv bivalent vaccine development a recombinant plasmid pug was constructed via inserting partial pk and full-length gg genes of prv strain bartha k-61 amplified into puc119 vector in parallel another recombinant phs was generated by introducing a fragment designated s1 encoding the major antigen sites of s gene from tgev strain th-98 into a prokaryotic expression vector pp ro ex htc the sv40 polya sequence was then inserted into the downstream of s1 fragment of phs the continuous region containing s1fragment sv40 polya and four single restriction enzyme sites digested from phs was subcloned into the downstream of gg promoter of pug in addition a lacz reporter gene was introduced into the universal transfer vector named pugs-lacz subsequently a prv genome-based virus live vector was generated via homologous recombination the functionally effective vector was purified and partially characterized moreover the potential advantages of this system are discussed
background-coronaviruses infect numerous animal species causing a variety of illnesses including respiratory neurologic and enteric disease human coronaviruses hcov are mainly associated with respiratory tract disease but have been implicated in enteric disease study design-clinical samples submitted for infectious diarrhea testing were collected from december 2007 through march 2008 rna extraction and rt-pcr was performed for stools negative for clostridium difficile using primer sets against hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 clinical data from samples positive for coronaviruses were reviewed and recorded
objectives to evaluate prevalence of enteric viruses in healthy dogs and to compare it with prevalences in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea methods faecal samples were collected from 200 healthy dogs and examined by electron microscopy for presence of viral particles data were compared with viral prevalences that had been determined retrospectively by electron microscopy for 936 dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea results there were significantly more negative faecal samples among the healthy dogs 82 0 per cent compared with 55 8 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea p<0 001 with a prevalence of 17 5 per cent significantly more healthy dogs were shedding coronavirus compared with 11 6 per cent in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea p50 034 parvovirus was only detected in one healthy dog 0 5 per cent thus with a prevalence that was significantly lower than 16 0 per cent detected in the dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea p<0 001 paramyxovirus was not found in any of the healthy dogs but was found in 9 3 per cent of dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea p<0 001 clinical significance results suggest that shedding of parvovirus and paramyxovirus is strongly associated with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea however coronavirus seems to be even more prevalent among healthy dogs raising the need for further studies to investigate the strain-associated pathogenicity of this virus
rna viruses with their high potential for mutation and epidemic spread are the most common class of pathogens found as new causes of human illness despite great advances made in diagnostic technology since the 1950s the annual rate at which novel virulent viruses have been found has remained at 2-3 most emerging viruses are zoonoses they have jumped from mammal or bird hosts to humans an analysis of virus discovery indicates that the small number of novel viruses discovered annually is an artifact of inadequate surveillance in tropical and subtropical countries where even established endemic pathogens are often misdiagnosed many of the emerging viruses of the future are already infecting humans but remain to be uncovered by a strategy of disease surveillance in selected populations
evolution has led to the expansion of survival strategies in pathogens including bacteria and emergence of drug resistant strains proved to be a major global threat vaccination is a promising strategy to protect human population reverse vaccinology is a more robust vaccine development approach especially with the availability of large-scale sequencing data and rapidly dropping cost of the techniques for acquiring such data from various organisms the present study implements an immunoinformatic approach for screening the possible antigenic proteins among various pathogenic bacteria to systemically arrive at epitope-based vaccine candidates against 14 pathogenic bacteria thousand four hundred and fifty nine virulence factors and five hundred and forty six products of essential genes were appraised as target proteins to predict potential epitopes with potential to stimulate different arms of the immune system to address the self-tolerance self-epitopes were identified by mapping on 1000 human proteome and were removed our analysis revealed that 21proteins from 5 bacterial species were found as virulent as well as essential to their survival proved to be most suitable vaccine target against these species in addition to the prediction of mhc-ii binders b cell and t cell epitopes as well as adjuvants individually from proteins of all 14 bacterial species a stringent criteria lead us to identify 252 unique epitopes which are predicted to be t-cell epitopes b-cell epitopes mhc ii binders and vaccine adjuvants in order to provide service to scientific community we developed a web server vactarbac for designing of vaccines against above species of bacteria this platform integrates a number of tools that includes visualization tools to present antigenicity/epitopes density on an antigenic sequence these tools will help users to identify most promiscuous vaccine candidates in a pathogenic antigen this server vactarbac is available from url http//webs iiitd edu in/raghava/vactarbac/.
an ideal vaccine against mucosal pathogens such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov should confer sustained protective immunity at both systemic and mucosal levels here we evaluated the in vivo systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune responses induced by a single intramuscular or intragastric administration of recombinant adenoviral type 5 ad5 or type 41 ad41 -based vaccines expressing the mers-cov spike s protein intragastric administration of either ad5-s or ad41-s induced antigen-specific igg and neutralizing antibody in serum however antigen-specific t-cell responses were not detected in contrast after a single intramuscular dose of ad5-s or ad41-s functional antigen-specific t-cell responses were elicited in the spleen and pulmonary lymphocytes of the mice which persisted for several months both radbased vaccines administered intramuscularly induced systemic humoral immune responses neutralizing igg antibodies our results show that a single dose of ad5-s-or ad41-s-based vaccines represents an appealing strategy for the control of mers-cov infection and transmission

transmission of mouse hepatitis virus mhv in utero following oronasal inoculation of pregnant mice was found to depend upon mhv strain and host genotype virulent polytropic mhv-jhm was recovered from multiple maternal tissues including liver and uterus as well as placenta and fetus in susceptible balb/cbyj mice fetuses were infected during all 3 trimesters of pregnancy low virulence polytropic mhv-s infected fetuses in a low percentage of susceptible balb/cbyj dams infection of resistant cd-1 mice with mhv-jhm was limited with no fetal infection enterotropic mhv-y was largely restricted to intestine of balb/cbyj and cd-1 dams with minimal dissemination and no fetal infection maternally-derived mhv igg antibody was detectable in pup sera through 4 weeks of age antibody titers were generally lower in second litters of the same dam cross-fostering experiments showed that antibody was transferred via colostrum and not in utero and that pups were capable of absorption through 2 weeks of age pups nursing immune dams were protected against mhv challenge at 1 and 2 weeks of age compared to pups nursing naive dams immunity to mhv challenge was cross-protective against both antigenically homotypic and heterotypic strains of mhv
calf diarrhea causes severe economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide this study investigated the prevalence of bovine coronavirus bcov bovine norovirus bnov bovine group a rotavirus borva and bovine torovirus btov in calves aged ≤ 60 days regardless of diarrhea across nine different regions in the republic of korea rok and reported associations between these viruses and diarrhea fecal samples were collected rectally from 689 calves normal n = 360 and diarrheic n = 329 bnov 84/689 12.2% was the most prevalent regardless of diarrhea followed by bcov 37/689 5.4% btov 15/689 2.2% and borva 13/689 1.9%. although bcov p = 0.032 and borva p = 0.007 were significantly associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves bnov and btov showed no association infection by the four pathogens had no relationship with calf age borva was detected only in calves aged < 30 days but this finding was not statistically significant phylogenetic analysis revealed that bcov isolates obtained in this study were distinct from the other known bcovs and all bnov isolates belonged to giii.2 genotype genetic variations in bnovs are present in the rok borva isolates distributed in the rok were assigned to g6p within the p genotype our isolates were divided into two lineages p-iii and p-viii p-viii lineage was dominant in pre-weaned korean native calves our btov isolates were more closely related to a european isolate b145 than to japanese isolates here bnov was frequently identified in calves suggesting its non-significant contribution to calf diarrhea whereas bcov and borva were responsible for calf diarrhea in the rok consequently our results highlight the importance of rapid diagnosis against these viruses in calf diarrhea
background nipah virus niv is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent in the family paramyxoviridae that is maintained in nature by bats outbreaks have occurred in malaysia singapore india and bangladesh and have been associated with 40 to 75% case fatality rates there are currently no vaccines or postexposure treatments licensed for combating human niv infection methods and results four groups of ferrets received a single vaccination with different recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing group 1 control with no glycoprotein group 2 the niv fusion protein f group 3 the niv attachment protein g and group 4 a combination of the niv f and g proteins animals were challenged intranasally with niv 28 days after vaccination control ferrets in group 1 showed characteristic clinical signs of niv disease including respiratory distress neurological disorders viral load in blood and tissues and gross lesions and antigen in target tissues all animals in this group succumbed to infection by day 8 importantly all specifically vaccinated ferrets in groups 2-4 showed no evidence of clinical illness and survived challenged all animals in these groups developed anti-niv f and/or g igg and neutralizing antibody titers while niv rna was detected in blood at day 6 post challenge in animals from groups 2-4 the levels were orders of magnitude lower than animals from control group 1 conclusions these data show protective efficacy against niv in a relevant model of human infection further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective single injection vaccines for niv infection
senecavirus a sv-a formerly seneca valley virus svv has been detected in swine with vesicular lesions and is thought to be associated with swine idiopathic vesicular disease sivd a vesicular disease syndrome that lacks a defined causative agent the clinical presentation of sivd resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease fmd swine vesicular disease svd and vesicular stomatitis vs that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to lift restrictions on animal quarantine movement and trade this study presents the development of a sensitive sybr green rt-qpcr assay suitable for detection of sv-a in diagnostic swine specimens after testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease 44 88% were found to be positive for sv-a by rt-qpcr as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population sv-a rna was also detectable at a low level in sera from a subset of pigs that presented with 18% or without 6% vesicular signs in 2015 there has been an increase in the occurrence of sv-a in the us and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method sv-a rna was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions oral and snout epithelium oral swabs scabs and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates fig 2 dna doubling efficiency linear amplification of circular plasmid dna was between copy numbers of 4 x 10 0 and 4 x 10 6 and generated a standard curve with calculated efficiency of 86% from y-slope -3.72 with correlation coefficient r 2 of 0.9993
the rising incidence of emerging infectious diseases eid is mostly linked to biodiversity loss changes in habitat use and increasing habitat fragmentation bats are linked to a growing number of eid but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats these may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs we investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of african bats 8 pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera in central and west africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny we performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution defined as the perimeter to area ratio with viral richness in bats because of their potential effect sampling effort host body weight ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour migration and geographical range were included into the analysis as variables the results showed that the geographical distribution size shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission two potential explanations may explain these results a positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches alternatively parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites this study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in africa
the recombinant nucleocapsid protein rnp of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov was expressed in a baculovirus system the purified sars-cov rnp was used as an antigen for detection of sars-cov antibodies in igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa the elisa was evaluated in comparison with neutralizing antibody assay and the authentic sars-cov antigen-based igg elisa two-hundred and seventy-six serum samples were collected from health care workers in a hospital in which a nosocomial sars outbreak took place and used for evaluation the sars-cov rnp-based igg elisa has 92% of sensitivity and specificity compared with the neutralizing antibody assay and 94% sensitivity and specificity compared with the authentic sars-cov antigen-based igg elisa the results suggest that the newly developed sars-cov rnp-based igg elisa is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological study of sars the sars-cov rnp-based igg elisa has an advantage over the conventional igg elisa in that the antigen can be prepared by laboratory workers without the risk of infection
to determine how long antibodies against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus persist we measured long-term antibody responses among persons serologically positive or indeterminate after a 2012 outbreak in jordan antibodies including neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 6 86% of 7 persons for at least 34 months after the outbreak
rotaviruses are the leading cause and coronaviruses are the major contributors of acute gastroenteritis in the young of various mammalian and avian species despite numerous trials and decades of research vaccines have limited efficacy particularly for calves as an alternative method of controlling infection we have investigated broad spectrum antiviral agents that are not discriminatory among various viruses this report involves testing a variety of adsorbent agents including charcoal clay and clay minerals to adsorb rotavirus and coronavirus in vitro results revealed that all the adsorbent agents had good to excellent capability of adsorbing rotavirus and excellent capability of adsorbing coronavirus percent adsorptions ranged from 78.74% to 99.89% for rotavirus and 99.99% for coronavirus while sand negative control was <0.01%. a high affinity binding was present as determined by a low percent desorption 0.06±3.09%. however the adsorbent bound virus complex retained and may have actually enhanced infectivity #
pteropine orthoreoviruses prv are emerging bat-borne viruses with proven zoonotic transmission we recently demonstrated human exposure to prv in singapore which together with previous reports from malaysia and vietnam suggest that human infection of prv may occur periodically in the region this raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection in this study we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in singapore for evidence of exposure to prv3m also known as melaka virus which was first isolated from human patients in melaka malaysia we found that 67 serum samples were prv3m positive by elisa and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay to investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for prv transmission we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with prv3m and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals viral rna was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted additionally one of the uninfected animals seroconverted implying active shedding and transmission of prv3m we provide evidence that prv exposure in the macaque population in singapore occurs at a relatively high prevalence and this study suggests that cynomolgus macaques may be an intermediate or reservoir host for prvs
coronaviruses covs act as cross-species viruses and have the potential to spread rapidly into new host species and cause epidemic diseases despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome cov mers-cov there are currently no drugs available for their treatment therefore broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic covs are urgently needed to search for effective inhibitory agents we performed high-throughput screening hts of a 2000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically engineered human cov oc43 hcov-oc43 strain expressing renilla luciferase roc43-ns2del-rluc and validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct covs in vitro we screened 56 hits from the hts data and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type hcov-oc43 furthermore we identified seven compounds lycorine emetine monensin sodium mycophenolate mofetil mycophenolic acid phenazopyridine and pyrvinium pamoate as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four covs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations additionally we found that emetine blocked mers-cov entry according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected balb/c mice against hcov-oc43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system this represents the first demonstration of in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of hcov-oc43 in a mouse model these results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against cov infection importance currently there is no approved therapy to treat coronavirus infection therefore broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic covs are needed based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library we identified seven compounds with broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four covs in vitro additionally one compound lycorine was found to protect balb/c mice against hcov-oc43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system this inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel cov infections in the future
• bats in trinidad were screened for selected viruses including several of zoonotic and public health significance.• serological evidence of the past infection with veev tabv rbv and an undetermined flaviviruses was detected.• factors associated with bats being seropositive for tabv included bat species location and feeding preference and for veev roost type and location were associated a serosurvey of antibodies against selected flaviviruses and alphaviruses in 384 bats representing 10 genera and 14 species was conducted in the caribbean island of trinidad sera were analysed using epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisas specific for antibodies against west nile virus wnv venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev and eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev all of which are zoonotic viruses of public health significance in the region overall the elisas resulted in the detection of veevspecific antibodies in 11 2.9% of 384 bats antibodies to wnv and eeev were not detected in any sera of the 384 sera 308 were also screened using hemagglutination inhibition assay hia for antibodies to the aforementioned viruses as well as st louis encephalitis virus slev which also causes epidemic disease in humans rio bravo virus rbv tamana bat virus tabv and western equine encephalitis virus weev using this approach antibodies to tabv and rbv were detected in 47 15.3% and 3 1.0% bats respectively hia results also suggest the presence of antibodies to an undetermined flaviviruses in 8 2.6% bats seropositivity for tabv was significantly p < 0.05 v 2 associated with bat species location and feeding preference and for veev with roost type and location differences in prevalence rates between urban and rural locations were statistically significant p < 0.05 v 2 for tabv only none of the aforementioned factors was significantly associated with rbv seropositivity rates
the aerosol form of the bacterium yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague a rapidly fatal disease at present no plague vaccines are available for use in the united states one candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the y pestis virulence v antigen a protein that mediates the function of the yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammato y responses in the host on the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus ad gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective ad genetransfer vector encoding the y pestis v antigen adsecv could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration adsecv elicited specifi t cell responses and high igg titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization importantly the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of y pestis co92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of adsecv these observations suggest that an ad gene-transfer vector expressing v antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine
the present study describes detection of picobirnavirus pbv in faecal samples from bovine and buffalo calves employing the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page a total of 136 faecal samples from buffalo n=122 and cow calves n=14 exhibiting clinical signs of diarrhoea and from healthy calves were collected during 2007-2010 from subtropical central india and tarai area of western temperate himalayan foothills uttarakhand the dsrna nature of the virus was confirmed by nuclease treatment rnase a rnaset1 and dnase 1 page results confirmed 3.67% 5/136 positivity for pbv showing a typical genomic migration pattern with two discrete bands with size of approximately 2.4 and 1.7 kbps for the larger and smaller segments respectively among the five pbv samples identified three were from buffalo calves and one from cow calf exhibiting clinical signs of acute diarrhoea while one sample from non-diarrhoeic buffalo calf also showed the presence of pbv none of the samples showed dual infection of rotavirus and pbv the preliminary findings indicate sporadic incidences of pbv in bovine calves and emphasize the need for the development of better diagnostics for early detection and genetic characterization of these emerging isolates of farm animals of economic significance
reserve wr results in an acute infection of the lung followed by dissemination of the virus to other organs and causes lethality in mice the mechanisms of lethality are not well-understood in this study we analyzed virus replication and host immune responses after intranasal infection with lethal and non-lethal doses of vv using the wr strain and the less virulent wyeth strain the wr strain replicated more vigorously in the lung and in the brain than the wyeth strain there were however no differences between the virus titers in the brains of mice infected with the higher lethal dose and the lower non-lethal dose of wr strain suggesting that the amount of virus replication in the brain is unlikely to be the sole determining factor of lethality the wr strain grew better in primary mouse lung cells than the wyeth strain lethal infection with wr strain was associated with a reduced number of lymphocytes and an altered phenotype of the t cells in the lung compared to non-lethal infections with the wr or wyeth strains severe thymus atrophy with a reduction of cd4 and cd8 double positive t cells was also observed in the lethal infection these results suggest that the lethality induced by intranasal infection with a high dose of the wr strain is caused by the higher replication of virus in lung cells and immune suppression during the early phase of the infection resulting in uncontrolled virus replication in the lung
vaccination is the mainstay of preventative medicine for many infectious diseases pregnant women unborn fetuses and neonates represent three at-risk populations that can be simultaneously protected by strategic vaccination protocols because the pathogenesis of different infectious microbes varies based on tissue tropism timing of infection and host susceptibility the goals of immunization are not uniform across all vaccines mechanistic understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis and immune responses is therefore essential to inform vaccine design and the implementation of appropriate immunization protocols that optimize protection of pregnant women fetuses and neonates
mucosal vaccination against amoebiasis using the gal-lectin of e histolytica has been proposed as one of the leading strategies for controlling this human disease however most mucosal adjuvants used are toxic and the identification of safe delivery systems is necessary here we evaluate the potential of a recombinant autographa californica baculovirus driving the expression of the lc3 fragment of the gal-lectin to confer protection against amoebic liver abscess ala in hamsters following oral or nasal immunization hamsters immunized by oral route showed complete absence 57.9% or partial development 21% of ala resulting in some protection in 78.9% of animals when compared with the wild type baculovirus and sham control groups in contrast nasal immunization conferred only 21% of protection efficacy levels of ala protection showed lineal correlation with the development of an anti-amoebic cellular immune response evaluated in spleens but not with the induction of seric igg anti-amoeba antibodies these results suggest that baculovirus driving the expression of e histolytica vaccine candidate antigens is useful for inducing protective cellular and humoral immune responses following oral immunization and therefore it could be used as a system for mucosal delivery of an anti-amoebic vaccine
attaching and effacing ae lesions are produced among others by enteropathogenic escherichia coli and enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec which differs from the former by the production of cytotoxins active on various cell cultures the verocytotoxins or shigacytotoxins ehec are associated with diarrhoea and dysentery in humans and in ruminants mainly calves from two to eight weeks of age clinical signs and/or lesions have been reproduced experimentally with ehec strains belonging to serotypes o5k4/nm o26k-h11 o111nm and o157h7 which are isolated from cattle and/or humans the purpose of this work was to develop an experimental model of infection in newborn calves with a bovine ehec strain isolated from a calf which of died of diarrhoea and belonging to the o118h16 serotype which is also common to both cattle and humans the bovine o118h16 ehec strain was able to colonize the gut of three newborn calves and to induce diarrhoea twenty-four hours after challenge and to produce ae lesions in the small and/or large intestines ae lesions were detected microscopically and ultrastructurally in the small intestine of one calf and in the whole intestinal track of two calves internalization of bacteria and also of pedestal-bacteria complex inside of the enterocyte was observed in two of the three calves the significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria the challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves but not from other organs or from heart blood no blood was observed in the faeces of any of the three calves nor were any lesions in the internal organs which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin whose role is still unknown in cattle © 2000 éditions scientifiques et médicales elsevier sasenterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec / calf / attaching and effacing lesions ae / diarrhoea / invasion
vaccines save millions of lives each year from various life-threatening infectious diseases and there are more than 20 vaccines currently licensed for human use worldwide moreover in recent decades immunotherapy has become the mainstream therapy which highlights the tremendous potential of immune response mediators including vaccines for prevention and treatment of various forms of cancer however despite the tremendous advances in microbiology and immunology there are several vaccine preventable diseases which still lack effective vaccines classically weakened forms attenuated of pathogenic microbes were used as vaccines although the attenuated microbes induce effective immune response a significant risk of reversion to pathogenic forms remains while in the twenty-first 40 century with the advent of genetic engineering microbes can be tailored with desired properties in this review i have focused on the use of genetically modified bacteria for the delivery of vaccine antigens more specifically the live-attenuated bacteria derived from pathogenic bacteria possess many features that make them highly suitable vectors for the delivery of vaccine antigens bacteria can theoretically express any heterologous gene or can deliver mammalian expression vectors harboring vaccine antigens dna vaccines these properties of live-attenuated microbes are being harnessed to make vaccines against several infectious and noninfectious diseases in this regard i have described the desired features of live-attenuated bacterial vectors and the mechanisms of immune responses manifested by live-attenuated bacterial vectors interestingly anaerobic bacteria are naturally attracted to tumors which make them suitable vehicles to deliver tumor-associated antigens thus i have discussed important studies investigating the role of bacterial vectors in immunotherapy finally i have provided important discussion on novel approaches for improvement and tailoring of live-attenuated bacterial vectors for the generation of desired immune responses
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a highly infectious intestinal disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv a pedv strain was isolated from the piglet intestinal tract in vero cells in jiangsu province designated as the js-a strain pedv was identified as the isolated virus by cytopathology immunofluorescence assay western blotting transmission electron microscopy and sequence analysis the full-length genome of the js-a isolate and the s gene were systematically analyzed indicating that pedv js-a belongs to the g2a subtype which is closely related to the prevalent pedv in many countries and different from many current vaccines animal regression tests showed that piglets that are orally infected with the virus continue to develop diarrhea with yellowish and unpleasant odors further piglets showed reduced food consumption and weight loss in the challenged group while there were no abnormalities in the control group in addition toll-like receptors tlrs rig-i and the downstream medium gene in the intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs infected with pedv js-a strain were studied the neonatal fc receptor fcrn was the only igg transport receptor and protected igg from degradation therefore pedv js-a infection might inhibit fcrn expression by downregulating tlrs and downstream signaling molecules taken together isolation of the js-a variant contributes to evolutionary analysis of the diarrhea virus further the experimental infection model lays a foundation for further research related to vaccine development and the antiviral natural immune response of infected piglets which helps us to better understand pedv pathogenesis and immune mechanism
china the viruses were isolated from flocks which suffered from either respiratory disease or nephritis and the majority had not been vaccinated against ibv six strains were shown by monoclonal antibodies to differ from h120 connecticut and arkansas 99 strains of ibv and also to differ from each other four of these strains were serotyped one nrz was of the massachusetts serotype three hv nb-90 and tj shared a degree of antigenic similarity and were of a serotype that differed from massachusetts and connecticut nb-90 was similar to both gray and t strains whereas tj shared some similarity with the t strain four strains hv nb-90 yy and tj induced 33 47 60 and 90% mortality respectively in 3-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens clinical signs and post-mortem findings were identical to those induced by the nephropathogenic t strain chickens vaccinated with h120 strain and then challenged with four highly pathogenic strains hv nb-90 yy and tj were not protected as determined by both virus isolation and mortality the results show that highly pathogenic ibv strains which induce clinical nephritis occur frequently in poultry flocks in china they also confirm field observations on the lack of protection by currently used ib vaccines of the massachusetts serotype against challenge with these nephropathogenic strains
the antiviral properties of zeolite sodium aluminosilicate powders amended with metal ions were assessed using human coronavirus 229e feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and feline calicivirus f-9 zeolites containing silver and silver/copper caused significant reductions of coronavirus 229e after 1 h in suspension the silver/copper combination yielded a . of note it was effective against both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses metal-zeolites could therefore possibly be used in applications to reduce virus contamination of fomites and thus the spread of viral diseases
porcine respiratory coronavirus is related genetically to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus with a large deletion in s protein the respiratory virus is a mutated form that may be a consequence of the gastroenteritis virus's evolution intensive passages of the virus in its natural host may enhance the appearance of mutations and therefore may contribute to any attenuated form of the virus the objective of this study was to characterize the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus tmk22 strain after passages in piglets from 1992 until 2007 a typical experimental infection molecular characterization and serological analysis were also carried out to further characterize and to evaluate any significant difference between strains the sequence analysis showed two amino acid deletions and loss of an n-glycosylation site in transmissible gastroenteritis virus s protein after passages in piglets although these deletions were positioned at the beginning of the antigenic site b of s protein no clinical differences were observed in piglets infected experimentally either with the native virus or the mutated one serological tests did not show any antibody reactivity difference between the two strains in this article we report that the s protein deletion did not affect the virus's pathogenicity the variety of the virus's evolutionary forms may be a result not only of the multiple passages in natural hosts but also of other factors such as different pathogens co-infection nutrition immunity and others further studies need to be carried out to characterize the mutated strain
canine visceral leishmaniasis leishmania chagasi in vitro microbicidal analysis macrophage cd4 and cd8 t cells a b s t r a c t canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl is a parasitic disease endemic in many countries and dogs present as the major natural reservoir of the parasite leishmania chagasi syn l infantum biomarkers in the canine immune system is an important technique in the course of developing vaccines and treatment strategies against cvl new methodologies for studying the immune response of dogs during leishmania infection and after receiving vaccines and treatments against cvl would be useful in this context we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from healthy dogs to evaluate procedures related to i establishment of in vitro conditions of monocytes differentiated into macrophages infected with l chagasi and ii purification procedures of t-cell subsets cd4 + and cd8 + using microbeads our data demonstrated that after 5 days of differentiation macrophages were able to induce significant phagocytic and microbicidal activity after l chagasi infection and also showed increased frequency of parasitism and a higher parasite load although
transmission of viruses from the commercial poultry to wild birds is an emerging paradigm of livestockwildlife interface here we report the identification and isolation of vaccine strains of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 apmv1 and avian coronaviruses acov from different wild bird species across eight egyptian governorates between january 2014 and december 2015 surveillance of avian respiratory viruses in free-ranging wild birds n = 297 identified three species that harboured or excreted apmv1 and acovs genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of recovered viruses revealed a close association with the most widely utilized vaccine strains in the country these results highlight the potential spillover of vaccine-viruses probably due to extensive use of live-attenuated vaccines in the commercial poultry and close interaction between domesticated and wild bird populations further exploring the full spectrum of vaccine-derived viral vaccine strains in wild birds might help to assess the emergence of future wild-birds origin viruses crown

middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a novel zoonotic virus that causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatality rate close to 40% but for which no vaccines are available here we evaluated the utility of chadox1 a promising replication-deficient simian adenovirus vaccine vector platform with an established safety profile in humans and dromedary camels for mers-cov vaccine development using a transgenic lethal balb/c mers-cov mouse model we showed that single dose intranasal or intramuscular immunisation with chadox1 mers encoding full-length mers-cov spike glycoprotein is highly immunogenic and confers protection against lethal viral challenge immunogenicity and efficacy were comparable between immunisation routes together these data provide support for further evaluation of chadox1 mers vaccine in humans and dromedary camels the animal reservoir of infection
limited sampling means that relatively little is known about the diversity and evolutionary history of mammalian members of the hepadnaviridae genus orthohepadnavirus an important case in point are shrews the fourth largest group of mammals but for which there is limited knowledge on the role they play in viral evolution and emergence here we report the discovery of a novel shrew hepadnavirus the newly discovered virus denoted shrew hepatitis b virus shbv is divergent to be considered a new species of orthohepadnavirus phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses were usually most closely related to tbhbv tent-making bat hepatitis b virus known to be able to infect human hepatocytes and had a similar genome structure although shbv fell in a more basal position in the surface protein phylogeny in sum these data suggest that shrews are natural hosts for hepadnaviruses and may have played an important role in their long-term evolution
memory b-cells mbcs are potential antibody secreting immune cells that differentiate and mature following host exposure to a pathogen following differentiation mbcs remain in peripheral circulation after recovery and are poised to secrete antigen-specific antibodies if and when they are re-exposed to their cognate antigen consequently mbcs form the founder population and provide one of the first lines of pathogen-specific defense against reinfection the role mbcs play is complicated for viruses that are heterologous such as dengue virus denv which exist as antigenically different serotypes on second infection with a different serotype mbcs from initial dengue infection rapidly proliferate and secrete antibodies many of these mbc derived antibodies will be cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing while some antibodies may recognize epitopes conserved across serotypes and have the capacity to broadly neutralize 2 or more serotypes it is also possible that a new population of mbcs and antibodies specific for the second virus serotype need to arise for long-term broader immunity to develop methods to interrogate and track memory b cell responses are important for evaluating both natural immunity and vaccine response however the low abundance of mbcs for any specific pathogen makes it challenging to interrogate frequency specificity and breadth for the pathogen of interest this review discusses current approaches that have been used to interrogate the memory b cell immune response against viral pathogens in general and denv specifically including strengths limitations and future directions single-cell approaches could help uncover the denv specific mbc antibody repertoire and improved methods for isolating denv specific monoclonal antibodies from human peripheral blood cells would allow for a functional analysis of the anti-denv repertoire

background early detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv infection of swine is necessary to control this devastating disease by monitoring host serum antibodies to viral antigens early virus detection within herds is feasible in this study recombinant antigens were generated using recombinant dna techniques to fuse prrsv structural protein n or nonstructural protein 1α nsp1α with the rellina luciferase gene next fused genes were cloned into plasmids and transfected into hek-293 t cells for transient expression upon coincubation of lysates with pig sera antigen-antibody complexes formed that bound to protein-g coated onto microplates by further measurement of luminance value a modified form of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems namely luciferase-linked antibody capture assay laca was developed for detection of prrsv-specific antibodies results known anti-prrsv antibody-positive or -negative serum samples 125 and 122 samples respectively were used to validate the laca and compared it with idexx prrs ×3 elisa based on the result n-rluc and nsp1α-rluc laca results were 95.3 and 94.4% in agreement with idexx elisa suggested a similar specificity of laca to idexx elisa moreover when both laca and idexx elisa were used to evaluate sequential serum samples obtained from prrsv experimentally infected pigs the prrsv-specific antibody response was detectable as early as 3 days postinoculation dpi using n-rluc laca but undetectable until 7 dpi using idexx elisa suggesting an improved sensitivity of laca meanwhile antibodies specific for nsp1α were detected at higher levels overall but were undetectable until 10 dpi furthermore notably one idexx elisa positive result was not confirmed by laca or ifa and was thus considered a false-positive result conclusion the laca exhibited similar specificity but improved sensitivity to that of the commercial idexx prrs ×3 elisa kit for detection of prrsv-specific antibodies in pig serum importantly laca could be adapted for detecting antibodies against other prrsv targets such as nsp1α to achieve earlier detection of prrsv infection

yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease yel-avd is a rare complication of yellow fever yf vaccination a previously healthy 22-year-old female died following yf vaccination despite aggressive measures serial viral load titers cytokine levels and host genetic factors were evaluated in an attempt to understand this unusual and lethal outcome the patient's high-titer vaccine viremia and possibly related minor genetic anomalies provide clues to exploring the etiology of yel-avd
background western european porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv strains cause limited and mild clinical signs whereas more virulent strains are circulating in eastern europe the emergence of such highly virulent strains in western europe might result in severe clinical problems and a financial disaster in this context the efficacy of the commercial modified-live prrsv subtype 1 vaccine unistrain ® prrs was tested upon challenge with the east european subtype 3 prrsv strain lena results the mean duration of fever was shortened and the number of fever days was significantly lower in vaccinated pigs than in control pigs moreover a lower number of vaccinated animals showed fever respiratory disorders and conjunctivitis the mean virus titers in the nasal secretions post challenge auc were significantly lower in the vaccinated group than in the control group the duration of viremia was slightly shorter not significantly different in the vaccinated group as compared to the control group conclusions vaccination of pigs with the modified-live vaccine unistrain ® prrs provides a partial clinical and virological protection against the prrsv subtype 3 strain lena
nipah virus niv is a highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis and respiratory disease in humans there is currently no approved therapeutic for human use against niv infection griffithsin grft is high-mannose oligosaccharide binding lectin that has shown in vivo broad-spectrum activity against viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus human immunodeficiency virus 1 hepatitis c virus and japanese encephalitis virus in this study we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities of grft and its synthetic trimeric tandemer 3mg against niv and other viruses from across 4 virus families the 3mg had comparatively greater potency than grft against niv due to its enhanced ability to block niv glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation our initial in vivo prophylactic evaluation of an oxidation-resistant grft q-grft showed significant protection against lethal niv challenge in syrian golden hamsters our results warrant further development of q-grft and 3mg as potential niv therapeutics
following oral inoculation the excretion of a virulent or an attenuated strain of bovine coronavirus in calf feces and their persistence in spiral colon ileum and jejunum were studied using hemagglutination and direct fluorescent antibody tests respectively the virus was excreted in feces for only 3 days at high titers and then intermittently at low titers however viral antigen was detected in crypt or peyer's patches for at least 3 weeks after infection in 1 of 3 calves given virulent virus and 1 of 2 calves given attenuated virus bovine coronavirus bcv is an important cause of diarrhea in calves of 3-21 days of age . this virus is known to cause a more severe disease and higher mortalities than those caused by the bovine rotavirus because it multiplies in both the small intestine and the large intestine whereas the rotavirus infects only the small intestine . the main route of infection is the fecal-oral and the pregnant cows are believed to be important sources of virus for newborn calves cows have been reported to be chronic excretors of bcv the shedding being exacerbated in late stages of gestation probably because of hormonal changes and their effects on the immune system .an attenuated virus vaccine is available to control bcv diarrhea but has not been found to be efficacious in protecting from infection under experimental conditions or in the field in colostrum-fed calves . to determine the reasons for vaccine failure information is needed on the replication sites titers and persistence of bcv following infection information is also needed on the mode of presentation of the antigen to the immune sytem as well as the extent of mucosal immune responses engendered by bcv
background passively acquired maternal derived immunity mdi is a double-edged sword maternal derived antibodymediated immunity ami and cell-mediated immunity cmi are critical immediate defenses for the neonate however mdi may interfere with the induction of active immunity in the neonate i e passive interference the effect of antigen-specific mdi on vaccine-induced ami and cmi responses to mycoplasma hyopneumoniae m hyopneumoniae was assessed in neonatal piglets to determine whether cmi and ami responses could be induced in piglets with mdi piglets with high and low levels of maternal m hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against m hyopneumoniae at 7 d of age piglet m hyopneumoniae-specific antibody lymphoproliferation and delayed type hypersensitivity dth responses were measured 7 d and 14 d post vaccination results piglets with m hyopneumoniae-specific mdi failed to show vaccine-induced ami responses there was no rise in m hyopneumoniae antibody levels following vaccination of piglets in the presence of m hyopneumoniae-specific mdi however piglets with m hyopneumoniae-specific mdi had primary antigen-specific lymphoproliferation and secondary dth m hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses following vaccination conclusions in this study neonatal m hyopneumoniae-specific cmi was not subject to passive interference by mdi further it appears that both maternal derived and endogenous cmi contribute to m hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses in piglets vaccinated in the face of mdi
a phylogeny has been calculated by maximum likelihood comparisons of the concatenated consensus protein sequences of 29 tobamoviruses shown to be non-recombinant this phylogeny has statistically significant support throughout including its basal branches the viruses form eight lineages that are congruent with the taxonomy of the hosts from which each was first isolated and with the exception of three of the twenty-nine species all fall into three clusters that have either asterid or rosid or caryophyllid hosts i e the major subdivisions of eudicotyledonous plants a modified mantel permutation test showed that the patristic distances of virus and host phylogenies are significantly correlated especially when the three anomalously placed viruses are removed when the internal branches of the virus phylogeny were collapsed the congruence decreased the simplest explanation of this congruence of the virus and host phylogenies is that most tobamovirus lineages have co-diverged with their primary plant hosts for more than 110 million years and only the brassica-infecting lineage originated from a major host switch from asterids to rosids their co-divergence seems to have been 'fuzzy' rather than 'strict' permitting viruses to switch hosts within major host clades our conclusions support those of a coalesence analysis of tobamovirus sequences that used proxy node dating but not a similar analysis of nucleotide sequences from dated samples which concluded that the tobamoviruses originated only 100 thousand years ago
cross-neutralization between rabies virus rabv and two european bat lyssaviruses eblv-1 and -2 was analysed using lentiviral pseudotypes as antigen vectors glycoprotein g-protein cdna from rabv challenge virus standard-11 cvs-11 and eblv-1 and -2 were cloned and co-expressed with human immunodeficiency virus hiv or murine leukemia virus mlv gagpol and packageable green fluorescent protein gfp or luciferase reporter genes in human cells the harvested lentiviral hiv vector infected over 40 % of baby hamster kidney bhk target cells providing high-titre pseudotype stocks tests on blinded antibody-positive n515 and -negative n545 sera predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization favn test approved by the world health organization who and office international des epizooties oie revealed that the cvs-11 pseudotype assay had 100 % concordance with favn and strongly correlated with neutralization titres r 2 50.89 cross-neutralization tests using sera from rabvvaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with cvs-11 eblv-1 and eblv-2 envelopes showed that the relative neutralization titres correlated broadly with the degree of g-protein diversity pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests i they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories ii the use of reporter genes such as gfp or b-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide iii each assay requires 10 ml serum this robust microassay will improve our understanding of the protective humoral immunity that current rabies vaccines confer against emerging lyssaviruses and will be applicable to surveillance studies thus helping to control the spread of rabies a supplementary figure and two supplementary tables are available with the online version of this paper
rotavirus rv belonging to reoviridae family is the leading cause of acute severe viral diarrhea in children under 5 years old and infant animals worldwide although vaccines are commonly used to prevent infection episodes of diarrhea caused by rv frequently occur thus this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against rv infection in piglets following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks the piglets were orally challenged with rv we found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by rv infection resveratroltreatment inhibited the tnf-α production indicating that the anti-rv activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response the ifn-γ level was elevated in 10mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group and 30mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group after rv infection the ratios of cd4+/cd8+ in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in rvinfected piglets it was found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by rv infection these results revealed that resveratrol dry suspension could be a new control measure for rv infection open access citation cui q fu q zhao x song x yu j yang y et al 2018 protective effects and immunomodulation on piglets infected with rotavirus following resveratrol supplementation plos one 132 e0192692 https//doi org/ 10
pedv is mainly transmitted by the oro-fecal route although pedv shedding in semen has already been shown for an s-non-indel pedv strain infection the aim of this study was to determine if pedv can be shed in semen from spf specific pathogens free boars infected by a french s-indel pedv strain pedv/fr/001/2014 and in case of positive semen to determine the infectivity of that semen both infected boars had diarrhea after inoculation and shed virus in feces pedv genome was also detected by rt-qpcr in the sperm-rich fraction of semen 6.94 × 10 3 and 4.73 × 10 3 genomic copies/ml from the two boars infected with the s-indel pedv strain but only once at 7dpi in addition pedv rna in peyer's patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes was also present for the two inoculated boars the pedv positive semen s-non-indel and s-indel sampled during a previous trial and in this boar trial were inoculated to six spf weaned pigs the inoculated piglets did not seroconvert and did not shed virus throughout the duration of the study except for one pig at 18 dpi but pedv could be detected in intestinal tissues such as duodenum jejunum and jejunum peyer's patches by rt-qpcr except for one pig even if pedv genome has been detected in semen experimental infection of piglets with positive semen failed to conclude to the infectivity of the detected pedv
parker's rat coronavirus prc is a naturally-occurring viral infection of the laboratory rat on the first passage atcc strain 8190 of prc replicated in l-2 cells using the tenth passage of prc in l-2 cells the characteristics of the virus were compared with previous studies of sialodacryoadenitis virus sdav replicated in l-2 cells based on light and immunofluorescence microscopic examination of control and inoculated cell cultures prc-associated cpe was frequently confined primarily to individual cells and there were relatively few syncytial giant cells maximum titers were recovered at 36 h post inoculation pi infectious virus was demonstrated at ph values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 and a ph of 7.5 was determined to produce the highest titers of prc the optimum temperature for viral replication was 33 °c up to 15 passages of prc in l-929 cells failed to produce detectable virus however after adaptation in l-2 cells 20th passage prc replicated to high titers in l-929 cells previously in vitro studies of rat coronaviruses have been hampered by the lack of an identified continuous cell line to replicate these viruses in the laboratory l-2 cells represent a readily-available continuous cell line that can support the replication of relatively high titers of prc
porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is an enteric coronaviral infection that causes severe morbidity and mortality in suckling pigs but less severe disease in older pigs consequently it causes significant economic losses to the pork industry there are limited studies on the innate immune responses to ped virus pedv in pigs the aims of our study were to investigate differences in innate immune responses to pedv infection in suckling and weaned pigs and to examine if disease severity coincides with reduced innate immune responses weaned 26-day-old pigs n = 20 and 9-day-old nursing pigs n = 20 were assigned to pedv inoculated or uninoculated control groups the pigs were observed daily for clinical signs virus shedding and were euthanized at post-inoculation days pids 1 and 5 to assay immune responses blood samples were collected at pids 1 3 and 5 the natural killer nk cell frequencies nk cell activities lysis of target k562 tumor cells in vitro cd3+cd4+ t cell and cd3+cd8+ t cell frequencies were measured in blood and ileum at pids 1 and 5 the pedv infected suckling pigs showed severe diarrhea and vomiting at pid 1 whereas the pedv infected weaned pigs showed milder clinical signs starting at pid 3 pedv infected suckling pigs had significantly higher diarrhea scores earlier fecal pedv rna shedding and significantly higher viremia viral rna in serum compared to weaned pigs there was no mortality in either infected suckling or infected weaned pigs the control pigs not inoculated with pedv did not show any clinical signs and no detectable fecal or serum pedv rna strikingly pedv infected suckling pigs had significantly lower nk cell frequencies undetectable nk cell activity and lower ifn␥ producing nk cells in blood and ileum compared to pedv infected weaned pigs pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of pedv infected suckling pigs differed from those of pedv infected weaned pigs and coincided with onset of fecal pedv rna shedding and serum pedv rna titers the infected suckling pigs have higher and earlier increases in serum ifn␣ but lower serum il-8 and tnf␣ levels compared to infected weaned pigs cd3+cd4+ t cell frequencies were significantly higher in ileum of suckling pigs than in weaned pigs whereas there was no difference in cd3+cd8+ t cell frequencies in conclusion the observations of impaired lytic activity and ifn-␥ production by nk cells in suckling pigs coincided with the increased severity of pedv infection in the suckling pigs compared with the weaned pigs
seronegative persistently infected pi calves with bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv subtype 1b were vaccinated with each of four modified live virus mlv bvdv vaccines and a mannheimia haemolytica bacterin-toxoid nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes pbl were collected for virus isolation and serums were collected after vaccination and tested for bvdv1a bvdv1b bvdv2 bovine herpesvirus-1 bhv-1 bovine parainfluenza-3 virus pi-3v and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv antibodies m haemolytica and pasteurella multocida antibodies were detected using elisa procedures none of the pi calves developed mucosal disease md after mlv vaccination none of the bvdv pi calves seroconverted to bvdv1b after mlv vaccination calves receiving mlv vaccines seroconverted to the respective type/subtype in the vaccine calves receiving a mlv vaccine with noncytopathic ncp bvdv1 subtype not designated did not seroconvert to bvdv1a bvdv1b or bvdv2 the pi calves were positive for bvdv subtype 1b in the pbl and nasal swabs throughout the study calves receiving each of three vaccines with known bvdv1a strains had bvdv1a positive samples after vaccination in some but not all calves up to day 28 the pi bvdv1b calves did not respond with increased m haemolytica antibodies after vaccination compared to bvdv negative calves receiving the same m haemolytica vaccine
background sublingual s l administration of soluble protein antigens inactivated viruses or virus-like particles has been shown to induce broad immune responses in mucosal and extra-mucosal tissues recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors radvs infect mucosa surface and therefore can serve as a mucosal antigen delivery vehicle in this study we examined whether s l immunization with radv encoding spike protein s radv-s of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov induces protective immunity against sars-cov and could serve as a safe mucosal route for delivery of radv results here we show that s l administration of radv-s induced serum sars-cov neutralizing and airway iga antibodies in mice these antibody responses are comparable to those induced by intranasal i n administration in addition s l immunization induced antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses in the lungs that are superior to those induced by intramuscular immunization importantly unlike i n administration s l immunization with radv did not redirect the radv vector to the olfactory bulb conclusion our study indicates that s l immunization with radv-s is safe and effective in induction of a broad spectrum of immune responses and presumably protection against infection with sars-cov

hantaviruses are members of the bunyaviridae family carried by small mammals and causing human hemorrhagic fevers worldwide in western africa where a variety of hemorrhagic fever viruses occurs indigenous hantaviruses have been molecularly found in animal reservoirs such as rodents shrews and bats since 2006 to investigate the human contact to hantaviruses carried by these hosts and to assess the public health relevance of hantaviruses for humans living in the tropical rainforest regions of western and central africa we performed a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the region of taï national park in côte d'ivoire and the bandundu region near the salonga national park in the democratic republic dr of congo serum samples were initially screened with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using nucleoproteins of several hantaviruses as diagnostic antigens positive results were confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence testing seroprevalence rates of 3.9% 27/687 and 2.4% 7/295 respectively were found in the investigated regions in côte d'ivoire and the dr congo in côte d'ivoire this value was significantly higher than the seroprevalence rates previously reported from the neighboring country guinea as well as from south africa our study indicates an exposure of humans to hantaviruses in west and central african tropical rainforest areas in order to pinpoint the possible existence and frequency of clinical disease caused by hantaviruses in this region of the world systematic investigations of patients with fever and renal or respiratory symptoms are required
group a rotavirus rva is a major cause of diarrhea in children worldwide although rva infects many animals little is known about rva in bats the present study investigated the genetic diversity of rva in zambian bats we identified rva from two straw-colored fruit bats eidolon helvum and an egyptian fruit bat rousettus aegyptiacus and analyzed the genome sequences of these strains genome segments of the rva strains from zambian e helvum showed 97%-99% nucleotide sequence identity with those of other rva strains from e helvum in cameroon which is 2800 km from the sampling locations these findings suggest that migratory strawcolored fruit bat species distributed across sub-saharan africa have the potential to disseminate rva across long distances by contrast the rva strain from zambian r aegyptiacus carried highly divergent nsp2 and nsp4 genes leading us to propose novel genotypes n21 and e27 respectively notably this rva strain also shared the same genotype for vp6 and nsp3 with the rva strains from zambian e helvum suggesting interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment may have occurred between these two bat species in the past our study has important implications for rva dispersal in bat populations and expands our knowledge of the ecology diversity and evolutionary relationships of rva
despite its isolation and extreme climate antarctica is home to diverse fauna and associated 26 microorganisms it has been proposed that the most iconic antarctic animal the penguin 27 antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts these animals 39 may act as key virus reservoirs 40 41
respiratory viruses may infect both small and large ruminant species and can be transmitted among those of species present study reports presence and serological distribution of bovine respiratory viral infections in sheep and goats in marmara region of turkey total of 388 sera 228 from sheep and 160 from goats collected from 4 provinces were analysed neutralising antibodies specific to bvdv bhv-1 brsv pi-3 bav-1 and bav-3 were investigated among 388 serum samples 32.1% were positive for bvdv 23.0% for bhv-1 72.9% for brsv 13.2% for pi-3 86.0% for bav-1 and 93.0% for bav-3 there were significant differences observed between seroprevalence rates detected in neighbouring provinces prevalence of bvdv specific antibodies was extremely higher p=0.0009 in sheep however bhv-1 p=0.0001 and pi-3 p=0.0038 were more prevalent in goats brsv antibody prevalence was closely related to data obtained from cattle this study demonstrates that like in cattle herds brsv and adenoviruses are the possible common reason of respiratory diseases in small ruminants in the region
novel sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of international concern by who in a very short span of time the community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of china italy spain and usa among others the prophylactic solution against sars-cov-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its rna genome herein we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 with high antigenicity safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent the whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved antigenic non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against covid-19 infection these epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental sars-cov-2 strain with high efficacy the vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor tlr3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity further the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product thus this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating covid-19
immunization of pigs with a modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv vaccine initially elicits a weak interferon ifn-g response to improve the immune response an adjuvant consisting of plasmid encoding either porcine interleukin il-12 or ifn-a was co-administered during vaccination in the presence of either adjuvant at least a threefold increase in the primary virus-specific ifn-g response was observed while this enhancement was only transient 1 week when the il-12 expressing plasmid was used the effect was not only still apparent at 6 weeks after vaccination in the presence of the ifn-a expressing plasmid but even after challenge with a virulent genetically divergent prrsv in contrast no effect of either adjuvant on the production of anti-virus antibodies was noticed throughout the study despite the apparent augmentation of a t helper th 1 type response by the inclusion of ifn-a or il-12 during vaccination this modulation did not necessarily correlate with a reduction in viremia since a similar increase in the degree of the ifn-g response to the prrsv vaccine could be achieved by substituting polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in lieu of either cytokine exposure to prrsv in the presence of a variety of th 1 polarizing molecules can positively influence the development of the cell-mediated immune response of swine to this pathogen conceivably such intervention could be applied to improve the formulation of anti-prrsv vaccines #
background avian influenza a ai viruses of subtypes h5 can cause serious disease outbreaks in poultry including panzootic due to h5n1 highly pathogenic hp viruses these viruses are a threat not only for animal health but also public health due to their zoonotic potential the domestic duck plays a major role in the epidemiological cycle of influenza virus subtypes h5 but little is known concerning host/pathogen interactions during influenza infection in duck species in this study a subtracted library from duck trachea a primary site of influenza virus infection was constructed to analyse and compare the host response after a highly or low pathogenic lp h5n1-infection results here we show that more than 200 different genes were differentially expressed in infected duck trachea to a significant degree in addition significant differentially expressed genes between lpai-and hpai-infected tracheas were observed gene ontology annotation was used and specific signalling pathways were identified these pathways were different for lpai and hpai-infected tracheas except for the cxcr4 signalling pathway which is implicated in immune response a different modulation of genes in the cxcr4 signalling pathway and trim33 was induced in duck tracheas infected with a hpai-or a lpai-h5n1 conclusion first this study indicates that suppressive subtractive hybridization ssh is an alternative approach to gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza infection in ducks secondly the results indicate that cellular gene expression in the duck trachea was differently modulated after infection with a lpai-h5n1 or after infection with a hpai-h5n1 virus such difference found in infected trachea a primary infection site could precede continuation of infection and could explain appearance of respiratory symptoms or not
human coronaviruses hcov oc43 229e nl63 and hku1 are common respiratory viruses which cause various respiratory diseases including pneumonia there is a paucity of evidence on the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these four hcov strains worldwide we collected 11399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from these were tested for four strains of hcov infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr hcov-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens 4.3% 489/11399 of patients were positive for hcov of which 3.0% were positive for oc43 346/11399 0.6% for 229e 65/11399 0.5% for nl63 60/ 11399 and 0.3% for hku1 38/11399 patients aged 7-12 months had the highest prevalence of hcov and oc43 when compared with other age groups p < 0.001 the peak seasons of infection varied depending on the hcov strain patients infected with a single strain of hcov infection were less likely to present fever ≥ 38°c p = 0.014 and more likely to present pulmonary rales p = 0.043 than those co-infected with more than one hcov strain or other respiratory pathogens there were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms including coughing p = 0.032 pneumonia p = 0.026 and abnormal pulmonary rales p = 0.002 according to the strain of hcov detected this retrospective study of the prevalence of four hcov strains and clinical signs among a large population of pediatric patients in a subtropical region of china provides further insight into the epidemiology and clinical features of hcov
vaccines are biological preparations that improve immunity to particular diseases and form an important innovation of 19th century research it contains a protein that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weak or killed forms of the microbe vaccines are agents that stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the antigen now a new form of vaccine was introduced which will have the power to mask the risk side of conventional vaccines this type of vaccine was produced from plants which are genetically modified in the production of edible vaccines the gene-encoding bacterial or viral disease-causing agent can be incorporated in plants without losing its immunogenic property the main mechanism of action of edible vaccines is to activate the systemic and mucosal immunity responses against a foreign diseasecausing organism edible vaccines can be produced by incorporating transgene in to the selected plant cell at present edible vaccine are developed for veterinary and human use but the main challenge faced by edible vaccine is its acceptance by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society about its use and benefits when compared to other traditional vaccines edible vaccines are cost effective efficient and safe it promises a better prevention option from diseases
experiments almost 20 years ago demonstrated that injections of a sequence of dna encoding part of a pathogen could stimulate immunity it was soon realized that "dna vaccination" had numerous potential advantages over conventional vaccine approaches including inherent safety and a more rapid production time these and other attributes make dna vaccines ideal for development against emerging pathogens recent advances in optimizing various aspects of dna vaccination have accelerated this approach from concept to reality in contemporary human trials although not yet licensed for human use several dna vaccines have now been approved for animal health indications the rapid manufacturing capabilities of dna vaccines may be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases including the current novel h1n1 influenza a pandemic where preexisting immunity is limited because of recent advances in dna vaccination this approach has the potential to be a powerful new weapon in protecting against emerging and potentially pandemic human pathogens
the objective of this study is to evaluate the passive protective efficiency of immunoglobulin in yolk igy specific against human enterovirus type 71 ev71 the antibody was raised by intramuscular immunization to 10 white leghorn hens with inactivated human ev71 serving as the antigen the titer and specificity of the antibody were analyzed from purified igy in the egg yolks of immunized hens results indicate that the titer of igy specific against ev71 increased from the third week after the first immunization the content of total igy was 190 ± 26 mg/yolk with an average concentration of specific igy of 6.34 ± 3.38 mg/yolk in the eggs from 3 to 18 wk after immunization the results of the neutralization effect of specific igy in ev71-challenged mice demonstrate that the ev71-specific igy either by intraperitoneal injection or oral administration was able to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality in ev71 infected mice pups
even though coronavirus infection of humans is not normally associated with severe diseases the identification of the coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome showed that highly pathogenic coronaviruses can enter the human population shortly thereafter in holland in 2004 another novel human coronavirus hcov-nl63 was isolated from a seven-month old infant suffering from respiratory symptoms this virus has subsequently been identified in various countries indicating a worldwide distribution hcov-nl63 has been shown to infect mainly children and the immunocommpromised who presented with either mild upper respiratory symptoms cough fever and rhinorrhoea or more serious lower respiratory tract involvement such as bronchiolitis and croup which was observed mainly in younger children in fact hcov-nl63 is the aetiological agent for up to 10% of all respiratory diseases this review summarizes recent findings of human coronavirus hcov-nl63 infections including isolation and identification phylogeny and taxonomy genome structure and transcriptional regulation transmission and pathogenesis and detection and diagnosis
dengue virus denv is the causative agent of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever the virus is endemic in over 120 countries causing over 350 million infections per year dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct denv serotypes and evidence that under some conditions vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus while several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes instead of using whole-virus formulations we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine based on denv e-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using particle replication in non-wetting template print technology here we describe immunization studies with a denv2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate the ectodomain of denv2-e protein was expressed as a secreted recombinant protein srece purified and adsorbed to poly lactic-co-glycolic acid plga nanoparticles of different sizes and shape we show that print nanoparticle adsorbed srece without any adjuvant induces higher igg titers and a more potent denv2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble srece protein alone antigen trafficking indicate that print nanoparticle display of srece prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot our results demonstrate that print nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering subunit vaccines against flaviviruses such as dengue and zika dengue virus denv is transmitted by mosquitoes and is endemic in over 120 countries causing over 350 million infections yearly most infections are clinically unapparent but under specific conditions dengue can cause severe and lethal disease denv has 4 distinct serotypes and secondary denv infections are associated with hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome this enhancement of infection complicates vaccine development and makes it necessary to induce protective immunity against all 4 serotypes since whole virus vaccine candidates struggle to induce protective immunity we are developing a nanoparticle display vaccine approach we have expressed purified and characterized a soluble recombinant e-protein srece regardless of nanoparticle shape or size particulation of srece enhances denv specific igg titers and induces a robust long lasting neutralizing antibody response and by adsorbing srece to the nanoparticles we prolong the exposure of srece to the immune system nanoparticle display shows great promise in dengue vaccine development and possibly other mosquito-borne viruses like zika virus nanoparticle delivery of a dengue vaccine plos neglected tropical diseases |

a severe outbreak of enteric and respiratory disease associated with bovine coronavirus bcov infection is described the outbreak occurred in a dairy herd of southern italy in the first decade of september 2006 when summer temperatures were still recorded affecting calves heifers and adult cows with a marked decrease in milk production by virus isolation and rt-pcr targeting the s gene bcov was identified as the etiological agent of the outbreak whereas bacteriological parasitological and toxicological investigations failed to detect other causes of disease bcov strains with 99-100% nucleotide identity in the s gene were isolated from nasal ocular and rectal swabs thus proving the absence of separate clusters of virus on the basis of tissue tropism sequence analysis of the haemagglutination-esterase and spike proteins of the strain detected in one rectal sample 339/ 06 showed a high genetic relatedness with recent bcov isolates 98-99% amino acid identity with several unique amino acid substitutions in the s protein the bcov outbreak described in this paper presents interesting aspects i the occurrence of a severe form of disease in the warmer season ii the simultaneous presence of respiratory and enteric disease iii the involvement of young as well as adult cattle #
west nile virus wnv is prevalent in africa europe the middle east west asia and north america and causes epidemic encephalitis to date no effective therapy for wnv infection has been developed therefore there is urgent need to find an efficient method to prevent wnv disease in this study we prepared and evaluated the protective efficacy of immune serum igg and pepsin-digested fab 2 fragments from horses immunized with the wnv virus-like particles vlp expressing the wnv m and e proteins immune equine fab 2 fragments and immune horse sera efficiently neutralized wnv infection in tissue culture the passive transfer of equine immune antibodies significantly accelerated the virus clearance in the spleens and brains of wnv infected mice and reduced mortality thus equine immunoglobulin or equine neutralizing fab 2 passive immunotherapy is a potential strategy for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of patients infected with wnv
according to jerne's network hypothesis the binding site of an anti-idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign or even a self antigen in recent years antigen mimicry has been de®ned at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens however until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure to address this question we used human ige as the self structure and a well-de®ned anti-human ige mab bsw17 we describe the isolation of two antiidiotypic antibodies speci®c for the anti-ige antibody bsw17 from a non-immune human fab phage display library interestingly these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described ige peptide mimotope isolated by panning on bsw17 but they cover a much larger epitope on the ige molecule accordingly immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-af®nity antibodies with the same characteristics as bsw17 thus our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation and con®rm jerne's hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins
an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea occurred in adult cows on a dairy farm in hokkaido japan one colostrum-fed calf inoculated with pooled feces of the 5 affected cows developed mild diarrhea and shed rotavirus-like particles which reacted with antiserum to group b rotavirus in immune electron microscopy cell culture immunofluorescence tests rna-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and rt-pcr confirmed that this virus was bovine group b rotavirus which was designated the nemuro strain additional 2 colostrum-deprived calves inoculated with feces of the first calf also developed diarrhea and shed virus suggesting that this group b rotavirus might be the etiological agent of the outbreak of adult cow diarrhea the identities of the nucleotide nt and deduced amino acid aa sequences of the nemuro vp7 gene were high 93-95% in nt and 96-97% in aa and low 61-63% in nt and 49-61% in aa compared to those of the published corresponding genes from 3 bovine and 2 other mammalian human and rat strains of group b rotaviruses respectively to our knowledge this is the first report on the presence of bovine group b rotavirus in japan * rotaviruses are assigned to 6 groups a to f based on antigenic and genomic analysis . each rotavirus group possesses its own cross-reactive anti- *
fruit bats of the genus pteropus commonly known as flying-foxes are the natural hosts of several recently emerged zoonotic viruses of animal and human health significance in australia and asia including hendra and nipah viruses satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species pteropus alecto n = 5 p vampyrus n = 2 and p neohibernicus n = 2 to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region the animals were captured and released from six different locations in australia papua new guinea indonesia and timor-leste their movements were recorded for a median of 120 range 47-342 days with a median total distance travelled of 393 range 76-3011 km per individual pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between australia and papua new guinea western province on four occasions between papua new guinea western province and indonesia papua on ten occasions and to traverse torres strait on two occasions pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between timor-leste and indonesia west timor on one occasion these findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in australia new guinea and the lesser sunda islands
bats carry a variety of viruses and some of them cause public health problems macau which is famous for its gambling industry has a complex population structure the globalization in such an international metropolis has enhanced the chance of disease transmission therefore surveillance of zoonotic viruses is necessary for the early warning of potential emerging infectious diseases here we report the first surveillance of bat viruses in macau in this study we collected 1004 samples involving 10 bat species from 7 sites from april 2015 to may 2016 and examined the presence of viruses using nucleic acid-based methods coronaviruses adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses were detected in these samples with a high prevalence of coronaviruses while none was positive for hepatitis a virus hepatitis e virus or hantavirus co-infections are not common in those bat species but coronavirus hku6 and adenovirus can be found commonly occurred in myotis ricketti
objectives to evaluate faecal and clinical scores and presence of several enteropathogens possibly implicated in the development of diarrhoea in pups aged between 6 and 16 weeks independently of their health status methods pups were selected from pet shops and breeding facilities and assigned a faecal and clinical score standard isolation methods were used to determine presence of parasites viruses and bacteria in faecal samples for escherichia coli virulence genes were assessed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction results fifty-six pups were included in this study eighteen had no diarrhoea 22 had no significant clinical signs related to gastroenteritis samples were positive for toxocara canis n=29 giardia duodenalis n=35 cystoisospora n=22 e coli n=47 and clostridium perfringens n=20 in four e coli positive samples genes were detected that correlate with pathogenicity in other animal species a significant positive correlation between the presence of t canis and faecal score was found clinical significance puppies obtained from a pet shop or breeding facility have a high risk of gastrointestinal disease furthermore infectious agents may be present independently of faecal or clinical score the identification of possible pathogenic e coli strains suggests that their role in diarrhoea warrant further investigation
from the reasons that canine coronavirus ccv grows more efficiently than feline coronavirus in a cell culture and they are mutually related in their antigenicities an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using ccv-infected feline kidney crfk cells as substrate antigens was developed for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in cats it was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific elisa antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected normal crfk cells in parallel with the ccv-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen on the basis of elisa antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with ccv and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis fip cases the elisa described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous fip virus
this review focuses on the immunization of animals as a means of preventing human diseases zoonoses three frameworks for the use of vaccines in this context are described and examples are provided of successes and failures framework i vaccines are used for protection of humans and economically valuable animals where neither plays a role in the transmission cycle the benefit of collaborations between animal health and human health industries and regulators in developing such products is discussed and one example west nile vaccine of a single product developed for use in animals and humans is described framework ii vaccines are indicated for domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans the agents of concern are transmitted directly or indirectly e g via arthropod vectors from animals to humans a number of examples of the use of framework ii vaccines are provided e g against brucellosis escherischia coli o157 rabies rift valley fever venezuelan equine encephalitis and hendra virus framework iii vaccines are used to immunize wild animals as a means of preventing transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals examples are reservoirtargeted oral bait rabies mycobacterium bovis and lyme disease vaccines given the speed and lost cost of veterinary vaccine development some interventions based on the immunization of animals could lead to rapid and relatively inexpensive advances in public health opportunities for vaccine-based approaches to preventing zoonotic and emerging diseases that integrate veterinary and human medicine the one health paradigm are emphasized
two giant pandas ailuropoda melanoleuca died of unknown causes in a chinese zoo the clinical disease profile suggested that the pandas may have suffered a viral infection therefore a series of detection including virus isolation electron microscopy cytobiological assay serum neutralization and rt-pcr were used to identify the virus it was determined that the isolated virus was a canine coronavirus ccv on the basis of coronavirus neutralization by canine anti-ccv serum and 84.3% to 100% amino acid sequence similarity with ccv the results suggest that the affected pandas had been infected with ccv
sars coronavirus injected intratracheally into chickens turkeys geese ducks and quail or into the allantoic sac of their embryonating eggs failed to cause disease or replicate this finding suggests that domestic poultry were unlikely to have been the reservoir or associated with dissemination of sars coronavirus in the animal markets of southern china
tions or the recombinant adenovirus of pcdna3.1-n prime-rad-n boost regimen alone but lymphoproliferation and interferon-␥ ifn-␥ secretion were all enhanced by heterologous combination immunizations compared to homologous combinations for the reverse sequence immunization regimen lymphoproliferation ifn-␥ and ctl responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcdna3.1-n prime-rad-n boost regimen conclusion taken together of all the combinations the prime-triple boost immunization of pcdna3.1-n/pcdna3.1-n/pcdna3.1-n/ rad-n can effectively induce sars-cov-n-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice the present results suggest that dna immunization followed by recombinant adenovirus boosting could be used as a potential sars-cov vaccine in the induction of an enhanced humoral and cellular immune response
human norovirus hunov is responsible for more than 95% of outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide despite major efforts there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions against this virus chicken immunoglobulin y igy-based passive immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent and treat many enteric viral diseases here we developed a highly efficient bioreactor to generate high titers of hunov-specific igy in chicken yolks using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing hunov capsid protein rvsv-vp1 as an antigen we first demonstrated that hunov vp1 protein was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rvsv-vp1 subsequently we found that white leghorn hens immunized intramuscularly with rvsv-vp1 triggered a high level of hunov-specific yolk igy antibodies the purified yolk igy was efficiently recognized by hunov virus-like particles vlps importantly hunov-specific igy efficiently blocked the binding of hunov vlps to all three types a b and o of histo-blood group antigens hbgas the attachment factors for hunov in addition the receptor blocking activity of igy remained stable at temperature below 70 • c and at ph ranging from 4 to 9 thus immunization of hens with vsv-vp1 could be a cost-effective and practical strategy for large-scale production of anti-hunov igy antibodies for potential use as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against hunov infection

we describe herein a newly developed optical immunosensor for detection of antibodies directed against antigens of the ebola virus strains zaire and sudan we employed a photo immobilization methodology based on a photoactivatable electrogenerated polypyrrole-benzophenone film deposited upon an indium tin oxide ito modified conductive surface fiber-optic it was then linked to a biological receptor ebola virus antigen in this case on the fiber tip through a light driven reaction the photochemically modified optical fibers were tested as an immunosensor for detection of antibodies against ebola virus in animal and human sera by use of a coupled chemiluminescent reaction the immunosensor was tested for sensitivity specificity and compared to standard chemiluminescent elisa under the same conditions the analyte anti-ebola igg was detected at a low titer of 1960000 and 11000000 for subtypes zaire and sudan respectively while the same serum tested by elisa was one order 24 times less sensitive
newcastle disease virus ndv an avian virus is being evaluated for the development of vectored human vaccines against emerging pathogens previous studies of ndv-vectored vaccines in a mouse model suggested their potency after delivery by injection or by the intranasal route we compared the efficacy of various routes of delivery of ndv-vectored vaccines in a non-human primate model while delivery of an ndv-vectored vaccine by the combined intranasal/intratracheal route elicited protective immune responses delivery by the subcutaneous route or the intranasal route alone elicited limited or no protective immune responses suggesting the necessity for vaccine delivery to the lower respiratory tract furthermore direct comparison of a vaccine based on an ndv mesogenic strain ndv-bc with a similarly designed ndv vector based on a modified lentogenic strain carrying a polybasic f cleavage site ndv-vf suggested that the two ndv strains were similar in immunogenicity and were equally protective published by elsevier ltd
strains of human coronavirus hcv isolated between 1974 and 1976 have been studied in vitro and in volunteers all strains caused colds in volunteers and those cultivable in tissue culture tc produced significantly more coryza and less sore throat than strains growing only in organ culture oc the tc strains were serologically related to 229e but these isolates produced colds with a frequency and severity that contrasted with the effects of 229e itself tests on volunteers' preinfection sera showed that the prevalence of antibody to 229e had increased during the period 1961-1979 and that during 1977-1979 only 11 % of subjects had no neutralising antibody against 229e susceptibility to the 229e-related isolates pr and to was associated with low preinfection serum neutralising antibody against the homologous virus and paired sera frequently showed fourfold or greater antibody rises most commonly against the homologous strain volunteers infected with to were immune when reinoculated with the same strain approximately 1 year later but other similar volunteers were at least partly susceptible to infection with a heterologous 229e-related virus after similar time intervals although the strains of hcv that were grown in tissue culture were all related to the prototype 229e they appeared not to be identical with it and this heterogeneity is probably a significant factor in the epidemiology of hcv infections
identifi cation of new antigenic peptides derived from infectious agents or cancer cells which bind to human leukocyte antigen hla class i and ii molecules is of importance for the development of new effective vaccines capable of activating the cellular arm of the immune response however the barrier to the development of peptide-based vaccines with maximum population coverage is that the restricting hla genes are extremely polymorphic resulting in a vast diversity of peptide-binding hla specifi cities and a low population coverage for any given peptide-hla specifi city one way to reduce this complexity is to group thousands of different hla molecules into several so-called hla supertypes a classifi cation that refers to a group of hla alleles with largely overlapping peptide binding specifi cities in this chapter we focus on the state-of-the-art classifi cation of hla supertypes including hla-i supertypes and hla-ii supertypes and their application in development of peptide-based vaccines
in recent years viruses similar to those that cause serious disease in humans and other mammals have been detected in apparently healthy bats these include filoviruses paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses that cause severe diseases such as ebola virus disease marburg haemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in humans the evolution of flight in bats seem to have selected for a unique set of antiviral immune responses that control virus propagation while limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses here we summarize our current understanding of antiviral immune responses in bats and discuss their ability to co-exist with emerging viruses that cause serious disease in other mammals we highlight how this knowledge may help us to predict viral spillovers into new hosts and discuss future directions for the field
background it is unknown to what extent the human coronaviruses hcovs oc43 hku1 229e and nl63 infect healthy children frequencies of infections are only known for hospitalized children objectives comparing infection frequencies in children who have mild infections with frequencies in children needing hospital uptake will determine whether infection by one of the four hcovs leads to more severe disease in addition the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one hcov protects from infection by other hcovs study design two distinct study groups were monitored healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection hcov natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns followed 0-20 months the frequencies of severe hcovs infection was determined by real time rt-pcr among 1471 hospitalized infants <2-years old with acute respiratory tract disease results the majority of healthy children seroconverted for hcov-oc43 n = 19 and hcov-nl63 n = 17 less for hcov-hku1 n = 9 and hcov-229e n = 5 notably hcov-hku1 seroconversion was absent after hcov-oc43 infection also hcov-229e infection was rarely observed after hcov-nl63 infection 1 out of 5 in the hospital 207 14% out of 1471 children were hcov positive again we observed most infection by hcov-oc43 n = 85 and hcov-nl63 n = 60 followed by hcov-hku1 n = 47 and hcov-229e n = 15 conclusions hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 infections occur frequently in early childhood more often than hcov-hku1 or hcov-229e infections hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent hcov-hku1 and hcov-229e infection respectively which would explain why hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 are the most frequently infecting hcovs there are no indications that infection by one of the hcovs is more pathogenic than others crown
an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ac-elisa method was developed for the efficient detection of the ul24 antigen of the duck enteritis virus dev using polyclonal antibodies ducks and rabbits were immunized respectively with expressed ul24 recombinant protein the igg antibodies against ul24 from ducks and rabbits were purified and used as the capture antibodies the specificity of the optimized ac-elisa was evaluated by use of dev duck hepatitis virus dhv duck hepatitis b virus dhbv gosling plague virus gpv riemerella anatipestifer r a escherichia coli e coli pasteurella multocida p m and salmonella enteritidis s e only dev specimens yielded a specific and strong signal the limit of the sensitivity of this method for the detection of dev was 46 ng/100 l compared with pcr and virus isolation the rate of agreement for the detection of experimentally infected sera was 100%. a comparative test used on clinical specimens between the neutralization test and the ac-elisa showed that the proportions of true positives and true negatives by the ac-elisa were 0.90 and 0.67 respectively these results indicated that the ac-elisa approach is rapid sensitive and reliable for specific detection of dev antigen
public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts with its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics however datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units otus or "species" are subjective here we comprehensively sampled 1086 bats from two puerto rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm we categorized herpesviruses into 41 otus representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community although 13 otus were detected in multiple host species otus generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined only two otus showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes this work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts
severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov causes an infectious disease through respiratory route diagnosing the disease effectively and accurately at early stage is essential for preventing the disease transmission and performing antiviral treatment in this study we raised monoclonal antibodies mabs against the nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov and mapped epitopes by using different truncated n protein fragments the mapping of those epitopes was valuable for constructing pair-abs used in serological diagnosis the results showed that all of the six raised mabs were divided into two groups recognizing the region of amino acids 249-317 a group or 317-395 b group this region spanning amino acids 249-395 contains predominant b cell epitopes located at the c-terminus of n protein one pair-abs consisting of n protein-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody and sars-cov n protein-specific mab was selected to construct a sandwich elisa-kit the kit was able to specifically detect sars-cov n proteins in serum samples
a colony of domestic rabbits in tennessee usa experienced a high-mortality ~90% outbreak of enterocolitis the clinical characteristics were one to six days of lethargy bloating and diarrhea followed by death heavy intestinal coccidial load was a consistent finding as was mucoid enteropathy with cecal impaction preliminary analysis by electron microscopy revealed the presence of virus-like particles in the stool of one of the affected rabbits analysis using the virochip a viral detection microarray suggested the presence of an astrovirus and follow-up pcr and sequence determination revealed a previously uncharacterized member of that family metagenomic sequencing enabled the recovery of the complete viral genome which contains the characteristic attributes of astrovirus genomes attempts to propagate the virus in tissue culture have yet to succeed although astroviruses cause gastroenteric disease in other mammals the pathogenicity of this virus and the relationship to this outbreak remains to be determined this study therefore defines a viral species and a potential rabbit pathogen
to investigate the potential of adeno-associated viruses serotype 2 aav2-mediated rna interference rnai as an antiviral agent against rabies recombinant aav2 vectors expressing sirna targeting the nucleoprotein n gene of rabies virus rabv raav-n796 were constructed and evaluated when na cells pretreated with raav-n796 were challenged with rabv there was a 37.8 ± 3.4% to 55.1 ± 5.3% reduction in rabv virus titer when cells pre-challenged with rabv were treated with raav-n796 there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in rabv virus titer relative quantification of rabv transcripts using real-time pcr and western blot revealed that the knockdown of rabv-n gene transcripts was based on the raav-n796 inoculation titer when any na cells were treated with raav-n796 before or after challenged with rabv significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations mice treated intracerebrally with raav-n796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally respectively with lethal rabv when mice treated intramuscularly with raav-n796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal rabv they exhibited 37.5 ± 3.7% protection when mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with raav-n796 24 hr after exposure to rabv infection they exhibited 25 ± 4.1% protection the n gene mrna levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced 55 68 32 and 25% respectively these results indicated that aav2 vector-mediated sirna delivery in vitro in na cells inhibited rabv multiplication inhibited rabv multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies so it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies
diarrhea represents one of the most frequent disorders in dogs in puppies degradation of feces quality is associated with a reduced daily weight gain and an increased risk of death prevention of diarrhea in puppies requires a global approach encompassing enteropathogens environment and management practices especially when housed in groups the purpose of this study was to determine prevalence of enteropathogens in puppies in breeding kennels and to identify risk factors of diarrhea two hundred and sixty six puppies between 5 and 14 weeks of age from 29 french breeding kennels were included for each kennel data about environment management of the kennel and puppies' characteristics age sex and breed were collected for each puppy fecal consistency and fecal excretion of enteropathogens viruses and parasites was evaluated at least one enteropathogen was identified in 77.1% of puppies and 24.8% of puppies presented abnormal feces the main risk factor of weaning diarrhea was fecal excretion of canine parvovirus type 2 odds ratio = 5 confidence interval 95% 1.7-14.7 a targeted sanitary and medical prophylaxis against canine parvovirus type 2 should be implemented to decrease risk of weaning diarrhea
enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics the capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here first cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus a were pooled and sequenced on a minion reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing resulting in high sequencing depths 19.2 to 103.5x after 3 h next diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed almost all reads 99% belonged to bacteriophages which may have reshaped the piglet's microbiome contigs matched bacteroides escherichia and enterococcus phages moreover porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in belgium suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age but an association between peak of viral shedding 10 6.42 -10 7.01 copies/swab and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study retrospective analysis showed the widespread n = 25 56.8% positive of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among belgian diarrheic piglets minion enables rapid detection of enteric viruses such new methodologies will change diagnostics but more extensive validations should be conducted the true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded swine health is continuously challenged by viral infections causing enteric respiratory reproductive and general systemic diseases the etiological roles of rotaviruses and coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea have been widely accepted 12 . however several novel and poorly characterized viruses are often found in feces of pigs the clinical importance has not been addressed for most of them and they have not been included in the lists of differential diagnosis for swine veterinarians logically diagnostics are not available for such viruses shotgun viral metagenomics allows simultaneous identification of known and novel viruses present in a porcine diagnostic sample many studies have already been conducted to elucidate the composition of the fecal virome of pigs identifying several novel or poorly characterized viruses such as kobuviruses published xx xx xxxx open www nature com/scientificreports/
background toxoplasma gondii may cause abortions ocular and neurological disorders in warm-blood hosts immunized mammals are a wide source of hyperimmune sera used in different approaches including diagnosis and the study of hostparasite interactions unfortunately mammalian antibodies present limitations for its production such as the necessity for animal bleeding low yield interference with rheumatoid factor complement activation and affinity to fc mammalian receptors igy antibodies avoid those limitations therefore they could be an alternative to be applied in t gondii model in this study we immunized hens with soluble tachyzoite antigens of t gondii stag and purified egg yolk antibodies igy by an inexpensive and simple method with high yield and purity degree igy anti-stag antibodies presented high avidity and were able to recognize a broad range of parasite antigens although some marked differences were observed in reactivity profile between antibodies produced in immunized hens and mice interestingly igy antibodies against neospora caninum and eimeria spp did not react to stag we also show that igy antibodies were suitable to detect t gondii forms in paraffin-embedded sections and culture cell monolayers conclusions/significance due to its cost-effectiveness high production yield and varied range of possible applications polyclonal igy antibodies are useful tools for studies involving t gondii
infection with pantropic canine coronavirus was detected during outbreaks in france and belgium this was concurrent in most cases with canine parvovirus 2c one outbreak was a deadly acute systemic disease with a single pantropic canine coronavirus infection this is the first report of a fatality associated with pantropic canine coronavirus alone outside italy
inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov has been tested as a candidate vaccine against the reemergence of sars in order to understand the efficacy and safety of this approach it is important to know the antibody specificities generated with inactivated sars-cov in the current study a panel of twelve monoclonal antibodies mabs was established by immunizing balb/c mice with the inactivated bj01 strain of sars-cov isolated from the lung tissue of a sars-infected chinese patient these mabs could recognize sars-cov-infected cells by immunofluorescence analysis ifa seven of them were mapped to the specific segments of recombinant spike s protein six on s1 subunit aa 12-798 and one on s2 subunit aa 797-1192 high neutralizing titers against sars-cov were detected with two mabs 1a5 and 2c5 targeting at a subdomain of s protein aa 310-535 consistent with the previous report that this segment of s protein contains the major neutralizing domain some of these s-specific mabs were able to recognize cleaved products of s protein in sars-cov-infected vero e6 cells none of the remaining five mabs could recognize either of the recombinant s n m or e antigens by elisa this study demonstrated that the inactivated sars-cov was able to preserve the immunogenicity of s protein including its major neutralizing domain the relative ease with which these mabs were generated against sars-cov virions further supports that subunit vaccination with s constructs may also be able to protect animals and perhaps humans it is somewhat unexpected that no nspecific mabs were identified albeit anti-n igg was easily identified in sars-cov-infected patients the availability of this panel of mabs also provided potentially useful agents with applications in therapy diagnosis and basic research of sars-cov d
the spike s protein of coronavirus which binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection however some animal studies have suggested that inadequate immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov induces a lung eosinophilic immunopathology upon infection the present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants for use with recombinant s protein gold nanoparticles aunps which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization and tolllike receptor tlr agonists which have previously been shown to be an effective adjuvant in an ultraviolet-inactivated sars-cov vaccine all the mice immunized with more than 0.5 µg s protein without adjuvant escaped from sars after infection with mouse-adapted sars-cov however eosinophilic infiltrations were observed in the lungs of almost all the immunized mice the
here we examined the efficacy of are combinant subunit antigen-based oral vaccine for preventing porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv first we generated a soluble recombinant partial spike s1 protein ap2 from pedv in e coli and then evaluated the utility of ap2 subunit vaccine-loaded hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate microspheres hpmcp and rankl-secreting l lactis llrankl as a candidate oral vaccine in pregnant sows pregnant sows were vaccinated twice with a 2 week interval between doses at 4 weeks before farrowing titers of virus-specific iga antibodies in colostrum and neutralizing antibodies in serum of sows vaccinated with hpmcp ap2 plus ll rankl increased significantly at 4 weeks post-first vaccination furthermore the survival rate of newborn suckling piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with hpmcp ap2 plus ll rankl was similar to that of piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with a commercial killed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ped vaccine the south korean government promotes a ped vaccine program live-killed-killed to increase the titers of iga and igg antibodies in pregnant sows and prevent pedv the oral vaccine strategy described herein which is based on a safe and efficient recombinant subunit antigen is an alternative ped vaccination strategy that could replace the traditional strategy which relies on attenuated live oral vaccines or artificial infection with virulent pedv
infectious diseases due to microbes of high pathogenic potential remain a constant and variable threat for human and animal health the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of diseases that were previously under control complicates the situation to date infectious disease research which has undergone a dramatic progress in understanding disease mechanisms such as host-pathogen interactions is now focusing increasingly on new strategies for prevention and therapy significant progress has been achieved in the development of delivery systems for protective heterologous protein antigens and in veterinary vaccinology a landmark of infectious diseases research is the chemical synthesis of genomes a major new field of research referred to as ''synthetic biology'' that to date has resulted in the chemical synthesis of the poliovirus and of phage fx174 genomes and their expression as infectious viruses on the molecular level the evolution of pathogens and mechanisms of genome flexibility which account for several pathogenic properties of infectious agents have received increased attention bacterial toxins are an additional threat to human health and their interference with host cells and cellular functions is receiving more attention
the development of a safe and effective tetravalent dengue vaccine that elicits protection against all dengue virus denv serotypes is urgently needed the consensus sequence of the ectodomain of envelope e protein of denv ce80 has been examined as an immunogen previously in the current study a ce80 dna d vaccine was constructed and evaluated in conjunction with the ce80 protein p vaccine to examine whether both vaccines used together can further improve the immune responses the ce80 dna vaccine was administrated using either a homologous dna alone ddd or heterologous dna prime-protein boost ddp or dpp regimen and evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice among the three dna-based immunization regimens tested ddp immunization is the optimal immunization regimen that elicited the greatest systemic immune response and conferred protection against all four denv serotypes this work provides innovative ideas for the development of consensus e-based dengue vaccines and the testing of optimal immunization regimens
a retrospective immunohistochemical study was designed to investigate the frequency of concomitant traditional infectious disease pathogens in puppies that died suddenly and review the aspects of associated pathogenesis fifteen puppies were evaluated the pathology reports and histopathologic slides of these animals were reviewed to determine the pattern of histopathologic lesions the intralesional identification of antigens of canine distemper morbillivirus cdv canine adenovirus-1 and -2 cadv-1 and -2 canine parvovirus-2 cpv-2 toxoplasma gondii and neospora caninum was evaluated by ihc within the histopathologic patterns observed all puppies contained cdv nucleic acid by molecular testing the most frequent histopathologic patterns were intestinal crypt necrosis n = 8 white matter cerebellar demyelination n = 7 necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis n = 7 interstitial pneumonia n = 7 and gallbladder oedema n = 5 all puppies contained intralesional antigens of cdv in multiple tissues resulting in singular n = 3 and concomitant dual n = 3 triple n = 5 and quadruple n = 4 infections by cadv-1 and -2 cpv-2 and n caninum t gondii was not identified concomitant infections by cdv was observed with n caninum 100% 1/1 cpv-2 100% 8/8 cadv-1 100% 8/8 and cadv-2 100% 8/8 intralesional antigens of cdv and not cadv-1 were identified in cases of gallbladder oedema the "blue eye" phenomenon was histologically characterized by corneal oedema and degenerative lesions to the corneal epithelium without inflammatory reactions canine morbillivirus canine distemper virus cdv causes canine distemper cd in a wide range of mammalian hosts and may produce systemic respiratory cutaneous bone and/or neurological manifestations in these animals 12 . cdv produces immunosuppression 3 in susceptible hosts by targeting cells that express the signalling activation molecule slam 4 which frequently results in opportunistic infectious diseases caused by agents such as bordetella bronchiseptica 56 candida sp 7 clostridium piliforme 8 toxoplasma gondii 9-11 dirofilaria immitis 11 mycoplasma cynos 12 and talaromyces marneffei 13 . although the occurrence of cd is significantly reduced in domestic dog populations in developed countries due to the use of vaccination 14 the disease is endemic and a
objectives t follicular helper tfh cells are the principal t helper cell subset that provides help to b cells for potent antibody responses against various pathogens in this study we took advantage of the live-attenuated yellow fever virus yfv vaccine strain yf-17d as a model system for studying human antiviral immune responses in vivo following exposure to an acute primary virus challenge under safe and highly controlled conditions to comprehensively analyse the dynamics of circulating tfh ctfh cells methods we tracked and analysed the response of ctfh and other t and b cell subsets in peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by flow cytometry over the course of 4 weeks after yf-17d vaccination results using surface staining of cell activation markers to track yfv-specific t cells we found increasing ctfh cell frequencies starting at day 3 and peaking around 2 weeks after yf-17d vaccination this kinetic was confirmed in a subgroup of donors using mhc multimer staining for four known mhc class ii epitopes of yf-17d the subset composition of ctfh cells changed dynamically during the course of the immune response and was dominated by the ctfh1-polarised subpopulation importantly frequencies of ctfh1 cells correlated with the strength of the neutralising antibody response whereas frequencies of ctfh17 cells were inversely correlated conclusion in summary we describe detailed ctfh kinetics during yf-17d vaccination our results suggest that ctfh expansion and polarisation can serve as a ª prognostic marker for vaccine success these insights may be leveraged in the future to improve current vaccine design and strategies
the diagnostic performance of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv igg and iga elisas was evaluated using paired serum and meat juice samples collected from pedv-negative n = 50 and pedv-inoculated pigs n = 87 serum samples were tested by pedv igg iga elisas using a procedure performed routinely at the iowa state university-veterinary diagnostic laboratory isu-vdl serum samples were tested using pedv serum igg and iga elisa procedures as routinely performed at the iowa state university-veterinary diagnostic laboratory isu-vdl serum samples were diluted 150 and conjugate concentrations were 1/20000 for igg and 1/3000 for iga meat juice samples were tested using the serum pedv igg and iga elisas with modifications i e meat juice samples were diluted 125 and conjugate concentrations were 1/40000 for igg and 1/10000 for iga receiver operator characteristic roc curve analyses were used to estimate diagnostic sensitivities and specificities over a range of sample-to-positive s/p cutoffs consistent with previous reports this study showed that the pedv igg and iga meat juice elisas provided excellent diagnostic performance and suggest that meat juice recovered from samples collected at slaughter could be used in routine pedv surveillance
coccidiosis is caused by intra-cellular infection of eimeria spp which goes through a complex life cycle in the intestinal mucosa of infected hosts specific immunoglobulins igy could be produced in egg yolk by immunizing hens with specific antigens in the present study we cloned the e maxima gam56 gene expressed the gst-gam56 fusion protein and raised igy to gst-gam56 in hens the anti-gst-gam56 igy antibody was isolated and used to treat chickens infected with e maxima oocysts intramuscular injection of the antibodies provided minimal protection against parasite infection however oral dosing of the igy 3 or 5 d after oocyst inoculation significantly improved body weight gain reduced oocyst output and intestinal lesion score were reduced at 3 or 5 d after oocyst challenging compared to the untreated control group our findings suggest that the igy to gam56 could be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent against e maxima infection in chickens and should have a practical application value

many emerging infectious diseases in human populations are associated with zoonotic origins attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in or are transferred to human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption thus the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems the natural habitats and populations of wild animals and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species intensive food animal production systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries these systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover although not typically recognized as such industrial food animal production generates unique ecosystems-environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations it is often assumed that confined food animal production reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases this article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model moreover the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy in order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial food animal production private incentives for the implementation of biosecurity must align with public health interests
background as bats have recently been described to harbor many different viruses several studies have investigated the genetic co-variation between viruses and different bat species however little is known about the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species we hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses results we used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the natterer's bat myotis nattereri within and among populations at different geographical scales in germany further we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences 323-394 nt fragments of the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene obtained from the same bat populations our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled furthermore we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region moreover we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions conclusions the genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale nevertheless high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that occasional transmission across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur
background vaccination and passive antibody therapies are critical for controlling infectious diseases passive antibody administration has limitations including the necessity for purification and multiple injections for efficacy vaccination is associated with a lag phase before generation of immunity novel approaches reported here utilize the benefits of both methods for the rapid generation of effective immunity methods a novel antibody-based prophylaxis/therapy entailing the electroporation-mediated delivery of synthetic dna plasmids encoding biologically active anti-chikungunya virus chikv envelope monoclonal antibody dmab was designed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy as well as for the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination and passive immunotherapy results one intramuscular injection of dmab produced antibodies in vivo more rapidly than active vaccination with an anti-chikv dna vaccine this dmab neutralized diverse chikv clinical isolates and protected mice from viral challenge combination of dmab and the chikv dna vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection conclusions a dna-based dmab strategy induced rapid protection against an emerging viral infection this method can be combined with dna vaccination as a novel strategy to provide both short-and long-term protection against this emerging infectious disease these studies have implications for pathogen treatment and control strategies
the generation of tissue-resident memory t cells t rm is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces and it has been suggested that preferential generation of t rm is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines we have previously shown that antigenspecific il-17-producing cd4 + t cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae but whether pneumococcus-responsive t rm are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined here we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive il-17a-producing cd4 + mucosal t rm . furthermore we users may view print copy and download text and data-mine the content in such documents for the purposes of academic research subject always to the full conditions of useshow that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge unexpectedly and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective il-17a + cd4 + t rm in the nasal mucosa these results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of t rm in prevention of pneumococcal colonization and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination o'hara et al
salmonella species have been the major foodborne problems in food production systems with salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium s typhimurium and enteritidis s enteritidis being among the more common isolates the oral administration of chicken egg yolk specific antibodies igys has been established as an efficient alternative for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal pathogens including salmonella the present study was aimed to investigate the possible production of specific igys against salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks salmonella spp.-free female japanese quails coturnix coturnix japonica were intramuscularly immunized with formalin or heat-inactivated salmonella immunogens 1.0 × 10 9 cfu/ml emulsified with freund adjuvants egg yolk igys were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation method anti-salmonella igys titer and specificity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and western blot analysis salmonella specific igys detected in the immunized quails were significantly higher than those of the control group which confirmed the immunization procedure specific igys against s typhimurium and s enteritidis were identified in both groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens however formalin-inactivated immunogens induced relatively higher immune responses over the heat-inactivated ones quail anti-salmonella igys showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens with moderate crossreactivity to other members of enterobacteriaceae family quail can be regarded as a valuable and inexpensive source for producing large-scale of specific antibodies that can be used for immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes
background the development of a protective vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl is an alternative approach for interrupting the domestic cycle of leishmania infantum given the importance of sand fly salivary proteins as potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of leishmania parasites their inclusion in an anti-leishmania vaccine has been investigated in the last few decades in this context we previously immunized dogs with a vaccine composed of l braziliensis antigens plus saponin as the adjuvant and sand fly salivary gland extract lbsapsal vaccine this vaccine elicited an increase in both anti-saliva and anti-leishmania igg isotypes higher counts of specific circulating cd8 + t cells and high no production methods we investigated the immunogenicity and protective effect of lbsapsal vaccination after intradermal challenge with 1 × 10 7 late-log-phase l infantum promastigotes in the presence of sand fly saliva of lutzomyia longipalpis the dogs were followed for up to 885 days after challenge results the lbsapsal vaccine presents extensive antigenic diversity with persistent humoral and cellular immune responses indicating resistance against cvl is triggered by high levels of total igg and its subtypes igg1 and igg2 expansion of circulating cd5 + cd4 + and cd8 + t lymphocytes and is leishmania-specific and reduction of splenic parasite load conclusions these results encourage further study of vaccine strategies addressing leishmania antigens in combination with proteins present in the saliva of the vector
porcine rotavirus porv and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv usually co-infect pigs in modern large-scale piggery which both can cause severe diarrhea in newborn piglets and lead to significant economic losses to the pig industry the vp7 protein is the main coat protein of porv and the s protein is the main structural protein of pedv which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo in this study a dna vaccine ppi-2 egfp vp7 s co-expressing vp7 protein of porv and s protein of pedv was constructed six 8-week-old mice were immunized with the recombinant plasmid ppi-2 egfp vp7 s the high humoral immune responses virus specific antibody and cellular immune responses ifn-γ il-4 and spleen lymphocyte proliferation were evaluated the immune effect through intramuscular injection increased with plasmid dose when compared with subcutaneous injection the immune-enhancing effect of ifn-α adjuvant was excellent compared with pig spleen transfer factor and il-12 adjuvant these results demonstrated that ppi-2 egfp vp7 s possess the immunological functions of the vp7 proteins of porvand s proteins of pedv indicating that ppi-2 egfp vp7 s is a candidate vaccine for porcine rotaviral infection por and porcine epidemic diarrhea ped
background following the initial isolation of porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov from pigs with diarrheal disease in the united states in 2014 the virus has been detected on swine farms in some provinces of china to date little is known about the molecular epidemiology of pdcov in southern china where major swine production is operated results to investigate the prevalence of pdcov in this region and compare its activity to other enteric disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev and porcine rotavirus group c rota c 390 fecal samples were collected from swine of various ages from 15 swine farms with reported diarrhea fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr that targeted pdcov pedv tgev and rota c respectively pdcov was detected exclusively from nursing piglets with an overall prevalence of approximate 1.28 % 5/390 not in suckling and fattening piglets interestingly all of pdcov-positive samples were from 2015 rather than 2012-2014 despite a low detection rate pdcov emerged in each province/region of southern china in addition compared to tgev 1.54 % 5/390 or rota c 1.28 % 6/390 there were highly detection rates of pedv 22.6 % 88/390 in those samples notably all five pdcov-positive piglets were co-infected by pedv furthermore phylogenetic analysis of spike s and nucleocapsid n gene sequences of pdcovs revealed that currently circulating pdcovs in southern china were more closely related to other chinese strains of pdcovs than to those reported in united states south korea and thailand conclusions this study demonstrated that pdcov was present in southern china despite the low prevalence and supported an evolutionary theory of geographical clustering of pdcovs

the burden of vector-borne diseases dengue zika virus yellow fever etc gradually increased in the past decade across the globe mathematical modelling on infectious diseases helps to study the transmission dynamics of the pathogens theoretically the diseases can be controlled and eventually eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number r eff strictly less than 1 we established a vector-host compartmental model and derived r eff for vector-borne diseases the analytic form of the r eff was found to be the product of the basic reproduction number and the geometric average of the susceptibilities of the host and vector populations the r eff formula was demonstrated to be consistent with the estimates of the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in luanda and distinguished the second minor epidemic wave for those using the compartmental model to study the vector-borne infectious disease epidemics we further remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition ''from host to vector to host'' in reproduction number calculation

surveillance of rotavirus infections and circulating strains in small ruminants i e lambs goats and camelids has been a neglected research area in the past however recent years that have seen an intensification of surveillance in humans and livestock animals where vaccines to reduce disease burden caused by rotavirus a rva are available led to the efforts to better understand the epidemiology ecology and evolution of rva strains in other hosts including lambs goats and camelids the aim of this review is to provide an update of the epidemiology and strain diversity of rv strains in these species through searching for relevant information in public data bases
zoonoses are frequently reported and outbreaks of the highly pathogenic influenza virus severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome have occurred recently in africa the middle east and southeast asia sterilization using a chemical reactor with plasma assisted catalytic technology pact was investigated tests were carried out on the feline calicivirus fcv vaccine strain f9 which is a surrogate of airborne pathogen human norovirus results showed that the pact device could inactivate fcv which passed through the plasma chamber sterilization rate may be more than 99.99% below the detection limit these results indicate that pact may be an effective mean to inactivate many viruses including human norovirus and potentially other airborne infectious microorganisms
to study the antigenic structure of the peplomer protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus fragments from the peplomer gene were generated by restriction-enzyme cleavage or by limited dnase digestion and inserted in the escherichia coli expression plasmid pex stanley and luzio 1984 . the antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies the polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the il62-residue sequence the n-terminal region of one of the two subunits s2 was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies this clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes one of which has been localized within 18 residues the epitopes found as antigenic pex expression products do not coincide with the regions in the sl subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences we suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pex system the relevance of our findings for vaccine development is discussed
bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re-emerging viruses many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats the ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals towards a better understanding of the bat immune system we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable vh regions of antibodies from the black flying fox pteropus alecto the germline repertoire of the closely related pteropid bat pteropus vampyrus whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes representative vh genes were found in all three mammalian vh clans i ii and iii in both the expressed p alecto vh repertoire and the germline p vampyrus vh repertoire evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity dh and joining jh segments for the generation of diverse vdj rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of p alecto the long period of co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific vh segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens
barrier-bred cats were inoculated intracerebrally with either the rabbit-adapted borna disease virus bdv strain v or a newly isolated feline bdv obtained from a cat with natural staggering disease sd three out of eight inoculated cats developed neurological signs and non-suppurative encephalitis all three recovered from the acute stage of disease sero-conversion and the development of neutralizing antibodies occurred in all of the virus-inoculated cats in addition cats inoculated with feline bdv showed an early peripheral t cell response not present in cats inoculated with bdv strain v suggesting that the feline virus exerted a more vigorous effect on the immune system using immunohistochemistry and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay bdv-specific antigen and nucleic acid could be demonstrated in brain samples from each cat with encephalitis showing that incomplete viral clearance was probably responsible for the maintenance of inflammation the successful induction of neurological signs and encephalitis in one cat infected with feline bdv together with the detection of bdv-specific antigen and nucleic acid in the brain provides strong evidence for the notion that bdv is the etiological agent behind feline sd
background in 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally we aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated vero-cell sars vaccine in monkeys methods the cultures of sars coronavirus sars-cov bj-01 strain infected vero cells were inactivated with ␤-propiolactone sequential procedures including ultrafiltration gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography were performed to obtain purified inactivated sars vaccine the purified sars vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope hplc and western blotting we immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine respectively and a fourth group served as a control antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test the vaccinated monkeys were challenged with sars-cov bj-01 strain to observe protective efficacy additionally three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated sars vaccine 0.5 1 and 2 g/time/monkey on days 0 and 7 and the monkeys were challenged with sars-cov gz-01 strain we assessed the safety of the sars vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement ade occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus findings the purity of sars vaccine was 97.6% by hplc identification and reacted with convalescent sera of sars patients the purified sars vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of sars-cov in monkeys under low levels of neutralizing antibody no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with sars-cov in this preliminary animal trial no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified sars vaccine either at normal or large doses interpretation the purified inactivated sars vaccine could induce high levels of neutralizing antibody and protect the monkeys from the challenge of sars-cov the sars vaccine prepared in the study appeared to be safe in monkeys
although canine herpesvirus chv also referred to as canine herpesvirus 1 canid herpesvirus 1 neonatal herpes genital herpes ocular herpes and chv-1 infections and related diseases have been recognized since the early 1960s 1-5 there has been a resurgence of interest in the various clinical manifestations of the virus which makes this review very timely 6 -11 the various forms of chv-associated infections are listed in table 1 . in some cases these infections were directly related to clinical symptoms such as acute neonatal viremia resulting in puppy mortality systemic viremia in naive pregnant females resulting in fetal death abortion and mummification and ocular-respiratory disease in dogs of various age ranges 12 what has changed within the past decade has been the ability to detect the virus in its subclinical state which allows for a much clearer understanding of the importance of 2 subpopulations of dogs carrier-shedder adult dogs and chvlatently infected dogs in the animal populations with which we work 13-17 the increased sensitivity of both antibody-based serology assays and nucleic acidbased polymerase chain reaction pcr assays have increased our level of clinical inquiry regarding chv as well as the other canine infectious microorganisms 18 -22 in addition to recognizing chv adult carriers in the general population this new momentum has allowed for clinicians to screen dogs that are undergoingthe authors have nothing to disclose
viral infections remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients more recent developments in preparative regimens and graft manipulations as well as the control of well-recognized posttransplant infections by the introduction of prophylaxis and preemptive strategies have influenced the timing and the epidemiology of infections as new pathogens such as human metapneumovirus hmpv human bocavirus human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 human herpesviruses hhv-6 and hhv-7 and polyomaviruses have emerged it is fundamental to determine the significance of the newly discovered viruses and their role in the transplantation field this article summarizes recent data on epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of new pathogens as well as clinical features and management of the associated infectious complications
the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as sars coronavirus h5n1 h1n1 and recently h7n9 influenza viruses have been associated with significant mortality and morbidity in humans neutralizing antibodies from individuals who have recovered from an infection confer therapeutic protection to others infected with the same pathogen however survivors may not always be available for providing plasma or for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies mabs the genome and the immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques and humans are highly homologous therefore we investigated whether neutralizing mabs that are highly homologous to those of humans human-like could be generated using the h5n1 influenza virus as a model we first immunized rhesus macaques with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin ha following screening an antibody phage display library derived from the b cells of immunized monkeys we cloned selected macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions into the human igg constant region which generated human-macaque chimeric mabs exhibiting over 97% homology to human antibodies selected mabs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against three clades 0 1 2 of the h5n1 influenza viruses the in vivo protection experiments demonstrated that the mabs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with h5n1 influenza virus in particular mab 4e6 demonstrated sub-picomolar binding affinity to ha and superior in vivo protection efficacy without the loss of body weight and obvious lung damage the analysis of the 4e6 escape mutants demonstrated that the 4e6 antibody bound to a conserved epitope region containing two amino acids on the globular head of ha our study demonstrated the generation of neutralizing mabs for potential application in humans in urgent preparedness against outbreaks of new influenza infections or other virulent infectious diseases
most emerging human infectious diseases have an animal origin yet while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes either exclusively humans or exclusively animals without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks we propose a simple stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir e g humans by a zoonotic species considering two
vaccines consisting of transgenic plant-derived antigens offer a new strategy for development of safe inexpensive vaccines the vaccine antigens can be eaten with the edible part of the plant or purified from plant material in phase 1 clinical studies of prototype potato-and corn-based vaccines these vaccines have been safe and immunogenic without the need for a buffer or vehicle other than the plant cell transgenic plant technology is attractive for vaccine development because these vaccines are needle-less stable and easy to administer this chapter examines some early human studies of oral transgenic plantderived vaccines against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infection norovirus and hepatitis b
the spike s protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov is considered as a major antigen for vaccine design we previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain rbd residues 318-510 of s protein contains multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes conf i to vi and serves as a major target of sars-cov neutralization here we further characterized the antigenic structure in the rbd by a panel of novel mabs isolated from the mice immunized with an inactivated sars-cov vaccine ten of the rbd-specific mabs were mapped to four distinct groups of conformational epitopes designated group a to d and all of which had potent neutralizing activity against s protein-pseudotyped sars viruses group a b c mabs target the epitopes that may overlap with the previously characterized conf i iii and vi respectively but they display different capacity to block the receptor binding group d mab s25 was directed against a unique epitope by its competitive binding two anti-rbd mabs recognizing the linear epitopes group e were mapped to the rbd residues 335-352 and 442-458 respectively and none of them inhibited the receptor binding and virus entry surprisingly most neutralizing epitopes groups a to c could be completely disrupted by single amino acid substitutions e g d429a r441a or d454a or by deletions of several amino acids at the n-terminal or c-terminal region of the rbd however the group d epitope was not sensitive to the mutations highlighting its importance for vaccine development these data provide important information for understanding the antigenicity and immunogenicity of sars-cov and this panel of novel mabs can be used as tools for studying the structure of s protein and for guiding sars vaccine design y he voirs and its potential application as a bioterrorism agent the need to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov remains of high importance since the emergency of sars a number of candidate vaccines using a variety of approaches are under development . as a starting point inactivated sars-cov has been considered as one of the major vaccine candidates . several inactivated sars vaccines prepared by conventional protocols e g beta-propiolactone formaldehyde or uv light have been tested in preclinical studies . these killed whole virus vaccines are effective in terms of their capac-0264-410x/$ -see front matter

polioviruses with a g64s mutation in the 3d polymerase have enhanced replication fidelity and are attenuated in animal models here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3d polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 hev71 with mutations at positions 3d-s264l 3d-g64r or at 3d-s264l plus 3d-g64r mouse-adapted strains mp-g64r mp-s264l and mp-s264l-g64r were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3d polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus mp-26m mp-s264l and mp-s264l-g64r were attenuated in mice mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p i respectively compared to mp-g64r and mp-26m mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p i respectively mp-26m and mp-g64r infection induced early onset severe generalised necrotising myositis whereas mp-s264l and mp-s264l-g64r infection induced a later onset mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis our findings demonstrate that only the 3d-s264l mutation attenuates hev71 in mice suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model
two species of primates owl and african green monkeys were inoculated intracerebrally with either the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus jhm or the putative multiple sclerosis brain coronavirus isolate sd . these viruses caused an acute to subacute panencephalitis and/or demyelination in the infected animals . the course of pathogenesis and sites of detected viral rna and antigen was dependent both on animal species and virus strain but the results clearly showed that these viruses replicated and disseminated in the central nervous system cns of these primates . this study suggests that human cns maybe susceptible to coronavirus infection . 4

with an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains new strategies are required to 8 prepare for the next emergent coronavirus cov previously groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future covs with this in mind we explored whether manipulation of cov nsp16 a 11 conserved 2'o methyltransferase mtase could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains using the sars-cov mouse model a nsp16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge efficacy in the aging host and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis despite some success concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting nsp16 alone an untenable approach however 16 combining a 2'o mtase mutation with a previously described cov fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge efficacy in aged mice 18 and no evidence for reversion together the results indicate that targeting the cov 2'o mtase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.21 significance 22 emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response 23 vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks however failure of many previous cov 24 vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions 25 and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised this study 26illustrates that despite success in young models the nsp16 mutant carries too much risk for 27 pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy importantly the nsp16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide 29 robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations coupled with 30 increased safety and reduced pathogenesis the study highlights the potential for nsp16 31 attenuation as a major component of future live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines
astroviruses were detected by electron microscopy in the feces from a 4 month old kitten with diarrhea the mean diameter of the viral particles was 28.7 nm and they showed characteristic five-or six-pointed star-shaped surface configurations the clinical disease manifested by the cat and the observed morphology of the viral particles are consistent with previous reports on astroviruses of other species .viral gastroenteritis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in neonatal and young animals birds and man throughout the world 2 3 5 17 19 . the development of methods for identification of viruses in fecal samples by direct electron microscopy em has led to the discovery of a number of previously unrecognized enteric viruses including astroviruses astroviruses are isometric approximately 28 nm in diameter viral particles which when negatively stained give the impression of a white five-or six-pointed star superimposed on the particle astroviruses have been detected in the feces of humans 1 8 9 12 t3 15 18 calves 23 lambs 20 and turkeys 16 with diarrhea since attempts to propagate the mammalian and avian astroviruses in cell cultures have been unsuccessful their size and morphology as determined by em are the primary criteria by which they are identified viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescent staining within the cytoplasm of cultured cells infected with fecal material of human 10 11 and bovine 23 astroviruses however these infections were abortive in
live recombinant bacteria represent attractive antigen delivery systems able to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses against heterologous antigens the first live recombinant bacterial vectors developed were derived from attenuated pathogenic microorganisms in addition to the difficulties often encountered in the construction of stable attenuated mutants of pathogenic organisms attenuated pathogens may retain a residual virulence level that renders them unsuitable for the vaccination of partially immunocompetent individuals such as infants the elderly or immunocompromised patients as an alternative to this strategy non-pathogenic food-grade lactic acid bacteria lab maybe used as live antigen carriers this article reviews lab vaccines constructed using antigens other than tetanus toxin fragment c against bacterial viral and parasitic infective agents for which protection studies have been performed the antigens utilized for the development of lab vaccines are briefly described along with the efficiency of these systems in protection studies moreover the key factors affecting the performance of these systems are highlighted
a major limitation of current humanized mouse models is that they primarily enable the analysis of human-specific pathogens that infect hematopoietic cells however most human pathogens target other cell types including epithelial endothelial and mesenchymal cells here we show that implantation of human lung tissue which contains up to 40 cell types including nonhematopoietic cells into immunodeficient mice lung-only mice resulted in the development of a highly vascularized lung implant we demonstrate that emerging and clinically relevant human pathogens such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus zika virus respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus replicate in vivo in these lung implants when incorporated into bone marrow/liver/thymus humanized mice lung implants are repopulated with autologous human hematopoietic cells we show robust antigen-specific humoral and t-cell responses following cytomegalovirus infection that control virus replication lung-only mice and bone marrow/liver/thymus-lung humanized mice substantially increase the number of human pathogens that can be studied in vivo facilitating the in vivo testing of therapeutics
given the highly contagious and acute nature of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped especially in piglets there is an urgent need for the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays the diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv accessory and nonstructural proteins if any have not yet been investigated in order to determine and compare which of the viral proteins may be useful as diagnostic antigens whole virus wv particles and a panel of structural and nonstructural pedv proteins were tested for reactivity with sera from pedv-infected pigs by elisa and/or western blot analysis according to western blots serum antibody interactions with the s1 protein were relatively more sensitive and specific than orf3c e and ac furthermore a total of 851 serum samples from diarrheal pigs of different ages were analyzed by elisa with most showing immune-reactivity towards the wv s1 orf3c and e proteins the earliest igg antibody response was observed in the one-week-old piglets with similar antibody ontogeny and patterns of seroconversion for s1 orf3c e and wv antigens in addition the pattern of neutralizing antibody was more similar to that of iga in weaning piglets after pedv infection collectively these data provide more reliable information on the host immune response to different viral proteins which will be useful for development of novel serological assays and for design of vaccines that better stimulate protective immunity
streptococcus mutans is a common principal causative agent of dental caries in this communication we describe that the antibodies raised against purified dextransucrase effectively inhibited the growth of s mutans the purified enzyme showed 58-fold enrichment 17.5% yield and a specific activity of 3.96 units/mg protein purified igg fraction of the antibody showed significant affinity with the antigenic protein immunotritation of the enzyme with dextransucrase antibody showed a gradual increase in inhibition of dextransucrase activity the growth of s mutans was also inhibited by 85% in the presence of 28 μg of igg fraction of the antibody antibodies also impaired glucosyltransferase activity 72.8% and biofilm formation by 92.6% in s mutans western blot analysis revealed no cross reactivity with the various tissues of mice rat rabbit and humans dot blot analysis showed little reactivity with lactobacillus acidophilus and staphylococcus aureus and there was no reactivity with other bacterial strains like enterococcus faecalis escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium these findings suggest that antibody raised against dextransucrase exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of s mutans and biofilm formation with no reactivity with various mammalian tissues thus it could be an effective anticariogenic agent
vaccine development has had a huge impact on human health however there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential this review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1 the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines and 2 the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation nanoparticle-based vaccines including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development these include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells enable cross-protection against divergent strains act as adjuvants or immunomodulators allow for sustained release of antigen enable single dose delivery and potentially obviate the cold chain while mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic an overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections with advantages and disadvantages of each model is discussed taken together advances in nanotechnology combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections
infectious diseases that do not primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract can cause severe diarrhea the pathogenesis of this kind of diarrhea includes cytokine action intestinal inflammation sequestration of red blood cells apoptosis and increased permeability of endothelial cells in the gut microvasculature and direct invasion of gut epithelial cells by various infectious agents of the travel-associated systemic infections presenting with fever diarrhea occurs in patients with malaria dengue fever and sars diarrhea also occurs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia when it is suggestive of legionellosis diarrhea can also occur in patients with systemic bacterial infections in addition although diarrhea is rare in patients with early lyme borreliosis the incidence is higher in those with other tick-borne infections such as ehrlichiosis tickborne relapsing fever and rocky mountain spotted fever unfortunately it is often not established whether diarrhea is an initial symptom or develops during the course of the disease the real incidence of diarrhea in some infectious diseases must also be questioned because it could represent an adverse reaction to antibiotics
in the last few decades the chikungunya virus chikv has evolved from a geographically isolated pathogen to a virus that is widespread in many parts of africa asia and recently also in central-and south-america although chikv infections are rarely fatal the disease can evolve into a chronic stage which is characterized by persisting polyarthralgia and joint stiffness this chronic chikv infection can severely incapacitate patients for weeks up to several years after the initial infection despite the burden of chikv infections no vaccine or antivirals are available yet the current therapy is therefore only symptomatic and consists of the administration of analgesics antipyretics and anti-infl ammatory agents recently several molecules with various viral or host targets have been identifi ed as chikv inhibitors in this chapter we summarize the current status of the development of antiviral strategies against chikv infections
a loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay was developed specifically for detection and differentiation of pseudorabies virus prv one group of primers was designed to detect wild-type strains i e strains with the ge gene and the other group of primers was designed to detect both prv ge-vaccine and wild-type strains i e strains with the gg gene and with or without the ge gene after amplification by bst enzyme at a constant temperature of 65 • c a laddering of bright products was visible following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel lamp was 100-1000-fold more sensitive than the standard pcr the assay was specific in that it did not amplify other porcine viruses including porcine parvovirus porcine circovirus type 1 porcine circovirus type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus classical swine fever virus swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus because of its sensitivity specificity and simplicity the lamp assay could be a useful method for early and rapid differentiation of swine vaccinated with prv ge-deleted vaccine from swine infected with wild virus
recombinant subvirual particles retain similar antigenic features of their authentic viral capsids and thus have been applied as nonreplicating subunit vaccines against viral infection and illness additionally the self-assembled polyvalent subviral particles are excellent platforms to display foreign antigens for immune enhancement for vaccine development these subviral particle-based vaccines are noninfectious and thus safer than the conventional live attenuated and inactivated vaccines while several vlp vaccines are available in the markets numerous others including dual vaccines against more than one pathogen are under clinical or preclinical development this article provides an update of these efforts

many viral diseases are endemic in cattle populations worldwide the ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood there is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows which are reflected in reduced conception rates these effects are however highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify this paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility together with their potential mechanisms of action acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves bvdv infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality fertility may also be reduced by bvdv-induced immunosuppression which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections bovine herpesvirus bhv-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers and can slow their growth delay breeding and increase the age at first calving previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility although this may be associated with lung damage ovarian lesions have also been reported both bhv-1 and bhv-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress for example associated with calving and early lactation while bhv-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli and trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving both schmallenberg virus sbv and bluetongue virus btv are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations btv-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts furthermore infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes

recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is widely used as a vaccine platform however the capacity of vsv-based vaccines to induce mucosal immunity has not been fully investigated in the present study a recombinant vsv expressing coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 major immunogen vp1 has been generated and the immune protection elicited by vsv-vp1 was evaluated we demonstrated that intranasal delivery of vsv-vp1 can induce a potent antigen-specific mucosal immune response as well as a systemic immune response particularly the induction of polyfunctional t cells importantly mice immunized with vsv-vp1 were better protected against cvb3-induced viral myocarditis than those receiving a chitosan-formulated dna vaccine increased dendritic cell dc maturation in the mesenteric lymph node mln was observed in the mice vaccinated with vsv-vp1 which could be a potential mechanism for the protective immune response these findings support vsv as a viral delivery vector that can induce robust mucosal immunity that should be considered for further vaccine development
the covid-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic responsible for over 2000000 confirmed cases and over 126000 deaths worldwide in this study we examined the immunogenicity of cho-expressed recombinant sars-cov-2 s1-fc fusion protein in mice rabbits and monkeys as a potential candidate for a covid-19 vaccine we demonstrate that the s1-fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7 strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the s1-fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay most importantly in less than 20 days and three injections of the s1-fc fusion protein two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered covid-19 patient in a live sars-cov-2 infection assay our data strongly suggests that the cho-expressed sars-cov-2 s1-fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against covid-19.-8 -highlightscan rapidly induce strong antibody production 2 s1-fc protein solicits strong neutralizing activities against live virus 3 stable cho cell line expressing 50 mg/l of s1-fc and a 3000 l bioreactor can produce 3 million doses of human covid-19 vaccine every 10 days making it an accessible and affordable option for worldwide vaccination
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a coronavirus which causes severe diarrhea and fatal dehydration in piglets in general probiotic supplements could enhance recovery and protect piglets against enteric pathogens seven local lactic acid bacteria lab ent faecium 79n and 40n lact plantarum 22f 25f and 31f ped acidilactici 72n and ped pentosaceus 77f from pig feces were well-characterized as high potential probiotics cell-free supernatants cfs and live lab were evaluated for antiviral activities by coincubation on vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of pedv isolated from pigs in thailand cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect cpe reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence at 116 cfs dilution ph 6.3-6.8 showed no cytotoxicity in vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays the diluted cfs of all lact plantarum showed the antiviral effect against pedv however the same antiviral effect could not be observed in ent faecium and pediococcus strains in competitive experiment only live lact plantarum 25f and ped pentosaceus 77f showed cpe reduction in the viral infected cells to <50% observed field area this study concluded that the cfs of all tested lactobacilli and live lact plantarum 22f and 25f and pediococcus strains 72n and 77f could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of pedv from pigs in thailand on the target vero cells
avian paramyxovirus apmv serotypes 1-9 have been isolated from many different avian species apmv-1 newcastle disease virus is the only well-characterized serotype because of the high morbidity mortality and economic loss caused by highly virulent strains very little is known about the pathogenesis replication virulence and tropism of the other apmv serotypes here this was evaluated for prototypes strains of apmv serotypes 2-9 in cell culture and in chickens and ducks in cell culture only apmv-1 -3 and -5 induced syncytium formation in chicken df1 cells apmv-3 replicated with an efficiency approaching that of apmv-1 while apmv-2 and -5 replicated to lower intermediate titers and the others were much lower mean death time mdt assay in chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index icpi test in 1-day-old spf chicks demonstrated that apmv types 2-9 were avirulent evaluation of replication in primary neuronal cells in vitro as well as in the brains of 1-day-old chicks showed that among types 2-9 only apmv-3 was neurotropic although this virus was not neurovirulent following intranasal infection of 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens replication of apmv types 2-9 was mostly restricted to the respiratory tract although apmv-3 was neuroinvasive and neurotropic but not neurovirulent and also was found in the spleen experimental intranasal infection of 3-week-old mallard ducks with the apmvs did not produce any clinical signs even for apmv-1 and exhibited restricted viral replication of the apmvs including apmv-1 to the upper respiratory tract regardless of their isolation source indicating avirulence of apmv types 1-9 in mallard ducks the link between the presence of a furin cleavage site in the f protein syncytium formation systemic spread and virulence that has been well-established with apmv-1 pathotypes was not evident with the other apmv serotypes
recently there has been a steady increase in the number of recognized pathogenic microorganisms specifically bacteria the development of genetic technologies maldi-tof mass spectrometry and new culturing techniques has significantly widened the repertoire of known microorganisms and therefore pathogenic microorganisms the repertoire of infectious agents has been studied in various environments including water soil pets livestock wildlife and arthropods using different methods many known pathogens can be identified in these samples therefore the impact of emergent pathogens on humans can be examined and novel pathogens can be identified in this special issue we discuss the identification of emerging pathogens in the environment and animals
newcastle disease virus ndv and goose parvovirus gpv are considered to be two of the most important and widespread viruses infecting geese in this study we generated a recombinant rmna-vp3 expressing gpv vp3 using a modified goose-origin ndv na-1 by changing the multi-basic cleavage site motif rrqkr↓f of the f protein to the dibasic motif grqgr↓l as that of the avirulent strain lasota as a vaccine vector expression of the vp3 protein in rmna-vp3 infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot assay the genetic stability was examined by serially passaging 10 times in 10-day-old embryonated spf chicken eggs goslings were inoculated with rmna-vp3 showed no apparent signs of disease and developed a strong gpv and ndv neutralizing antibodies response this is the first study demonstrating that recombinant ndv has the potential to serve as bivalent live vaccine against goose parvovirus and newcastle disease virus infection in birds
the coronavirus family member sars-cov-2 has been identified as the causal agent for the pandemic viral pneumonia disease covid-19 at this time no vaccine is available to control further dissemination of the disease we have previously engineered a synthetic dna vaccine targeting the mers coronavirus spike s protein the major surface antigen of coronaviruses which is currently in clinical study here we build on this prior experience to generate a synthetic dna-based vaccine candidate targeting sars-cov-2 s protein the engineered construct ino-4800 results in robust expression of the s protein in vitro following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with ino-4800 we measure antigen-specific t cell responses functional antibodies which neutralize the sars-cov-2 infection and block spike protein binding to the ace2 receptor and biodistribution of sars-cov-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs this preliminary dataset identifies ino-4800 as a potential covid-19 vaccine candidate supporting further translational study
influenza causes seasonal outbreaks yearly and unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates despite significant efforts to address influenza it remains a major threat to human public health this issue is partially due to the lack of antiviral drugs with potent antiviral activity and broad reactivity against all influenza virus strains and the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants moreover designing a universal influenza vaccine that is sufficiently immunogenic to induce universal antibodies is difficult some novel epitopes hidden in the hemagglutinin ha trimeric interface have been discovered recently and a number of antibodies targeting these epitopes have been found to be capable of neutralizing a broad range of influenza isolates these findings may have important implications for the development of universal influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs in this review we focused on the antibodies targeting these newly discovered epitopes in the ha domain of the influenza virus to promote the development of universal anti-influenza antibodies or vaccines and extend the discovery to other viruses with similar conformational changes in envelope proteins
acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic pathogens in clinical settings emerging of its antibiotic-resistant strains persuade researchers to find alternative treatment options such as immunization against the notorious nosocomial pathogen oma87 has been introduced as an immunogenic outer membrane protein via reverse vaccinology however protectivity of a baumannii oma87 is not well known the current research undertakes a study on the immunogenicity of recombinant oma87 in a murine model some physico-chemical properties were assessed via in silico analyses the corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into pet28a plasmid the recombinant protein was purified and then was administered to immunize mice sera obtained from the immunized mice were assessed with respect to the triggered antibodies challenges were performed on actively or passively immunized mice in silico analyses revealed that this protein is the same as bama a high titer of specific antibody was raised against roma87 even after the first injection the specific antibody recognized the whole cell of a baumannii both active and passive immunizations confer 100 and 50% protection respectively against ~ 2 × lethal dose ld of a baumannii in the murine sepsis model although none of mice received ~ 5 × ld of a baumannii survived in passive immunization 25% of mice challenged with ~ 7 × ld of the bacteria survived and the dead mice exhibited a delayed death based on these results oma87 is the same as bama which could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate against a baumannii in the sepsis model
the following six methods for detecting rotavirus in human faecal samples were compared electron microscopy immune electron microscopy immunofluoreseence in cell culture two enzyme immunoassays rotazyme enzygnost and a latex agglutination test rotalex specimens were collected from 112 children with diarrhoea the relative sensitivities of the different assays for human rotavirus were as follows electron microscopy 84% immunofluorescence 86 % rotalex 88 % rotazyme 89 % immune electron microscopy 93 % enzygnost 98 %. according to our findings enzygnost is the most sensitive method but rotalex is more valuable for screening a small number of faecal samples no false-positive results were observed in the two enzyme immunoassays or in rotalex
infections with geographically constrained dimorphic fungi cause the endemic mycoses which include blastomycosis coccidioidomycosis emmonsiosis histoplasmosis paracoccidioidomycosis sporotrichosis and penicilliosis in the last 5 years our understanding of the epidemiology diagnostics and to a lesser extent management of these diseases has advanced specifically the application of molecular techniques for genotyping fungal pathogens has resulted in the recognition of cryptic species within several genera including blastomyces and paracoccidioides the reclassification of penicillium marneffei the agent of penicilliosis to the genus talaromyces and the global emergence of dimorphic fungi of the genus emmonsia cause disease in immunocompromised persons new and refined diagnostic tests are available based on the detection of circulating antigens and antibodies mass spectrometry and targeted gene amplification in contrast the development of new therapeutic options remains stalled although isavuconazole may hold promise finally advances have been made in the prospect of viable vaccines for preventing animal and human disease
respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality as well as concern about pandemic spread examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and novel variants of influenza a virus such as h5n1 and pandemic h1n1 different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses but it is not clear which are most suitable therefore this review compares animal models of sars and influenza with an emphasis on nonhuman primates ferrets and cats firstly the pathology and pathogenesis of sars and influenza are compared both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in sars and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in h5n1 influenza secondly the pathology and pathogenesis of sars and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared host species host age route of inoculation location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease the design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome
epitope-based dna vaccines designed to induce t cell responses specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis m tb are being developed as a means of addressing vaccine potency in this study we predicted 4 t cell epitopes from esat-6 ag85a/b and cfp-10 antigens and constructed an ecans epitopes casted in a natural structure dna vaccine by inserting the epitope dna segments separately into the gene backbone of m tb-derived hsp65 heat shock protein 65 carrier the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of pecans dna vaccine were assessed in balb/c mice after intramuscular immunization with 4 doses of 50 g ecans dna and followed by mycobaterial challenge 4 weeks after the last immunization compared to plasmid encoding hsp65 pecans dna immunization elicited remarkably higher levels of ifn-␥ production by both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells which were coupled with higher frequencies of antigen-specific t cells and higher ctl activity significantly enhanced levels of th1 cytokines ifn-␥ and il-12 and increased serum igg2a/igg1 ratio were also noted indicating a predominant th1 immune response achieved by pecans dna immunization in the consequence a better protection against mycobacterium bovis bcg challenge was achieved which was evidenced by reduced bacterial loads in lungs and spleens and profound attenuation of lung inflammation and injury our results suggested that multi-t cell-epitope based ecans gene vaccine induced t cell response to multiple t cell epitopes and led to enhanced protection against mycobacterial challenge this strategy might be a useful platform to design multi-t cell epitope-based vaccine against m tb infection
the first reported outbreak of ebola virus disease occurred in 1976 in yambuku democratic republic of congo antibody responses in survivors 11 years after infection have been documented however this report is the first characterization of anti-ebola virus antibody persistence and neutralization capacity 40 years after infection using elisas we measured survivor's immunological response to ebola virus zaire ebov glycoprotein and nucleoprotein and assessed vp40 reactivity neutralization of ebov was measured using a pseudovirus approach and plaque reduction neutralization test with live ebov some survivors from the original ebov outbreak still harbor antibodies against all 3 measures interestingly a subset of these survivors' serum antibodies could still neutralize live virus 40 years postinitial infection these data provide the longest documentation of both anti-ebola serological response and neutralization capacity within any survivor cohort extending the known duration of response from 11 years postinfection to at least 40 years after symptomatic infection
the various infectious diseases that affect the liver primarily or as a part of systemic infection although bacterial infections are probably the most common cause of infectious hepatitis the clinician should be aware of other potential organisms and other commonly involved systems therefore this article includes a description of common bacterial mycobacterial viral fungal protozoal parasitic and rickettsial diseases in dogs and cats
escherichia coli was first recognized as a cause of diarrhea and septicemia in calves more than 115 years ago 1 intestinal infection with e coli manifested principally by diarrhea is commonly known as enteric colibacillosis in contrast to septicemic and enterotoxemic colibacillosis which are characterized by systemic infection and peracute collapse 23 diarrheagenic e coli are now broadly placed into 6 classes based on virulence mechanisms 45 one of these classes enterotoxigenic e coli etec is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life 36 etec are characterized principally by the production of fimbriae and enterotoxins with strains producing k99 now called f5 fimbria and heat-stable enterotoxin-a sta as the main ones causing disease in calves 3-6 two other diarrheagenic classes namely enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec and enteropathogenic e coli epec are important causes of disease in human beings but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves e coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis hc and hemolytic uremic syndrome hus in humans express high levels of shiga toxin stx cause attaching-effacing a/e lesions in intestinal epithelial cells and possess a specific 60-mda ehec plasmid are known as ehec 7 hence using this original definition the causation of human illness hc or hus was an obligatory criterion for identification of an isolate as ehec 7 one feature ehec and epec have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing a/e 4 5 8 attaching-effacing e coli aeec is a designation for those e coli strains known to cause a/e lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait and therefore include organisms that fall into either the ehec or epec classes 4 5 8 a distinction between ehec and epec is that the former produce stx whereas the latter do not 45 e coli strains that produce or carry genes for the production of stx also known as verotoxin or verocytotoxin and formerly
bovine herpesvirus-1 bhv-1 is a major cause of respiratory tract diseases in cattle vaccination of cattle against bhv-1 is a high priority a major concern of currently modified live bhv-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection and subsequent reactivation resulting in many outbreaks thus there is a need for alternative strategies we generated two recombinant newcastle disease viruses ndvs expressing the glycoprotein d gd of bhv-1 from an added gene one recombinant rlasota/gdfl expressed gd without any modification the other recombinant rlasota/gdf expressed a chimeric gd in which the ectodomain of gd was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the ndv fusion f glycoprotein remarkably the native gd expressed by rlasota/gdfl virus was incorporated into the ndv virion 2.5-fold more efficiently than the native ndv proteins whereas the chimeric gd was not detectably incorporated even though it was abundantly expressed on the infected cell surface the expression of gd did not increase the virulence of the rndv vectors in chickens a single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with either recombinant ndv elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to bhv-1 with the responses to rlasota/gdfl being higher than those to rlasota/gdf following challenge with bhv-1 calves immunized with the recombinant ndvs had lower titers and earlier clearance of challenge virus compared to the empty vector control and reduced disease was observed with rlasota/gdfl following challenge the titers of serum antibodies specific to bhv-1 were higher in the animals immunized with the rndv vaccines compared to the rndv parent virus indicating that the vaccines primed for secondary responses our data suggest that ndv can be used as a vaccine vector in bovines and that bhv-1 gd may be useful in mucosal vaccine against bhv-1 infection but might require augmentation by a second dose or the inclusion of additional bhv-1 antigens
an effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars will probably require the generation and maintenance of both humoral and cellular immune responses it has been reported that after natural infection in humans and immunization in animals with sars-cov vaccine antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time in the present study mice were immunized i m with sars-cov s dna vaccine and three different methods elisa elispot and facs were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptides overlapping entire sars spike protein the results show that prime-immunization with sars-cov s dna vaccine can induce both cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses boosting with the same vaccine enhances cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs and were persistent over two months the sars-cov s-specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cells were cd62l − a marker for memory cells and −30 to 50% of the cells expressed il-7r␣ cd127 a marker for the capacity of effector cells to develop into memory cells in addition immunization with the dna vaccine elicited high levels of antibody production taken together these data demonstrate that immunization with sars-cov s dna vaccine can generate antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses that may contribute to long-term protection
a total of 239 pig tissue samples from 91 farms were tested by nested rt-pcr among 239 samples 22 samples from 17 farms were positive for phev the detection rate of suckling pigs weaning pigs growers and finishers were 14.3% 12/84 6.5% 7/107 7% 3/43 and 0% 0/5 respectively symptoms were neurological respiratory enteric sign diarrhea or nasal bleeding all pigs were co-infected with other viruses and bacteria and this might have resulted in age variation and clinical signs in the affected pigs phylogenetic analysis showed that the phev-positive samples and phev reference strains were clustered in the same group these findings imply the presence of only one genogroup of phev regardless of porcine age clinical signs and geographical location
diarrhoea is a common and multi-factorial condition in dogs the aetiology of which is often incompletely understood a case-control study was carried out to compare the carriage of some common canine enteric pathogens enteric coronavirus parvovirus distemper endoparasites campylobacter and salmonella spp as well as lifestyle factors such as vaccination history diet and contact with other species in dogs presenting at first opinion veterinary practices with and without diarrhoea multivariable conditional logistic regression showed that dogs in the study which scavenged or had had a recent change of diet or 3.5 p = 0.002 had recently stayed in kennels or 9.5 p = 0.01 or were fed a home-cooked diet or 4 p = 0.002 were at a significantly greater risk of diarrhoea whilst being female or 0.4 p = 0.01 currently up to date with routine vaccinations or 0.4 p = 0.05 and having contact with horse faeces or 0.4 p = 0.06 were associated with a reduced risk none of the pathogens tested for was a significant factor in the final multivariable model suggesting that in this predominantly vaccinated population diarrhoea may be more associated with lifestyle risk factors than specific pathogens
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an important pathogen that has a significant economic impact on the swine industry by imposing a high rate of mortality in suckling piglets however limited information on the productivity values of gilts and sows infected with pedv is available here we evaluate the productivity index in gilts and sows during the 1year period before 19
reasons for performing study diarrhoea caused by infectious agents is common in foals but there is no comprehensive molecular work-up of the relative prevalence of common agents and appearance of coinfections objectives to determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal gi-diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of gi disease study design retrospective controlled observational study methods the population consisted of 88 thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in kentucky healthy n = 37 and gi-diseased n = 51 foals were identified based on clinical presentation faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real-time pcr equine rotavirus equine coronavirus clostridium difficile toxins a & b neorickettsia risticii clostridium perfringens alpha toxin lawsonia intracellularis rhodococcus equi cryptosporidium spp and salmonella spp salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth results the prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% lawsonia intracellularis and 34.6% equine rotavirus the overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the gi-diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group 15 monoinfections vs 22 coinfections than in the healthy group 12 vs 4 respectively p = 0.0002 six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the gi-diseased group the other 2 were not equine coronavirus and r equi conclusions the use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation
phlebotomus orientalis is a vector of leishmania donovani the causative agent of life threatening visceral leishmaniasis spread in eastern africa during blood-feeding sand fly females salivate into the skin of the host sand fly saliva contains a large variety of proteins some of which elicit specific antibody responses in the bitten hosts to evaluate the exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease endemic areas we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers' sera against recombinant p orientalis salivary antigens recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on p orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced using either bacterial five proteins or mammalian four proteins expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-p orientalis igg in human sera using these recombinant proteins human sera from sudan and ethiopia countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis were screened by elisa and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to p orientalis bites two recombinant proteins mag5 and myel1 were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of p orientalis exposure
wild ducks are the main reservoir of influenza a viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry and mammals including humans of the 16 hemagglutinin ha subtypes of influenza a viruses only the h5 and h7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic hp influenza in the natural hosts several duck species are naturally resistant to hp asian h5n1 influenza viruses these duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs while the hp asian h5n1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the ''trojan horses'' of h5n1 in their surreptitious spread of virus an important unresolved issue is whether the hp h5n1 viruses are maintained in the wild duck population of the world here we review the ecology and pathobiology of ducks infected with influenza a viruses and ducks' role in the maintenance and spread of hp h5n1 viruses we also identify the key questions about the role of ducks that must be resolved in order to understand the emergence and control of pandemic influenza it is generally accepted that wild duck species can spread hp h5n1 viruses but there is insufficient evidence to show that ducks maintain these viruses and transfer them from one generation to the next
fever which is closely linked to viraemia is considered to be both the main and the earliest clinical sign in sheep infected with bluetongue virus btv the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of infrared thermography irt for early detection of fever in sheep experimentally infected with bluetongue virus serotype 1 btv-1 and serotype 8 btv-8 this would reduce animal stress during experimental assays and assist in the development of a screening method for the identification of fever in animals suspected of being infected with btv rectal and infrared eye temperatures were collected before and after btv inoculation the two temperature measures were positively correlated r = 0.504 p < 0.05 the highest correlation between rectal and infrared temperatures was observed when temperatures were above physiological levels irt discriminated between febrile and non-febrile sheep with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. the results showed that eye temperature measured using irt was a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of fever in sheep infected with btv under experimental conditions further research is required to evaluate the use of irt under field conditions to identify potentially infected animals in bluetongue surveillance programmes
base on the sequence of s genes which encode spike proteins we previously identified three different types north american s indel and s large-del types of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv that have re-emerged in japan since 2013 based on experimental infections with the north american and s large-del types we also hypothesized that pedv virulence may be linked to the s1 subunit of the s protein to test this hypothesis we have now assayed in gnotobiotic piglets various recombinant pedvs generated by reverse genetics piglets inoculated with cv777 maintained in national institute of animal health along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus developed subclinical to mild diarrhea in contrast severe watery diarrhea dehydration weight loss astasia and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the s gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent japanese pedv isolate okn-1/jpn/2013 indeed symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the okn-1/jpn/2013 and were especially pronounced in younger piglets collectively the data demonstrate that the s1 subunit of the s protein is an important determinant of pedv virulence and advance development of new vaccine candidate
astroviruses astvs have been identified in the stools of calves with enteritis and in the brain tissues of bovines with encephalitis but their pathogenic role has not been clarified in this study we report the detection and characterization of bovine and water buffalo astv strains identified in young bovine and buffalo calves with enteritis in italy between 2012 and 2015 by negative staining transmission electron microscopy tem observation astv-like particles were identified in the stools of the animals and astv rna was confirmed molecularly the sequence ~3.2-kb at the 3′ end of the genome was determined for two bovine and two buffalo astvs sequence and phylogenetic analysis on the partial orf1b and full-length orf2 revealed a marked genetic diversity although the viruses were distantly related to other astv identified from ruminants gathering sequence information on ruminant astvs is important to understand the extent of inter-species circulation and for the development of reliable specific diagnostic tools

rodents and bats are now widely recognised as important sources of zoonotic virus infections in other mammals including humans numerous surveys have expanded our knowledge of diverse viruses in a range of rodent and bat species including their origins evolution and range of hosts in this study of pegivirus and human hepatitis-related viruses liver and serum samples from vietnamese rodents and bats were examined by pcr and sequencing nucleic acids homologous to human hepatitis b c e viruses were detected in liver samples of 2 1.3% of 157 bats 38 8.1% and 14 3% of 470 rodents respectively hepacivirus-like viruses were frequently detected 42.7% in the bamboo rat rhizomys pruinosus while pegivirus rna was only evident in 2 0.3% of 638 rodent serum samples complete or near-complete genome sequences of hbv hev and pegivirus homologues closely resembled those previously reported from rodents and bats however complete coding region sequences of the rodent hepacivirus-like viruses substantially diverged from all of the currently classified variants and potentially represent a new species in the hepacivirus genus of the viruses identified their routes of transmission and potential to establish zoonoses remain to be determined
with the intention of developing a standardised method for assessment of pathogenicity of cryptosporidium parvum the cpb-0 isolate was studied by propagation in 1-day-old calves followed by inoculation into specific pathogen free spf piglets the experiment was repeated diarrhoea and shedding of oocysts were seen in all animals infected with the cpb-0 isolate clinical signs included depression inappetence vomiting exclusively in the piglets and death histological examination at 17 and 19 days post-infection revealed parasitic stages and microscopic changes primarily restricted to colon and rectum the unintended presence of rotavirus in some of the experimental animals revealed an additive or synergistic effect between rotavirus and c parvum as indicated by prolonged diarrhoea increased oocyst shedding decreased weight gain and elevated levels of serum haptoglobin and serum amyloid a saa in piglets infected simultaneously with both pathogens the difference in daily weight gain between infected and control animals was significant only for piglets co-infected with rotavirus the acute phase response of haptoglobin and saa was characterised by a large individual variation in piglets co-infected with rotavirus the levels of serum haptoglobin were 3.5 and 4.6 times higher in the infected versus the controls 6 and 9 dpi respectively mean values 2411 g/ml±s d 2023 and 1840 g/ml ± s d 1697 in the controls infected with rotavirus peak haptoglobin concentration was seen 3 dpi mean 1022 g/ml ± s d 425 elevated levels of saa were seen in 1 of 6 piglets infected with c parvum and in 5 of 6 piglets co-infected with rotavirus tumour necrosis factor alpha tnf␣ was undetectable in all serum samples from piglets the obvious advantages of the spf pig model are the naturally acquired intestinal microflora the development of distinct clinical signs similar to cryptosporidiosis in humans and calves the size of the animals and the accessibility of individuals born within a short time span this makes the model ideal for dose-response studies evaluation of therapeutic agents as well as for assessment of differences in the clinical response to isolates of diverse genetic background in conclusion it was shown that the cpb-0 isolate was pathogenic to calves and piglets at a dose of 2.5 × 10 5 oocysts and that the clinical signs could be replicated during separate experiments moreover diarrhoea oocyst shedding body weight changes histological alterations and the acute phase response of haptoglobin and saa were identified as useful parameters for discrimination of isolate-specific differences of pathogenicity
infectious bronchitis virus ibv affects poultry respiratory renal and reproductive systems currently the efficacy of available live attenuated or killed vaccines against ibv has been challenged we designed a novel ibv vaccine alternative using a highly innovative platform called self-assembling protein nanoparticle sapn in this vaccine b cell epitopes derived from the second heptad repeat hr2 region of ibv spike proteins were repetitively presented in its native trimeric conformation in addition flagellin was co-displayed in the sapn to achieve a self-adjuvanted effect three groups of chickens were immunized at four weeks of age with the vaccine prototype ibv-flagellin-sapn a negative-control construct flagellin-sapn or a buffer control the immunized chickens were challenged with 5x10 4.7 eid50 ibv m41 strain high antibody responses were detected in chickens immunized with ibv-flagellin-sapn in ex vivo proliferation tests peripheral mononuclear cells pbmcs derived from ibv-flagellin-sapn immunized chickens had a significantly higher stimulation index than that of pbmcs from chickens receiving flagellin-sapn chickens immunized with ibv-flagellin-sapn had a significant reduction of tracheal virus shedding and lesser tracheal lesion scores than did negative control chickens the data demonstrated that the ibv-flagellin-sapn holds promise as a vaccine for ibv
known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated in animals and made use of intermediate hosts for transmission to humans the intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known but not for hcov-nl63 this study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of hcov-nl63 we developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with elisa and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against hcov-nl63 in livestock optimization of the elisa showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish hcov-nl63 from hcov-229e u = 27.50 p < 0.001 and hcov-oc43 u = 55.50 p < 0.001 in coronavirus-characterized sera evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified hcov-nl63-positive and hcov-nl63-negative samples f 1 215 = 0.437 p = 0.509 all the top 5% n = 8 most reactive human samples tested by elisa were hcov-nl63 positive by immunofluorescence testing in comparison only a proportion 84% n = 42 of the top 25% were positive by immunofluorescence testing indicating an increased probability of the highly elisa reactive samples testing positive by the immunofluorescence assay none of the top 5% most elisa reactive livestock samples were positive for hcov-nl63-related viruses by immunofluorescence confirmation ghanaian domestic livestock are not likely intermediate hosts of hcov-nl63-related coronaviruses
induction of effective cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl and/or a specific antibody against conserved viral proteins may be essential to the development of a safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov vaccine dna vaccination represents a new strategy for induction of humoral and cellular immune response to determine the ability of sars-cov nucleoprotein n protein to induce antiviral immunity in this report we established a stable c2c12 line expressing sars-cov n protein which was used as a target for specific ctl assay we also expressed recombinant n proteins in escherichia coli and prepared n protein-specific polyclonal antibodies c3h/he mice were immunized with n protein-expressible pcdn-fn vector by intramuscular injections we found that the dna vaccination induced both n protein-specific antibody and specific ctl activity to the target when c3h/he mice were immunized by three separate injections high antibody titre 13200-16400 average titre is 14580 and high ctl activity 67.4 ± 8.4% et = 251 69.6 ± 6.7% et = 501 and 71.8 ± 6.2% et = 1001 were observed in the case of two vaccine injections ctl activity was also high 56.6 ± 12.7% et = 251 57.4 ± 11.7% et = 501 and 63.0 ± 6.3% et = 1001 however antibody titres were much lower 1200-13200 average titre is 1980 our results suggest that sars-cov nucleocapsid gene might be a candidate gene for sars dna vaccination
pseudorabies virus prv primarily infects swine but can infect cattle dogs and cats several studies have reported that prv can cross the specie barrier and induce human encephalitis but a definitive diagnosis of human prv encephalitis is debatable due to the lack of prv dna detection here we report a case of human prv encephalitis diagnosed by the next-generation sequencing ngs of prv sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid csf of a patient a male pork vendor developed fever and seizures for 6 days ngs results showed prv sequences in his csf and blood sanger sequencing showed that prv dna in the csf and prv antibodies in both the csf and blood were positive mri results revealed multiple inflammatory lesions in the bilateral hemisphere based on the clinical and laboratory data we diagnosed the patient with prv encephalitis this case suggests that prv can infect humans causing severe viral encephalitis people at risk of prv infection should improve their self-protection awareness
monoclonal antibodies to the quebec isolate of bovine coronavirus were produced and characterized . monoclonal antibodies to both the e2 and the e3 glycoproteins were found to efficiently neutralize virus in vitro none of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the el glycoprotein neutralized virus infectivity . neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the e2 glycoprotein were all found to immunoprecipitate gpl 90 gpl 00 and their intracellular precursor protein gp170 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the e3 glycoprotein immunoprecipitated gp124 and showed differential reactivity to its precursor proteins gp59 and gpl 18 . these monoclonal antibodies also showed differential reactivity to an apparent degradation product of e3 . neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to e2 bound to two distinct nonoverlappig antigenic domains as defined by competitive binding assays . neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the e3 glycoprotein also bound to two distinct antigenic sites as defined by competitive binding assays plus a third site which overlapped these regions . other results indicated that one domain on the e3 glycoprotein could be further subdivided into two epitopes . thus four epitopes could be defined by e3-specific monoclonal antibodies . c 1987 academic press inc .
genomic relationships between turkey and bovine coronavirus tcv and bcv which are currently placed in distinct antigenic groups were demonstrated by hybridization using specific cdna probes bcv-specific recombinant plasmid probes p 52 p 27 and p 247 holding inserts derived from probably nonstructural genes and plasmids pn 17 and pn 9 holding the n and m gene respectively permitted the detection of isolates of both bcv and tcv with similar sensitivities similarly probing supernatants of cell cultures infected with several isolates of tcv using probes pn 17 and pm 78 respectively holding the n gene of bcv and tcv resulted in equally intense detection signals only a slight detection of mhv-3 which is antigenically related to bcv was observed whereas the probes did not allow the detection of ibv tgev and hcv-229e which are placed in antigenic groups separate from those of bcv and tcv detection of tcv was improved by hybridization with bcv-specific single-stranded ss probes holding sequences of the n and m genes and synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of tcv in 134 clinical samples by hybridization was better with pcr-produced ss bcv-specific probes than with ds pcr-produced probes or a combination of six recombinant plasmid probes holding non-overlapping bcv-specific cdna sequences detection signals were absent when probing clinical samples with 32p-labelled puc-dna
newcastle disease virus ndv a member of the paramyxoviridae family and influenza virus from the orthomyxoviridae family are two main avian pathogens that cause serious economic problems in poultry farming ndv strains are classified into three major pathotypes velogenic mesogenic and lentogenic avian influenza viruses aiv are also divided into low pathogenic lpai and highly pathogenic hpai strains both viruses are enveloped single stranded negative-sense rna viruses which give similar symptoms ranging from sub-clinical infections to severe disease including loss in egg production acute respiratory syndrome and high mortality depending on their level of pathogenicity this similarity hinders diagnosis when based solely on clinical and post mortem examination most of the currently available molecular detection methods are also pathogenspecific so that more than one rt-pcr is then required to confirm or exclude the presence of both pathogens to overcome this disadvantage we have applied a one step duplex rt-pcr method to distinguish between those two pathogens the main objective of the project was to develop a universal fast and inexpensive method which could be used in any veterinary laboratory © versita sp z o o
we assessed the prevalence and performed molecular analysis of cryptosporidium spp in diarrheal feces of calves in korea diarrheal fecal samples were collected from 951 young calves <3 months on 425 farms cryptosporidium prevalence was assessed by pcr and elisa and molecular characterization was performed by targeting the 18s rrna heat-shock protein 70 hsp70 and glycoprotein 60 gp60 genes data were analyzed according to the sex type of cattle region season and type of diarrhea pcr analysis revealed cryptosporidium spp in 9.9% 94/951 of diarrheal fecal samples c parvum and c bovis/ryanae were present in 6.1% 58/951 and 4.1% 39/951 of diarrheal fecal samples respectively in addition elisa showed positive results for c parvum in 9.7% 92/951 samples statistical analysis of the pcr and elisa results revealed a lower prevalence of c parvum in the hemorrhagic diarrheal samples p < 0.05 for c bovis/ryanae seasonality and high prevalence in hemorrhagic diarrhea were observed p < 0.05 of the 951 samples tested for c parvum 903 samples showed agreement with a value of 0.65 indicating good agreement between the two tests although c bovis and c ryanae share highly similar 18s rrna sequences pcr based on hsp70 successfully distinguished c bovis from c ryanae sequence analysis of gp60 revealed that c parvum belonged to the iia families and was further subtyped as iiaa18g3r1 and iiaa16g3r1 which have not been previously reported in asia these findings indicate that cryptosporidium spp play an important role in diarrhea in young calves in korea considering the zoonotic significance of c parvum iia subtype and dense rearing system of cattle in korea prevention and continuous monitoring of cryptosporidium are required
bats are implicated as the natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic viruses that can infect other animal species including man here we investigate the potential for two recently discovered bat rubulaviruses achimota virus 1 achpv1 and achimota virus 2 achpv2 isolated from urine collected under urban bat eidolon helvum roosts in ghana west africa to infect small laboratory animals achpv1 and achpv2 are classified in the family paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses i e sosuga menangle and tioman viruses to assess the susceptibility of achpv1 and achpv2 in animals infection studies were conducted in ferrets guinea pigs and mice seroconversion immunohistological evidence of infection and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs but not in mice infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues the results from this study indicate achimota viruses achpvs are able to cross the species barrier consequently vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-saharan africa and the arabian peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present
a novel coronavirus cov has been described in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the virus sars-cov differs from the previously described human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 229e was previously shown to productively infect human monocytes/macrophages whereas oc43 poorly infected the cells in this study we examined whether sars-cov could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages pm derived from human donor cells unlike 229e-infected cells which produced viral titers of 10 3.5 to 10 6 tcid 50 /ml sars-cov replicated poorly in pm producing titers of 10 1.75 to 10 2 tcid 50 /ml this finding was similar to results reported for oc43-infected cells with titers ranging from 10 1.2 to 10 2.7 tcid 50 /ml of interest sars-cov proteins were detected only in pm that did not produce significant amounts of interferon ifn-␣ and in one such case preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that sars-cov-like particles could enter the cells possibly via phagocytosis these results suggest that sars-cov like human cov oc43 poorly infects human pm and production of ifn-␣ by these cells further limits the infection given the importance of monocytes/macrophages to the immune response it is possible that their infection by sars-cov and alteration of this infection by ifn-␣ may be important to the course of the infection in humans published by elsevier b v
a total of 1068 asymptomatic close contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory sars from the 2003 epidemic in hong kong were serologically tested and 2 0.19% were positive for sars coronavirus immunoglobulin g antibody sars rarely manifests as a subclinical infection and at present wild animal species are the only important natural reservoirs of the virus
the seroprevalence of porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv among breeding sows was estimated in castilla y le6n the largest region in spain by a cross-sectional study serum samples 1247 were taken from sows from 58 different herds for this purpose throughout 1988 and were tested by a monoclonal antibody-capture elisa macelisa a test which detects antibodies to both transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and prcv in order to discriminate positive sera to both coronaviruses a blocking inhibition elisa was used for all macelisa-positive sera by macelisa 31.4% of sera tested were positive and all of them were confirmed specifically as prcv-positive by blocking inhibition elisa thus ruling out the presence of tgev in the sampled area 64% of the farms had at least one prcv-seropositive sow indicating that the infection was widespread farms were classified into three categories according to size and management practices no significant differences were found in the prevalence rates among the three farm types there was however a highly significant correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity
the virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans and still posed a serious threat to the global public health the virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics however there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential this study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences the k-nearest neighbor knn model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. even for the knn models built on the contigs as short as 1kb they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences this work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies
the arthropod-transmitted chikungunya virus chikv causes a flu-like disease that is characterized by incapacitating arthralgia the re-emergence of chikv and the continual risk of new epidemics have reignited research in chikv pathogenesis virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity to explore this occurrence chikv infection was investigated in the presence of chikv-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line raw264.7 enhanced attachment of chikv to the primary human monocytes and b cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in raw264.7 cells blocking of specific fc receptors fcγrs led to the abrogation of these observations furthermore experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral rna loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of chikv-specific antibodies in addition chikv infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral rna load detected and death these observations provide the first evidence of antibody-mediated enhancement in chikv infection and pathogenesis and could also be relevant for other important arboviruses such as zika virus chikungunya virus chikv is a member of the alphavirus genus of the togaviridae family 12 . it is responsible for chikungunya fever chikf a disease characterized by the presence of incapacitating arthralgia 3 . chikv is transmitted by arthropod vectors such as the aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes with the latter being implicated in the transmission of chikv during the 2005-2006 indian ocean outbreak and in europe 4 . for the past decade re-emergence of chikv has led to numerous outbreaks in different parts of the world asia 5-12 europe 41314 and islands in the indian ocean 1516 . outbreaks of chikv infections have also been reported in the caribbean islands 1718 and chikv has since successfully invaded north central and south america 19 .enhancement of arbovirus infections via antibodies was first demonstrated in 1964 20 . this is a paradoxical phenomenon of antibodies forming complexes by binding to viruses which then interact with cell surface receptors and promote entry into susceptible host cells subsequently increasing virus replication 2122 . this was observed for rabies virus 23 influenza virus 24 dengue virus denv 2526 ross river virus rrv 27 human immunodeficiency virus hiv 28 and marburg virus 29 . among alphaviruses although virus enhancement was documented only in rrv infections 2730-32 most of these studies were conducted using in vitro murine cell line-based
middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus mers-cov is an emerging virus that causes severe disease with fatal outcomes however there are currently no approved vaccines or specific treatments against mers-cov here we developed a novel bivalent vaccine against mers-cov and rabies virus rv using the replication-incompetent p-genedeficient rv rvδp which has been previously established as a promising and safe viral vector mers-cov spike glycoprotein comprises s1 and s2 subunits with the s1 subunit being a primary target of neutralizing antibodies recombinant rvδp which expresses s1 fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ectodomains of the rv-glycoprotein rv-g was developed using a reverse genetics method and named rvδp-mers/s1 following generation of rvδp-mers/s1 and rvδp our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties with the expression of s1 in rvδp-mers/s1-infected cells confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot and the immunogenicity and pathogenicity evaluated using mouse infection experiments we observed no rabies-associated signs or symptoms in mice inoculated with rvδp-mers/ s1 moreover virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against both mers-cov and rv were induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with rvδp-mers/s1 these findings indicate that rvδp-mers/s1 is a promising and safe bivalent-vaccine candidate against both mers-cov and rv
understanding immune responses elicited by vaccines together with immune responses required for protection is fundamental to designing effective vaccines and immunisation programs this study examines the effects of the route of administration of a live attenuated vaccine on its interactions with and stimulation of the murine immune system as well as its ability to increase survival and provide protection from colonisation by a virulent challenge strain we assess the effect of administration method using the murine model for typhoid where animals are infected with s typhimurium mice were vaccinated either intravenously or orally with the same live attenuated s typhimurium strain and data were collected on vaccine strain growth shedding and stimulation of antibodies and cytokines following vaccination mice were challenged with a virulent strain of s typhimurium and the protection conferred by the different vaccination routes was measured in terms of challenge suppression and animal survival the main difference in immune stimulation found in this study was the development of a secretory iga response in orally-vaccinated mice which was absent in iv vaccinated mice while both strains showed similar protection in terms of challenge suppression in systemic organs spleen and liver as well as survival they differed in terms of challenge suppression of virulent pathogens in gut-associated organs this difference in gut colonisation presents important questions around the ability of vaccines to prevent shedding and transmission these findings demonstrate that while protection conferred by two vaccines can appear to be the same the mechanisms controlling the protection can differ and have important implications for infection dynamics within a population
a polyclonal antibody-based antigen-capture elisa ac-elisa has been developed for detection of canine parvovirus cpv antigens in faecal samples of dogs the assay uses rabbit anti-cpv polyclonal antibody as the capture antibody guinea pig anti-cpv polyclonal antibody as tracing antibody and anti-guinea pig hrpo conjugate as the detection system the optimum dilution of the capture antibody and the tracing antibody capable of detecting the cpv-2 antigens was found to be 11 600 and 1400 respectively in the check-board titration in this study a total of 152 samples 129 faecal samples and 23 cell culture supernatant were tested both by ac-elisa and by polymerase chain reaction pcr of the samples tested 69 and 78 samples were found positive by ac-elisa and pcr respectively the ac-elisa had relative sensitivity relative specificity and accuracy of 88.4% 100.0% and 91.4% respectively the analytical sensitivity of ac-elisa was estimated to be 10 2.8 tcid 50 /ml whereas pcr sensitivity was 10 0.8 tcid 50 /ml the ac-elisa is a simple quick and reliable method for screening large numbers of faecal samples of dogs suspected of cpv infection
foodborne viruses particularly human norovirus nv and hepatitis virus type a are a cause of concern for public health making it necessary to explore novel and effective techniques for prevention of foodborne viral contamination especially in minimally processed and ready-to-eat foods this study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of a probiotic lactic acid bacterium lab against feline calicivirus fcv a surrogate of human nv bacterial growth medium filtrate bgmf of lactococcus lactis subsp lactis lm0230 and its bacterial cell suspension bcs were evaluated separately for their antiviral activity against fcv grown in crandell-reese feline kidney crfk cells no significant antiviral effect was seen when crfk cells were pre-treated with either bgmf raw or ph 7-adjusted bgmf or bcs however pre-treatment of fcv with bgmf and bcs resulted in a reduction in virus titers of 1.3 log 10 tissue culture infectious dose tcid 50 and 1.8 log 10 tcid 50 respectively the highest reductions in fcv infectivity were obtained when crfk cells were co-treated with fcv and ph 7-adjusted bgmf or with fcv and bcs 7.5 log 10 tcid 50 and 6.0 log 10 tcid 50 respectively these preliminary results are encouraging and indicate the need for continued studies on the role of probiotics and lab on inactivation of viruses in various types of foods
coronaviruses have a wide host range and can cause a variety of diseases with varying severity in different animals several enteric coronaviruses have been identified that are associated with diarrhea in swine and that have caused substantial economic losses in this study a newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus peav peav-gd-ch/2017 was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern china and a fulllength genome sequence of peav was obtained for systematic analysis the novel peav sequence was most identical to that of bat-hku2 and the differences between them were comprehensively compared especially the uniform features of the s protein which was shown to have a close relationship with betacoronaviruses and to perhaps represent unrecognized betacoronaviruses in addition bayesian analysis was conducted to address the origin of peav and the divergence time between peav and bat-hku2 was estimated at 1926 which indicates that peav is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since the interspecies transmission of this coronavirus from bat to swine the evolutionary rate of coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year for the rdrp gene in our analysis for the origin of peav we suspect that it is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-hku2 from bat to swine our results provide valuable information about the uniform features origin and evolution of the novel peav which will facilitate further investigations of this newly emerged pathogen
the study of viral molecular genetics has produced a considerable body of research into the sequences and phylogenetic relationships of human and animal viruses a review of this literature suggests that humans have been afflicted by viruses throughout their evolutionary history although the number and types have changed some viruses show evidence of long-standing intimate relationship and cospeciation with hominids while others are more recently acquired from other species including african monkeys and apes while our line was evolving in that continent and domesticated animals and rodents since the neolithic viral selection for specific resistance polymorphisms is unlikely but in conjunction with other parasites viruses have probably contributed to selection pressure maintaining major histocompatibility complex mhc diversity and a strong immune response they may also have played a role in the loss in our lineage of n-glycolylneuraminic acid neu5gc a cell-surface receptor for many infectious agents shared viruses could have affected hominid species diversity both by promoting divergence and by weeding out less resistant host populations while viruses carried by humans and other animals migrating out of africa may have contributed to declines in other populations endogenous retroviral insertions since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees were capable of directly affecting hominid evolution through changes in gene expression and development
the kakegawa strain of bovine coronavirus was easily propagated in suckling mice infected animals died with nervous symptoms and serial passage was readily accomplished by intraeerebral inoculation with brain emulsions the 3rd passage viral material from infected mice evoked the same disease in suckling mice rats and hamsters inoculated by the intracerebral or by the subcutaneous route viruses recovered from mice rats and hamsters could be clearly differentiated from mouse hepatitis virus strain 2 by the neutralization test a bovine coronavirus bcv has been recognized as one of the causative agents of diarrhea in calves 8 l~ecently the kakagawa strain isolated from the feces of a cow with cpizootic diarrhea has been identified as bcv 1 9 . however the study of bovine diarrheal disease produced by coronavirus has been greatly hampered by difficulty in isolating virus in cell cultures and the lack of experimental hosts other than cattle recently many members of the eorona~drus family" have been found to grow in suckling mice 5--7 the present paper describes briefly our recent observation that the kakegawa strain of bcv readily propagates in suckling mice rats and hamsters the kakegawa strain of bcv used for mouse inoculation was at the 10th passage level in primary bovine kidney cell cultures conventionally reared oneday-old mice strain ddy rats and syrian hamsters were each inoculated with 0.01-ml of the viral materials by the intracerebral ic route and with 0.02-ml by 25b*
the resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is still a threat because the causative agent remaining in animal reservoirs is not fully understood and sporadic cases continue to be reported developing high titers of anti-sars hyperimmune globulin to provide an alternative pathway for emergent future prevention and treatment of sars methods sars coronavirus covf69 ay313906 and z2-y3 ay394989 were isolated and identified from 2 different cantonese onset sars patients immunogen was prepared from sars-cov f69 strain six health horses were immunized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific igg and neutralizing antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a microneutralization test sera were collected in large amounts at the peak where igg was precipitated using ammonium sulphate and subsequently digested with pepsin the product was then purified using anion-exchange chromatography to obtain fab' 2 fragments results the specific igg and neutralizing antibody titers peaked at approximately week 7 after the first immunization with a maximum value of 114210 the sera collected at the peak were then purified fragment of approximately 15 g fab' 2 was obtained from 1 litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 15120 which could neutralize the other strain sars-cov z2-y3 as well conclusion this research provides a viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of sars coronavirus infection with equine hyperimmune globulin with the purpose of combating any resurgence of sars
bats have been shown to serve as natural reservoirs for numerous emerging viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in the present study we report the discovery of bat cov genes in indonesian moluccan naked-backed fruit bats dobsonia moluccensis a partial rna-dependent rna polymerase gene sequence was detected in feces and tissues samples from the fruit bats and the region between the rdrp and helicase genes could also be amplified from fecal samples phylogenetic analysis suggested that these bat covs are related to members of the genus betacoronavirus
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection causes an acute enteric tract infectious disease characterized by vomiting anorexia dehydration weight loss and high mortality in neonatal piglets during pedv infection the spike protein s is a major virion structural protein interacting with receptors and inducing neutralizing antibodies however the neutralizing b-cell epitopes within pedv s protein have not been well studied methods to accurately identify the important immunodominant region of s1 the purified truncated s1 proteins sa sb sc sd and se were used to immunize balb/c mice to prepare polyclonal antibodies the antisera titers were determined by indirect elisa western blot and ifa after four immunizations to find the important immunodominant region of s1 and then purified the immunodominant region of s1 protein and immunized mice to generate the special antibodies and then used recombinant peptides to determine the b-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies results five antisera of recombinant proteins of the spike protein region of pedv were generated and we found that only the polyclonal antibody against part of the s1 region signed as se protein residues 666-789 could recognize the native pedv purified se protein was used to immunize balb/c mice and generate mab 2e10 pepscan of the se protein demonstrated that se16 722 sstfnstrel 731 is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mab 2e10 further investigation indicated that the epitope se16 was localized on the surface of pedv s protein in the 3d structure conclusions a mab 2e10 that is specifically bound to pedv was generated and identified a specific linear b-cell epitope se16 722 sstfnstrel 731 of the mab the epitope region of pedv s1 localized in the different regions in comparison with the earlier identified epitopes these findings enhance the understanding of the pedv spike protein structure for vaccine design and provide a potential use for developing diagnostic methods to detect pedv
conidiobolomycosis is a rare fungal disease of both humans and animals occurring mainly in tropical and subtropical climates we describe a disseminated fungal infection in a young apparently immunocompetent dog who initially presented for antibiotic resistant pneumonia histopathology and mycology identified a conidiobolus sp further confirmed as conidiobolus incongruus through dna sequencing of d1/d2 regions this is the first report of this species causing disease in dogs and the fifth reported infection in animals
house ßies musca domestica l diptera muscidae were examined for their ability to harbor and transmit newcastle disease virus family paramyxoviridae genus avulavirus ndv by using a mesogenic ndv strain laboratory-reared ßies were experimentally exposed to ndv roakin strain by allowing ßies to imbibe an inoculum consisting of chicken embryo-propagated virus ndv was detected in dissected crops and intestinal tissues from exposed ßies for up to 96 and 24 h postexposure respectively no virus was detected in crops and intestines of sham-exposed ßies the potential of the house ßy to directly transmit ndv to live chickens was examined by placing 14-d-old chickens in contact with ndv-exposed house ßies 2 h after ßies consumed ndv inoculum ndvexposed house ßies contained ϸ10 4 50% infectious doses id 50 per ßy but no transmission of ndv was observed in chickens placed in contact with exposed ßies at densities as high as 25 ßies per bird subsequent doseðresponse studies demonstrated that oral exposure the most likely route for ßy-tochicken transmission required an ndv roakin dose ն10 6 id 50 . these results indicate that house ßies are capable of harboring ndv roakin but that they are poor vectors of the virus because they carry an insufþcient virus titer to cause infection
since emerging in 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has been a global public health threat with a high fatality rate and worldwide distribution there are no approved vaccines or therapies for mers until now passive immunotherapy with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies mabs is an effective prophylactic and therapeutic reagent against emerging viruses in this article we review current advances in neutralizing mabs against mers-cov the receptor-binding domain rbd in the spike protein of mers-cov is a major target and mouse camel or human-derived neutralizing mabs targeting rbd have been developed a major problem with neutralizing mab therapy is mutant escape under selective pressure which can be solved by combination of neutralizing mabs targeting different epitopes neutralizing mabs are currently under preclinical evaluation and they are promising candidate therapeutic agents against mers-cov infection
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused enormous economic losses to the global pig industry currently available pedv vaccine strains have limited protective effects against pedv variant strains methods in this study the highly virulent epidemic virus strain ct was serially passaged in vero cells for up to 120 generations p120 characterization of the different passages revealed that compared with p10 and p64 p120 had a higher viral titer and more obvious cytopathic effects thereby demonstrating better cell adaptability results pathogenicity experiments using p120 in piglets revealed significant reductions in clinical symptoms histopathological lesions and intestinal pedv antigen distribution the piglet survival rate in the p120 group was 100%. furthermore whole-genome sequencing identified 13 amino acid changes in p120 which might be responsible for the attenuated virulence of p120 conclusions thus an attenuated strain was obtained via cell passaging and that this strain could be used in preparing attenuated vaccines
invasive non-native species are a major threat to global biodiversity stoats were introduced from britain to new zealand in the 1880s and have since caused grave conservation problems a histopathological and serological survey of disease and infection in stoats from new zealand was undertaken to identify agents that might be used or modified to control this population of 60 stoats examined 63% exhibited inflammation of the lung mostly occurring as local or diffuse interstitial pneumonia 30% showed signs of inflammatory liver disease and 14% were positive for antibodies reactive with feline calicivirus in britain only 11% of 44 stoats exhibited symptoms of pulmonary inflammatory disease suggesting higher rates of infection or compromise of the pulmonary immune system among invasive stoats possibly related to genetic founder effects or environmental variation these findings could be exploited in biological control programmes
emerging viral pathogens include newly discovered viruses as well as previously known viruses that are either increasing or threatening to increase in incidence while often first identified in the general population they may affect transplant recipients in whom their manifestations may be atypical or more severe enhanced molecular methods have increased the rate of viral discovery but have not overcome the problem of demonstrating pathogenicity at the same time improved clinical diagnostic methods have increased the detection of reemerging viruses in immunocompromised patients in this review we first discuss viral diagnostics and the developing field of viral discovery and then focus on rare and emerging viruses in the transplant population human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 hepatitis e virus bocavirus ki and wu polyomaviruses coronaviruses hku1 and nl63 influenza h1n1 measles dengue rabies and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus detection and reporting of such rare pathogens in transplant recipients is critical to patient care and improving our understanding of posttransplant infections
bats are flying mammals distributed worldwide known to host several types of coronavirus cov since they were reported as the probable source of spillover of highly pathogenic cov into the human population investigating the circulation of this virus in bats around the world became of great importance we analyzed samples from 103 bats from two distinct regions in brazil coronavirus from the alphacoronavirus genus was detected in 12 animals 11 from são josé do rio preto-sp region and 1 from barreiras-ba region resulting in a prevalence of 17.18% and 2.56% respectively the virus was detected not only in intestines but also in lungs and liver phylogenetic analysis based on nsp12 genomic region suggests that the sequences group according to host family and sampling location studies on the circulation of these viruses in bats remain important to understand the ecology and evolutionary relationship of these pathogens

macaques have served as models for more than 70 human infectious diseases of diverse etiologies including a multitude of agents-bacteria viruses fungi parasites prions the remarkable diversity of human infectious diseases that have been modeled in the macaque includes global childhood and tropical diseases as well as newly emergent sexually transmitted oncogenic degenerative neurologic potential bioterrorism and miscellaneous other diseases historically macaques played a major role in establishing the etiology of yellow fever polio and prion diseases with rare exceptions chagas disease bartonellosis all of the infectious diseases in this review are of old world origin perhaps most surprising is the large number of tropical 16 newly emergent 7 and bioterrorism diseases 9 that have been modeled in macaques many of these human diseases e g aids hepatitis e bartonellosis are a consequence of zoonotic infection however infectious agents of certain diseases including measles and tuberculosis can sometimes go both ways and thus several human pathogens are threats to nonhuman primates including macaques through experimental studies in macaques researchers have gained insight into pathogenic mechanisms and novel treatment and vaccine approaches for many human infectious diseases most notably acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids which is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus hiv other infectious agents for which macaques have been a uniquely valuable resource for biomedical research and particularly vaccinology include influenza virus paramyxoviruses flaviviruses arenaviruses hepatitis e virus papillomavirus smallpox virus mycobacteria bacillus anthracis helicobacter pylori yersinia pestis and plasmodium species this review summarizes the extensive past and present research on macaque models of human infectious disease
the proportion of diarrheal illnesses of unknown origin that were associated with small round virus srv 23-38 nm particles among children <2 years old attending an outpatient clinic in baltimore was determined during a 9-month period stool specimens from 188 patients with acute diarrhea and 108 healthy age-matched control children were examined for enteric bacterial pathogens protozoa enteric adenovirus and rotavirus an enteropathogen was identified in 75 patients 40% and in 21 controls 20%. a random sample of specimens without an identifiable pathogen wasthen examined for srv particles by immune electron microscopy ibm using commercial human gamma globulin viruses of26-30 nm diameter that were not enteroviruses were detected in specimens from 9 12.5% of the 7l patients and 1 1.8% of the 53 control subjects p < .04 of 6 patients with available acute and convalescent sera 4 demonstrated a significant immune response when tested by ibm all patients experienced a mild self-limited 1-3 days illness these findings suggest that srv may be endemic in the baltimore community and may result in clinically significant diarrheal illnesses
feline coronaviruses fcov vary widely in virulence causing a spectrum of clinical manifestations reaching from subclinical course to fatal feline infectious peritonitis fip independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types type i the original fcov and type ii which is closely related to canine coronavirus ccv the prevalence of fcov types in austrian cat populations without fip has been surveyed recently indicating that type i infections predominate the distribution of fcov types in cats which had succumbed to fip however was fairly unknown pcr assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene type-specific primer pairs were designed generating pcr products of different sizes a total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified fip was tested a clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats 86% of them were type i positive 7% type ii positive and 7% were positive for both types these findings demonstrate that in fip cases fcov type i predominates too nonetheless in 14% of the cases fcov type ii was detected suggesting its causative involvement in cases of fip
west nile virus genus flavivirus is transmitted between birds and occasionally other animals by ornithophilic mosquitoes this virus also infects humans causing asymptomatic infections in about 85% of cases and <1% of clinical cases progress to severe neuroinvasive disease the virus also presents a threat since most infections remain unapparent however the virus contained in blood and organs from asymptomatically infected donors can be transmitted to recipients of these infectious tissues this paper reviews the presently available methods to achieve the laboratory diagnosis of west nile virus infections in humans discussing the most prominent advantages and disadvantages of each in light of the results obtained during four different external quality assessment studies carried out by the european network for 'imported' viral diseases enivd
rapid development of diagnostic immunoassays against novel emerging or genetically modified pathogens in an emergency situation is dependent on the timely isolation of specific antibodies non-immune antibody phage display libraries are an efficient in vitro method for selecting monoclonal antibodies and hence ideal in these circumstances such libraries can be constructed from a variety of sources e g b cell cdna or synthetically generated and use a variety of antibody formats typically scfv or fab however antibody source and format can impact on the quality of antibodies generated and hence the effectiveness of this methodology for the timely production of antibodies we have carried out a comparative screening of two antibody libraries a semi-synthetic scfv library and a human-derived fab library against the protective antigen toxin component of bacillus anthracis and the epsilon toxin of clostridium botulinum we have shown that while the synthetic library produced a diverse collection of specific scfv-phage these contained a high frequency of unnatural amber stops and glycosylation sites which limited their conversion to igg and also a high number which lost specificity when expressed as igg in contrast these limitations were overcome by the use of a natural human library antibodies from both libraries could be used to develop sandwich elisa assays with similar sensitivity however the ease and speed with which full-length igg could be generated from the human-derived fab library makes screening this type of library the preferable method for rapid antibody generation for diagnostic assay development

in a search for differential specific characters the outer epidermis of the testa from strophanthus seeds of 15 species has been examined a "trichome index" has been defined and the method of its determination described it enabled the species studied to be divided into six groups the genus strophanthus includes over 60 species the seeds of about 30 of which have been subjected to chemical examination since the first study of the pharmacognosy of strophunthus by elbornel in 1887 many workers have searched for characters by which the seeds of one species might be readily distinguished from another the seeds are morphologically similar hence much reliance has been placed on chemical tests as a means of distinguishing them in 1927 mathiesen2 studied authentic seeds of several species checking details of anatomical structure and searching for diagnostic characters for samples of commercial seed results of the sulphuric acid colour test on fourteen species were recorded showing the variety of colours produced during the course of the reaction on a single species and the similarity of colours produced in several different species fourteen colour tests were investigated by smelts who recommended the use of four tests to distinguish between s kombk oliver and s emini aschers the numerous chemical studies of jacobs of stoll and of reichstein have shown the variation in constituents according to species the possible use of sarmentogenin in cortisone syntheses caused a period of renewed interest in the genus during which some confusion between seeds of the various species occurred several expeditions explored africa from 1949 to 1951 to collect as many species as p~s s i b l e~~ and the material had been studied botanically by monachin0~9~ who reviewed the genus observing polymorphism in species having a wide geographical distribution youngken and simonians illustrated the morphological characters of four species bush and taylorq found the sulphuric acid test to be unreliable and largely dependent on substances other than cardiac glycosides they developed a paper chromatographic method for the routine semi-micro investigation of the easily hydrolysable glycosides of the seeds and classified 24 species into three groups this method was suggested as a test for seed samples to replace the sulphuric acid colour test although such structural differences as do occur in the seeds of various species of strophunthus are of degree rather than of kind methods depending on numerical relationships between tissues cells or cell inclusions have 247 t
adenoviruses ad are commonly used as vectors for gene therapy and/or vaccine delivery recombinant ad vectors are being tested as vaccines for many pathogens we have made a surprising observation that peptides derived from various hepatitis c virus hcv antigens contain extensive regions of homology with multiple adenovirus proteins and conclusively demonstrate that adenovirus vector can induce robust heterologous cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple hcv antigens intriguingly the induction of this crossreactive immunity leads to significant reduction of viral loads in a recombinant vaccinia-hcv virus infected mouse model supporting their role in antiviral immunity against hcv healthy human subjects with ad-specific pre-existing immunity demonstrated cross-reactive cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple hcv antigens these findings reveal the potential of a previously uncharacterized property of natural human adenovirus infection to dictate modulate and/or alter the course of hcv infection upon exposure this intrinsic property of adenovirus vectors to cross-prime hcv immunity can also be exploited to develop a prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccine against hcv
determining the factors that influence the transmission of parasites among hosts is important for directing surveillance of animal parasites before they successfully emerge in humans and increasing the efficacy of programs for the control and management of zoonotic diseases here we present a review of recent advances in the study of parasite sharing wildlife ecology and epidemiology that could be extended and incorporated into proactive surveillance frameworks for multi-host infectious diseases these methods reflect emerging interdisciplinary techniques with significant promise for the identification of future zoonotic parasites and unknown reservoirs of current zoonoses strategies for the reduction of parasite prevalence and transmission among hosts and decreasing the burden of infectious diseases
the use of a live attenuated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv vaccine in piglets has been associated with reproductive disorders in non-vaccinated sows vaccine-derived virus vdv has been isolated from foetuses stillborn pigs and dead piglets indicating that the live vaccine spread from vaccinated piglets to non-vaccinated sows and that the virus might be implicated in the severe reproductive problems observed in the present study one such vdv isolate was used to experimentally infect pregnant sows in the last trimester the chosen isolate which had more than 99.6% identity to the attenuated vaccine virus originated from the lungs of a stillborn pig from a swine herd with a sudden high level of stillborn pigs and increased piglet mortality in the nursing period intranasal inoculation of sows with the virus isolate resulted in congenital infection foetal death and preweaning pig mortality as such the present study showed that vaccine-derived prrsv can cause disease in swine consistent with prrs #
feline infectious peritonitis fip caused by feline coronavirus fcov infection is a highly lethal disease without effective therapy and prevention with an immune-mediated disease entity host genetic variant was suggested to influence the occurrence of fip this study aimed at evaluating cytokine-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms snps i e tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf-α receptor-associated snps i e c-type lectin dc-sign cd209 and the five fip-associated snps identified from birman cats of usa and denmark origins and their associations with the outcome of fcov infection in 71 fip cats and 93 fcov infected non-fip cats in a genetically more diverse cat populations a promoter variant ftnfa -421 t was found to be a disease-resistance allele one snp was identified in the extracellular domain ecd of fcd209 at position +1900 a g to a substitution and the a allele was associated with fip susceptibility three snps located in the introns of fcd209 at positions +2276 +2392 and +2713 were identified to be associated with the outcome of fcov infection with statistical relevance in contrast among the five birman fip cat-associated snps no genotype or allele showed significant differences between our fip and non-fip groups as disease resistance is multifactorial and several other host genes could involve in the development of fip the five genetic traits identified in this study should facilitate in the future breeding of the disease-resistant animal to reduce the occurrence of cats succumbing to fip
the influenza virus genome is an 8-segment single-stranded rna with high potential for in situ recombination two segments code for the hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n antigens used for host-cell entry at present 16 h and 9 n subtypes are known for a total of 144 possible different influenza subtypes each with potentially different host susceptibility with 110000 species of birds found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat there are few places on earth where birds cannot be found the avian immune system differs from that of humans in several important features including asynchronous b and t lymphocyte systems and a polymorphic multigene immune complex but little is known about the immunogenetics of pathogenic response postbreeding dispersal and migration and a naturally high degree of environmental vagility mean that wild birds have the potential to be vectors that transmit highly pathogenic variants great distances from the original sources of infection
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is an economically important swine pathogen since its discovery in the early 1990s tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of prrsv although modified live-attenuated vaccines mlvs and inactivated vaccines against prrsv have been available for more than a decade the disease remains difficult to control the efficacies of these vaccines especially against heterologous strains remain questionable the mlvs were generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains and the outcomes of inactivated vaccines in the field are not very promising with the development of prrsv reverse genetics systems and the acquisition of new understanding on anti-prrsv immunity rational design of the next generation of prrsv vaccines can now be explored in this review we discussed the recent advances in anti-prrsv immunity and vaccinology the recent progresses in prrsv vaccine development particularly the reverse genetics system-based vaccine development and provided a perspective on potential novel strategies and approaches that may be applicable to the development of the next generation of prrsv vaccines
background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv is a rna virus with high genetic variation this virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries the clinical presentation of prrsv ranges from asymptomatic to devastating in this study we developed a sensitive and specific zip nucleic acid probe-based real-time pcr assay to evaluate the viremia of natural prrsv-infected pigs in taiwan serum samples were collected from 577 pigs aged 5-12 weeks these include 444 clinically healthy pigs and 133 symptomatic pigs were confirmed to have porcine respiratory disease complex prdc results viremia was quantified in 79 of the 444 17.8% clinically healthy pigs and in 112 of the 133 84.2% prdc cases viremias were significantly more common in pigs with prdc compared with the clinically healthy pigs p <0.0001 these results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of prrsv-affected pigs conclusions zna probe-based real-time pcr can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic prrsv-infected pigs the presence of this marker in a sample of animals with high prrsv loads >10 4.2 prrsv genomes/μl of serum seems to indicate that it correlates with the presence of prdc in pigs
providing protective immunity to neonatal animals in early life is associated with numerous challenges regarding vaccine safety and e⁄cacy a much simpler approach is maternal vaccination either before or during pregnancy to provide the neonate with passively transferred immunity in humans the medical societal and legal risks of immunizing pregnant women are important considerations in undertaking this approach by contrast maternal vaccination has been successfully employed in the animal health industry for decades these veterinary vaccines have proven to be safe and e⁄cient although only passively transferred antibodies have been extensively studied other immunological mechanisms may be equally important in providing maternally derived immunity r
bovine torovirus btov is recognized as an enteric pathogen of calves but its etiological role in diarrhea and epidemiological characterization in adult cows remain unclear in 2007-2008 three outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea occurred in adult cows at three dairy farms in niigata prefecture japan btov was the only enteric pathogen detected in these outbreaks as determined by electron microscopy reverse transcription-pcr bacteria and parasite tests of fecal samples and antibody tests with paired sera the epidemiological features of the three outbreaks were similar to those of bovine coronavirus infection except for the absence of bloody diarrhea with diarrhea spreading among most adult cows but not in calves within several days and diarrhea lasting for 3-5 days with anorexia decreased milk production and mild respiratory symptoms were also observed in two of the outbreaks nucleotide sequence analysis of the btov nucleocapsid spike and hemagglutinin-esterase he genes revealed a close relatedness among the detected btov strains from each outbreak and those of japanese btov strain aichi/2004 furthermore we isolated a btov strain designated niigata tc from a fecal sample using a human rectal tumor cell line sequence analysis of this isolate and aichi/2004 indicated that both strains have truncated he genes with deletions in the 3 0 region that occurred through cell culture-adaptation the short projections that are believed to be formed by the he protein on virus particles were not observed in these cultured strains by electron microscopy taken together these results suggest that btov causes epidemic diarrhea in adult cows and should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in adult cows in addition our findings indicate that the he protein of btov may not be necessary for viral replication
abstract：bats probably the most abundant diverse and geographically dispersed vertebrates on earth have recently been shown to be the reservoir hosts of a number of emerging viruses responsible for severe human and livestock disease outbreaks flying foxes have been demonstrated to be the natural reservoir for hendra and nipah viruses evidence supporting the possibility of bats as potential reservoirs for sars coronavirus sars-cov and ebola virus has also been reported the recent discovery of these viruses and other viruses occurring naturally in the bat population provides a unique insight into a diverse pool of potentially emergent and pathogenic viruses the factors which influence the ability of zoonotic viruses to effectively cross the species barrier from bats to other animal populations are poorly understood a brief review is provided here on the recently emerged bat viruses and on current and future strategies for research in this area

1 we present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions panthera leo in the serengeti national park and ngorongoro crater tanzania these populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus feline immunode®ciency virus fiv feline calicivirus feline parvovirus feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus cdv a seventh virus feline leukaemia virus felv was absent from these animals 2 comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and fiv were consistently prevalent at high levels indicating that they were endemic in the host populations feline calici- parvo-and coronavirus and cdv repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence 3 the timing of viral invasion suggests that dierent epidemic viruses are associated with dierent minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts furthermore the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak 4 examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host ®tness suggest that these viruses do not aect birth and death rates in lions with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus although the endemic viruses fhv and fiv were too prevalent to measure precise health eects there was no evidence that fiv infection reduced host longevity
background an outbreak of leishmaniosis was studied in cats and dogs housed together with no separation in an animal shelter in israel the study included recording of clinical signs serology for leishmania infection by elisa pcr of blood for leishmania dna by its1 hrm and kdna pcr parasite quantification and trapping of sand flies around the shelter results thirty-seven % 22/60 of the dogs and 75% 50/67 of the cats were seropositive to l infantum with a significantly higher seropositivity rate in the cat population χ 2 = 42.160 p < 0.0001 twenty-five percent 15/60 of the dogs were positive for leishmania by blood pcr 12% by the leishmania its1 hrm pcr and 22% by kdna pcr of the cats 16% 11/67 were positive by kdna pcr and none by its1 hrm pcr all the pcr-positive animals were infected by l infantum verified by dna sequencing and there was no significant difference between the pcr-positivity in the dog and cat populations altogether 43% 26/60 of the dogs and 79% 53/67 of the cats were positive by serology or pcr for l infantum the average leishmania parasite load in the blood of pcr-positive dogs 42967 parasites/ml was significantly higher than in pcr-positive cats 1259 parasites/ml t 12 = 2.33 p = 0.037 dogs that were positive by the leishmania its1 hrm pcr and kdna pcr had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kdna pcr t 11 = − 3.186580 p < 0.009 no significant effect was found for fiv seropositivity on leishmania infection in the cats χ 2 = 0.506 p = 0.777 a higher percentage of leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to leishmania-positive cats 100 vs 52.8% χ 2 =15.242 p < 0.0001 phlebotomus perfiliewi a proven vector of l infantum comprised 92% of trapped sand flies comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and l infantum under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats
protective effect of intranasal peste des petits ruminants virus and bacterin vaccinations clinical hematological serological and serum oxidative stress changes in challenged goats veterinary world 12 7 945-950 background and aim the current vaccination for peste des petits ruminants virus pprv is stalled by myriad challenges and continuous endemicity of pneumonia due to fulminant bacterial complication in goats the present study evaluated the protective effect of intranasal pprv linage 1 and bacterine vaccinations twelve west african dwarf wad goats aged 6 months were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of pprv lineage 1 vaccine nig/75 and bacterin from mannheimia haemolytica mh or pasteurella multocida intranasally the goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected wad goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection pi blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants glutathione peroxidase glutathione transferase and superoxide dismutase activities and pro-oxidants malondialdehyde content reduced glutathione hydrogen peroxide generation and myeloperoxidase using spectrophotometric methods data were subjected to parametric statistics at α=0.05 using graphpad prism version 21 results clinically there were pyrexia oculonasal discharge diarrhea anemia leukopenia and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in pprv and bacterin vaccinated goats two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days pi the goats vaccinated with pprv and mh showed better response clinically and biochemically the mucosal vaccination of goats with pprv vaccine and bacterine will protect against exposure and culminate in the development of protective mucosal humoral and cell-mediated immune responses this vaccination strategy will provide framework needed in the prevention and control of endemic caprine pneumonia in nigeria
a selective medium was used to isolate yersinia sp from the intestinal tract of 222 scouring cattle in gippsland during 1985 and 1986 intestinal infection with y pseudotuberculosis particularly of serotype iii was found to be especially prevalent in weaned calves yearlings and young adult cattle clinically affected cattle had a profuse liquid diarrhoea and many were systemically ill haematological changes suggestive of infection were present in 38 of 49 of these cattle at least 35 cattle died and characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 20 of 26 examined histologically y pseudotuberculosis was sensitive to tetracyclines in vitro and this drug produced a rapid bacteriological cure yersiniosis occurred during the winter spring and early summer challenge of adult cattle with y pseudotuberculosis serotype iii did not result in intestinal colonisation or clinical disease intestinal infection was however established in 4 weaned calves and haematological changes and antibody production were demonstrated in them intestinal microabscesses were seen in three calves killed on days 8 14 and 18 after challenge the fourth calf eliminated infection by day 18 and no lesions were demonstrated when it was killed on day 72 there is a very high prevalence of antibodies reacting with y pseudotuberculosis serotype iii in adult cattle it is concluded that cattle are a common host for this bacterium infection being frequent with clinical and fatal disease occurring occasionally the factors leading to clinical disease are unknown aust vet j 6s 271-275
introduction the objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of anti-sarcocystis spp specific igg antibodies in serum samples from precolostral lambs to determine the occurrence of transplacental transmission of sarcocystis spp in sheep methods blood samples were collected from 80 ewes and their respective lambs immediately after lambing and before colostrum ingestion respectively the presence of anti-sarcocystis spp igg was evaluated in serum samples using the indirect fluorescent antibody test ifat positive samples of the lambs were submitted to titration and ifat to detect anti-t gondii and anti-n caninum specific igg results anti-sarcocystis spp igg was detected in 62.5% of the ewes 50/80 and in 4% of the lambs of the seropositive ewes 2/50 none of the lambs from seronegative ewes were positive the final titers of the positive lambs were 80 no cross reaction was detected among the positive samples to anti-sarcocystis spp anti-n caninum and anti-t gondii igg the detection of anti-sarcocystis spp antibodies in serum samples of lambs deprived of colostrum suggests transplacental transmission of infection thus the vertical transmission may be an alternative route of infection of sarcocystis spp also in sheep further studies are warranted to confirm transplacental transmission in sheep and to explain the importance of this infection pathway
intranasal delivery of dna vaccines has become a popular research area recently it offers some distinguished advantages over parenteral and other routes of vaccine administration nasal mucosa as site of vaccine administration can stimulate respiratory mucosal immunity by interacting with the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissues nalt different kinds of dna vaccines are investigated to provide protection against respiratory infectious diseases including tuberculosis coronavirus influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv etc dna vaccines have several attractive development potential such as producing cross-protection towards different virus subtypes enabling the possibility of mass manufacture in a relatively short time and a better safety profile the biggest obstacle to dna vaccines is low immunogenicity one of the approaches to enhance the efficacy of dna vaccine is to improve dna delivery efficiency this review provides insight on the development of intranasal dna vaccine for respiratory infections with special attention paid to the strategies to improve the delivery of dna vaccines using non-viral delivery agents
to cite cresswell e et al a questionnaire-based survey on the uptake and use of cattle vaccines in the uk vet background vaccination is a widely used strategy for disease control in cattle in the uk and abroad however there has been limited research describing the uptake and use of cattle vaccines on uk farms aim to describe the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the uk design a questionnaire available in paper and online format was distributed to cattle farmers by convenience sampling participants all uk cattle farmers were eligible to participate in the study results eighty-six per cent of respondents n=229/266 had vaccinated their cattle in the past year diseases most commonly vaccinated against were bovine viral diarrhoea leptospirosis and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis vaccination compliance was limited in certain areas for example only 48 per cent of respondents stated that they administered the second dose in the primary course within the recommended timeframe and 14 per cent of respondents stated that they vaccinated earlier than the youngest recommended age although outside the scope of this study further work is needed to establish the extent of inadequate compliance and the effect this has on vaccine efficacy the role of the veterinarian was highlighted as the main supplier of vaccines and preferred source of vaccination information respondents preferred to receive recommendations regarding vaccination by faceto-face communication with the veterinarian the results provide a description of the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the uk uptake is generally high but there are areas of usage of vaccines which could be improved upon the veterinarian plays a key role as supplier of vaccines and a source of information for the majority of farmers although outside the scope of this study further work is needed to establish the extent of inadequate compliance and the effect this has on vaccine efficacy although the respondents in this study represent a biased population of farmers the findings indicate areas for future investigation in order to improve vaccination strategies in cattle in the uk cresswell e et al vet rec open 20141e000042
although effective antibody-based vaccines have been developed against multiple viruses such approaches have so far failed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 despite the success of anti-retroviral therapy art that has turned hiv-1 infection into a chronic disease and has reduced the number of new infections worldwide a vaccine against hiv-1 is still urgently needed we discuss here the major reasons for the failure of "classical" vaccine approaches which are mostly due to the biological properties of the virus itself hiv-1 has developed multiple mechanisms of immune escape which also account for vaccine failure so far no vaccine candidate has been able to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs against primary patient viruses from different clades however such antibodies were identified in a subset of patients during chronic infection and were shown to protect from infection in animal models and to reduce viremia in first clinical trials their detailed characterization has guided structure-based reverse vaccinology approaches to design better hiv-1 envelope env immunogens furthermore conserved env epitopes have been identified which are promising candidates in view of clinical applications together with new vector-based technologies considerable progress has been achieved in recent years towards the development of an effective antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine
previously escherichia coli harboring the codon-optimized 3d8scfv gene e coli 3d8scfv was developed as a feed additive for use in preventing norovirus infection here we evaluated whether the 3d8scfv gene affects the colonization of e coli when e coli 3d8scfv passes through the mouse gastrointestinal tract to determine the colonization ability of e coli 3d8scfv e coli cells with or without the 3d8scfv gene were fed to mice total dna was extracted from the animals' stools stomach small intestine and colon all samples were amplified using 3d8scfv gene-specific primer sets e coli 3d8scfv begins to be excreted 1 h after feeding and that all e coli 3d8scfv cells were excreted between 12 and 24 h after the last feeding of the cells the previously measured gastrointestinal transit time of the mice was between 8 h and 22 h the results of this study therefore show that e coli 3d8scfv cannot colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of mice in addition if the purified 3d8 scfv protein is used as a feed additive any associated e coli 3d8scfv bacteria will not colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of the livestock thus this feed additive meets the safety assessment criteria for the commercial use of bacteria
small but valuable class of products since 1985 commercial firms have initiated clinical studies involving a total of 28 mabs to date one product palivizumab has been approved and eight candidates are currently in clinical study most commercial mabs studied as antiviral agents in the clinic have either directly or indirectly targeted human immunodeficiency virus respiratory syncytial virus or hepatitis c virus infections however the ability of mabs to bind to specific targets and utilize various anti-infective modes of action would seem to make them well suited for the prevention and/or treatment of a wider variety of viral diseases a number of factors including the continuing need for innovative medicines for viral infections the global spread of viral infections and increased government funding for the study of pathogen countermeasures have prompted companies to reconsider mabs as antiviral agents public sector research into the use of mabs against emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus may have already provided candidates for further development
the characterization of viral genomes has accelerated due to improvement in dna sequencing technology sources of animal samples and molecular methods for the identification of novel viral pathogens and steps to determine their pathogenicity are listed the difficulties for predicting future cross-species transmissions are highlighted by the wide diversity of known viral zoonoses recent surveys of viruses in wild and domesticated animals have characterized numerous viruses including some closely related to those infecting humans the detection of multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting a single host species phylogenetically interspersed with viruses found in other host species reflects frequent past cross-species transmissions numerous opportunities for the generation of novel vaccines will arise from a better understanding of animal viromes specimens to analyze for new viruses include those from animals with diseases affecting farm productivity and the survival of critically endangered or threatened species the health of animals in zoos and aquariums is also of interest given their high level of care the diverse
the potential effect of the fucose mannose ligand fml-vaccine on immunotherapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis was assayed on five mongrel dogs experimentally infected with leishmania donovani and on 21 leishmania chagasi naturally infected dogs when seropositive to fml but completely asymptomatic the clinical signs of the experimentally infected symptomatic dogs only disappeared after the complete vaccination protection was obtained in 3/5 animals that remained asymptomatic idr positive and parasite free 1 year after infection furthermore the asymptomatic fml-vaccine treated dogs showed stable anti-fml igg1 levels increasing igg2 levels and 79-95% of positive dth response during the whole experiment twenty-two months after complete vaccination no obits due to visceral leishmaniasis were recorded and 90% of these dogs were still asymptomatic healthy and parasite free on the other hand 37% 17/46 dogs kala-azar obits were recorded in a control group that received no treatment during the same period and that was fml-seropositive and asymtpomatic at the beginning of the assay our results indicate that the fml-vaccine was effective in the immunotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis of asymptomatic infected dogs normal proportions of cd4 and cd21 lymphocytes were detected in pbmc by facs analysis in dogs submitted to immunotherapy suggesting their non-infectious condition all animals showed as well significantly increased percents of cd8 lymphocytes as expected for quillaja saponin quila vaccine treatments
colostrum and milk are complex mammary secretions providing the puppy with many nutritional and immunological factors which play a crucial role for its correct development and survival in the case of colostrum and/or milk intake deficiency puppies are at increased risk of infectious diseases this work reviews the various nutritional hyperimmune supplementations proposed to provide a passive immune protection and to positively impact puppies' health some strategies rely on canine immunoglobulins canine colostrum banking and canine serum/plasma supplementation others involve heterologous sources of antibodies and other immune factors bovine colostrum or hyperimmune egg powder among the different solutions evaluated from birth to weaning canine plasma and hyperimmune egg powder showed promising beneficial effect on puppies' health canine plasma seems to positively impact not only growth increased growth during the neonatal period but also digestive health higher species richness of intestinal microbiota and the general health tendency of lower morbidity puppies supplemented with hyperimmune egg powder presented increased neonatal growth and decreased risk of canine parvovirus infection nevertheless natural canine maternal colostrum and milk ingestion remains the optimal guarantee for puppies' health and survival as a source of immunity energy and growth factors
one coronavirus strain was isolated from brain tissues of ten piglets with evident clinical manifestations of vomiting diarrhea and dyskinesia in jilin province in china antigenic and genomic characterizations of the virus isolate phev-jlsp09 were based on multiplex pcr and negative staining electron microscopy and sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin-esterase he gene these piglets were diagnosed with porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev necropsy was performed on the piglets major pathological changes included meningeal hyperemia meningeal hemorrhage and cortical hemorrhage minor changes were also observed in other organs histopathological changes included satellitosis and neuronophagia in the cerebral cortex mice were infected with the isolated virus their histopathological changes were similar to those symptoms observed in the piglets exhibiting typical changes for non-suppurative encephalitis thus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus mainly causes damage to the nervous system but also impacts other organs
since the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak prompted a search for the natural reservoir of the sars coronavirus numerous alpha-and betacoronaviruses have been discovered in bats around the world bats are likely the natural reservoir of alpha-and betacoronaviruses and due to the rich diversity and global distribution of bats the number of bat coronaviruses will likely increase we conducted a surveillance of coronaviruses in bats in an abandoned mineshaft in mojiang county yunnan province china from 2012-2013 six bat species were frequently detected in the cave rhinolophus sinicus rhinolophus affinis hipposideros pomona miniopterus schreibersii miniopterus fuliginosus and miniopterus fuscus by sequencing pcr products of the coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp we found a high frequency of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the mineshaft sequenced partial rdrp fragments had 80%-99% nucleic acid sequence identity with well-characterized alphacoronavirus species including btcov hku2 btcov hku8 and btcov1 and unassigned species btcov hku7 and btcov hku10 additionally the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses one new strain of sars-like coronavirus and one potentially new betacoronavirus species furthermore coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat species a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of novel virus strains our findings highlight the importance of bats as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and the potentially zoonotic source of viral pathogens
the design of optimized nanoparticles offers a promising strategy to enable dna vaccines to cross various physiological barriers for eliciting a specific and protective mucosal immunity via intranasal administration here we reported a new designed nanoparticle system through incorporating anionic liposomes al into chitosan/dna cs/dna complexes with enhanced cellular uptake the constructed al/cs/dna nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries dna vaccine pgja-p/vax into nasal mucosa tem results showed the al/cs/dna had a spherical structure high dna loading ability and effective dna protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis the surface charge of the al/cs/dna depended strongly on ph environment enabling the intracellular release of loaded dna via a ph-mediated manner in comparison to the traditional cs/dna system our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the al/cs/dna at nasal mucosal surface these outstanding features enable the al/cs/dna to induce a significantly p0.01 higher level of secretory iga siga than the cs/dna in animal study and a longer-term mucosal immunity on the other hand the al/cs/dna exhibited minimal cytotoxicity these results suggest that the developed nanoparticles offer a potential platform for dna vaccine packaging and delivery for more efficient elicitation of mucosal immunity
it is essential to understand the latest situation regarding avian coronaviruses acovs commonly referred to as the well-known avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv given that new and diverse types of ibv are continually being identified worldwide particularly ones that are isolated from commercial poultry and associated with a wide range of disease conditions the existing ibvs continue to evolve in various geographic areas in asia which results in the recombination and co-circulation between ibv types this makes it increasingly difficult to prevent and control ibv infections despite routine vaccination some acovs have also been identified in other avian species and they may pose a threat of cross-transmission to commercial sectors the present review provides an overview of ibv circulation and the dynamic emergence of new variants found throughout asia via the recombination of ibv strains in addition to commercial poultry backyard poultry and free-ranging birds may serve as a 'hub' for acov transmission within a particular area these birds may be capable of spreading viruses either to areas of close proximity or to remote places via migration and trade
bat immunity has received increasing attention because some bat species are being decimated by the fungal disease white nose syndrome while other species are potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses identifying specific immune processes requires new specific tools and reagents in this study we describe a new mouse monoclonal antibody mab reactive with eptesicus fuscus immunoglobulins the epitope recognized by mab bt1-4f10 was localized to immunoglobulin light lambda chains hence the mab recognized serum immunoglobulins and b lymphocytes the bt1-4f10 epitope appeared to be restricted to microchiropteran immunoglobulins and absent from megachiropteran immunoglobulins analyses of sera and other e fuscus fluids showed that most if not all secreted immunoglobulins utilized lambda light chains finally mab bt1-4f10 permitted the identification of b cell follicles in splenic white pulp this microchiropteran-specific mab has potential utility in seroassays hence this reagent may have both basic and practical applications for studying immune process
current ebola virus ebov detection methods are costly and impractical for epidemic scenarios different immune-based assays have been reported for the detection and quantification of ebola virus ebov proteins in particular several monoclonal antibodies mabs have been described that bind the capsid glycoprotein gp of ebov gp however the currently available platforms for the design and production of full-length mabs are cumbersome and costly the use of antibody fragments rather than full-length antibodies might represent a cost-effective alternative for the development of diagnostic and possibly even therapeutic alternatives for ebov we report the design and expression of three recombinant anti-gp mab fragments in escherichia coli cultures these fragments contained the heavy and light variable portions of the three well-studied anti-gp full-length mabs 13c6 13f6 and kz52 and are consequently named scfv-13c6 scfv-13f6 and fab-kz52 respectively all three fragments exhibited specific anti-gp binding activity in elisa experiments comparable to that of fulllength anti-gp antibodies i e the same order of magnitude and they are easily and economically produced in bacterial cultures antibody fragments might represent a useful effective and low cost alternative to full-length antibodies in ebola related capture and diagnostics applications
sars-coronavirus sars-cov has recently been identified as the causative agent of sars we constructed a series of recombinant dis rdis a highly attenuated vaccinia strain expressing a gene encoding four structural proteins e m n and s of sars-cov individually or simultaneously these rdis elicited sars-cov-specific serum igg antibody and t-cell responses in vaccinated mice following intranasal or subcutaneous administration mice that were subcutaneously vaccinated with rdis expressing s protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutralizing igg antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in the absence of a mucosal iga response these results indicate that the potent immune response elicited by subcutaneous injection of rdis containing s is able to control mucosal infection by sars-cov thus replication-deficient dis constructs hold promise for the development of a safe and potent sars vaccine
the study evaluated the effect of new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome nnpds on average daily gain adg and mortality and described the clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome nnpds is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life which is not caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec clostridium perfringens c perfringens type a/c clostridium difficile c difficile rotavirus a coronavirus cystoisospora suis strongyloides ransomi giardia spp or cryptosporidium spp results piglets were estimated to have a negative adg of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively however if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth no negative effect on adg was seen piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced adg of 38 g the study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality but herd of origin sow parity birth weight and gender were significantly associated with mortality in one of the herds approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis these findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea conclusions nnpds negatively affected adg in piglets and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in adg however the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect adg and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on adg future research on nnpds probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters the study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds and one herd was considerably more affected than the others within this herd nnpds seemed to be associated with a higher mortality whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of nnpds
the exposure of wild carnivores to viral pathogens with emphasis on parvovirus cpv/fplv was assessed based on the molecular screening of tissue samples from 128 hunted or accidentally road-killed animals collected in portugal from 2008 to 2011 including egyptian mongoose herpestes ichneumon n = 99 red fox vulpes vulpes n = 19 stone marten martes foina n = 3 common genet genetta genetta n = 3 and eurasian badger meles meles n = 4 a high prevalence of parvovirus dna 63% was detected among all surveyed species particularly in mongooses 58% and red foxes 79% along with the presence of cpv/fplv circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-dna positive samples most specimens were extensively autolysed restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation whenever possible to examine signs of active disease were not present supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time pcr possibly correspond to viral dna reminiscent from previous infections the molecular characterization of viruses based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox's as feline panleukopenia virus fplv and one stone marten's as newcpv-2b type the genetic similarity found between the fplv viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in portugal and publicly available comparable sequences suggests a closer genetic relatedness among fplv circulating in portugal although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species such as the wildcat felis silvestris and the critically endangered iberian lynx lynx pardinus
with regard to the effects of various foreign peptides fused to the coat protein subunits on the infectivity of corresponding tmv recombinants some of tmv recombinants were found to induce necrotic local lesions on the inoculated leaves of susceptible tobacco this paper reported that there existed a group of tmv recombinants in which the fused foreign peptides contained a transmembrane domain according to the predictions by three programs of sosui tmpred and das further studies showed for the first time that a foreign transmembrane domain in a fused peptide of the corresponding tmv recombinant would result in the local lesions on the susceptible tobacco leaves in addition it was concluded that none of the tmv recombinants that systematically infected susceptible tobacco contained a transmembrane domain in the coat protein subunits d
community-acquired ca sepsis is a major public health problem worldwide yet the etiology remains unknown for ͼ50% of the patients here we applied metagenomic next-generation sequencing mngs to characterize the human virome in 492 clinical samples 384 sera 92 pooled nasal and throat swabs 10 stools and 6 cerebrospinal fluid samples from 386 patients 213 adults and 173 children presenting with ca sepsis who were recruited from 6 hospitals across vietnam between 2013 and 2015 specific monoplex pcrs were used subsequently to confirm the presence of viral sequences detected by mngs we found sequences related to 47 viral species belonging to 21 families in 358 of 386 93% patients including viruses known to cause human infections after pcr confirmation human viruses were found in 52 of 386 patients 13.4% picornavirus enteroviruses rhinovirus and parechovirus hepatitis b virus n ϭ 10 cytomegalovirus n ϭ 9 epstein-barr virus n ϭ 5 and rotavirus a n ϭ 3 were the most common viruses detected recently discovered viruses were also found gemycircularvirus and wu polyomavirus saffold virus salivirus cyclovirus-vn and human pegivirus 2 adding to the growing literature about the geographic distribution of these novel viruses notably sequences related to numerous viruses not previously reported in human tissues were also detected to summarize we identified 21 viral species known to be infectious to humans in 52 of 386 13.4% patients presenting with ca sepsis of unknown cause the study however cannot directly impute sepsis causation to the viruses identified the results highlight the fact that it remains a challenge to establish the causative agents in ca sepsis patients especially in tropical settings such as vietnam
emergence and re-emergence of respiratory virus infections represent a significant threat to global public health as they occur seasonally and less frequently such as in the case of influenza virus as pandemic infections some of these viruses have been in the human population for centuries and others had recently emerged as a public health problem influenza viruses have been affecting the human population for a long time now however their ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift causes the emergence of new strains a recent example of these events is the avian-origin h7n9 influenza virus outbreak currently undergoing in china human h7n9 influenza viruses are resistant to amantadines and some strains are also resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors greatly limiting the options for treatment respiratory syncytial virus rsv may cause a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by bronchiolitis and pneumonia mainly in children and the elderly infection with rsv can cause severe disease and even death imposing a severe burden for pediatric and geriatric health systems worldwide treatment for rsv is mainly supportive since the only approved therapy a monoclonal antibody is recommended for prophylactic use in high-risk patients the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a newly emerging respiratory virus the virus was first recognized in 2012 and it is associated with a lower respiratory tract disease that is more severe in patients with comorbidities no licensed vaccines or antivirals have been yet approved for the treatment of mers-cov in humans it is clear that the discovery and development of novel antivirals that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to treat these important respiratory viral infections are critical in this review we will describe some of the novel therapeutics currently under development for the treatment of these infections
houldcroft cj and breuer j 2015 tales from the crypt and coral reef the successes and challenges of identifying new herpesviruses using metagenomics herpesviruses are ubiquitous double-stranded dna viruses infecting many animals with the capacity to cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts different herpesviruses have different cell tropisms and have been detected in a diverse range of tissues and sample types metagenomics-encompassing viromics-analyses the nucleic acid of a tissue or other sample in an unbiased manner making few or no prior assumptions about which viruses may be present in a sample this approach has successfully discovered a number of novel herpesviruses furthermore metagenomic analysis can identify herpesviruses with high degrees of sequence divergence from known herpesviruses and does not rely upon culturing large quantities of viral material metagenomics has had success in two areas of herpesvirus sequencing firstly the discovery of novel exogenous and endogenous herpesviruses in primates bats and cnidarians and secondly in characterizing large areas of the genomes of herpesviruses previously only known from small fragments revealing unexpected diversity this review will discuss the successes and challenges of using metagenomics to identify novel herpesviruses and future directions within the field
a cross-sectional study for determining the seroprevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection among swine breeding farms in the castilla y le6n region spain was carried out breeding farms were stratified according to size and type of production intensive or extensive the number of farms to be sampled in each stratum was calculated from the latest census data available and the prevalence of seropositive farms obtained in other countries within each herd the number of sows needed to detect the presence of the disease were sampled according to within-herd seroprevalence data obtained by us in previous studies a total of 5098 sow serum samples from 794 different farms were collected during 1992-1993 and tested for the presence of pedv-specific antibodies using a blocking elisa with monoclonal antibodies 55.9% of herds had at least one positive animal 29.6% of sera were positive seropositive farms were detected throughout the sampled region indicating that the infection was widespread higher farm-level prevalence rates were found in farms with more than 20 sows compared with small ones 120 sows and in intensive than in extensive herds on the other hand within-farm seroprevalence and mean blocking percentage of positive sera decreased with increasing size of the farm
background astroviruses astvs have been reported to infect and cause gastroenteritis in most animal species human astvs were regarded the causative agent of viral diarrhea in children in dogs little is known about the epidemiology and clinical significance of astv infection findings in this study we collected and tested 253 rectal swabs from pet dogs of which 64 samples 25.3% tested positive for astvs with diarrhea and 15 more samples 5.9% also was identified as astvs however without any clinical signs phylogenetic analysis of 39 partial orf1b sequences from these samples revealed that they are similar to astvs which can be subdivided into three lineages interestingly out of the 39 isolates sequenced 16 isolates are shown to be in the mamastrovirus 5/canine astrovirus castv lineage and the remaining 23 isolates displayed higher similarities with known porcine astrovirus poastv 5 and 2 further analysis of 13 capsid sequences from these isolates showed that they are closely clustered with chinese or italy castv isolates the findings indicate that castvs commonly circulate in pet dogs and our sequencing results have shown the genomic diversity of castvs leading to increasing number of clusters
homologous regions strengthens the conclusion that the existence of b regions is meaningful for cvs these comparisons demonstrate that if sequence identity of a and b sequences is needed for some types of rna recombination to occur with the available sequence information recombination would be more favored between nlv strains between lagovirus strains or between feline vesivirus strains than between strains from different hosts within a cv genus or between strains representing different genera genbank accession numbers for the analyzed sequences are hu/nv jiang m87661 hu/nv schreier af093797 hu/ southampton l07418hn/chiba ab042808 hu/lordsdale nc001674 hu/camberwell nc002614 hu/gii clarke x86557 hu gii maryland ay032605 hu/hawaii u07611 bo/jena aj011099 hu/ manchester x86560 po/saif af182760 rhdv meyers m67473 rhdv czech u54983 rhdv iowa 2000 af258618 rhdv rossi x87607 rhdv sd z29514 ebhsv nc002615 fe/f4 d31836 fe/f9 m8679 fe/cfi u] 3992 fe/f65 af]09465 pp/pan-1 af091736 po/a48u76874 and ca/ canine ab070225 abbreviations used include hu = human nv = norwalk virus gll = genogroup ii bo = bovine pc = porcine rhdv = rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus ebhsv = european brown hare syndrome virus fe = feline pp = pan paniscus and ca = canine
background infectious diseases have contributed to the decline and local extinction of several wildlife species including african wild dogs lycaon pictus mitigating such disease threats is challenging partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant often domestic ''reservoir'' hosts and spill over into less abundant host species if this is the case disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate however pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important and may not be controllable by managing another host species methodology/principal findings we investigated interspecific and intraspecific transmission routes by comparing african wild dogs' exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus ehrlichia canis neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens conclusions/significance these findings combined with other data suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus but not from canine distemper virus however further analyses are needed to determine the management approaches -including no intervention -which are most appropriate for each pathogen
background a novel porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov also known as porcine coronavirus hku15 was reported in china in 2012 and identified in the u s in early 2014 since then pdcov has been identified in a number of u s states and linked with clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens since pdcov was just recently linked with clinical disease few specific antibody-based reagents were available to assist in diagnosis of pdcov and limited serological capabilities were available to detect an antibody response to this virus therefore the overall objective of this project was to develop and validate selected diagnostic reagents and assays for pdcov antigen and antibody detection results the nucleoprotein of pdcov was expressed as a recombinant protein and purified for use as an antigen to immunize mice for polyclonal hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibody mab production the resulting mabs were evaluated for use in fluorescent antibody staining methods to detect pdcov infected cells following virus isolation attempts and for immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs the same antigen was used to develop serological tests to detect the antibody response to pdcov in pigs following infection serum samples from swine herds with recent documentation of pdcov infection and samples from expected naïve herds were used for initial assay optimization the tests were optimized in a checkerboard fashion to reduce signal to noise ratios using samples of known status statistical analysis was performed to establish assay cutoff values and assess diagnostic sensitivities and specificities at least 629 known negative serum samples and 311 known positive samples were evaluated for each assay the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa showed diagnostic sensitivity dse of 96.1 % and diagnostic specificity dsp of 96.2 %. the fluorescent microsphere immunoassay fmia showed a dse of 95.8 % and dsp of 98.1 %. both elisa and fmia detected seroconversion of challenged pigs between 8-14 days post-infection dpi an indirect fluorescent antibody ifa test was also developed using cell culture adapted pdcov for comparative purposes
background the spike s protein of sars-cov not only mediates receptor-binding but also induces neutralizing antibodies we previously identified the receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein as a major target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models and thus proposed a rbd-based vaccine however the antigenicity and immunogenicity of rbd in humans need to be characterized results two panels of serum samples from recovered sars patients were included and the antibody responses against the rbd were measured by elisa and micro-neutralization assays we found that the rbd of s protein induced potent antibody responses in the recovered sars patients and rbd-specific antibodies could persist at high titers over three year follow-up furthermore affinity purified anti-rbd antibodies possessed robust neutralizing activity conclusion the rbd of sars-cov is highly immunogenic in humans and mediates protective responses and rbdbased vaccines and diagnostic approaches can be further developed
bats are unique flying mammalians that occur worldwide feeding either on insects fruits or even on blood depending on the species since they are active during the night many myths have been launched during the last 500 years all these facets are shortly considered here and prepare for a hopefully intense look into their hidden life
current progress in the development of vaccines has decreased the incidence of fatal and non-fatal infections and increased longevity however new technologies need to be developed to combat an emerging generation of infectious diseases dna vaccination has been demonstrated to have great potential for use with a wide variety of diseases alone this technology does not generate a significant immune response for vaccination but combined with delivery by electroporation ep can enhance plasmid expression and immunity most ep systems while effective can be invasive and painful making them less desirable for use in vaccination our lab recently developed a non-invasive electrode known as the multi-electrode array mea which lies flat on the surface of the skin without penetrating the tissue in this study we evaluated the mea for its use in dna vaccination using hepatitis b virus as the infectious model we utilized the guinea pig model because their skin is similar in thickness and morphology to humans the plasmid encoding hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag was delivered intradermally with the mea to guinea pig skin the results show increased protein expression resulting from plasmid delivery using the mea as compared to injection alone within 48 hours of treatment there was an influx of cellular infiltrate in experimental groups humoral responses were also increased significantly in both duration and intensity as compared to injection only groups while this electrode requires further study our results suggest that the mea has potential for use in electrically mediated intradermal dna vaccination
influenza viruses have a huge impact on public health current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually and protect poorly against antigenic drift variants or novel emerging subtypes vaccination against influenza can be improved in two important ways either by inducing more broadly protective immune responses or by decreasing the time of vaccine production which is relevant especially during a pandemic outbreak in this review we outline the current efforts to develop so-called "universal influenza vaccines" describing antigens that may induce broadly protective immunity and novel vaccine production platforms that facilitate timely availability of vaccines
despite the availability of antimicrobial agents and vaccines community-acquired pneumonia remains a serious problem severe forms tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly since their immune competence is eroded by immaturity and immune senescence respectively the main etiologic agents differ according to patient age and geographic area streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae respiratory syncytial virus rsv and parainfluenza virus type 3 piv-3 are the most important pathogens in children whereas influenza viruses are the leading cause of fatal pneumonia in the elderly effective vaccines are available against some of these organisms however there are still many agents against which vaccines are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal to tackle this problem empiric approaches are now being systematically replaced by rational vaccine design this is facilitated by the growing knowledge in the fields of immunology microbial pathogenesis and host response to infection as well as by the availability of sophisticated strategies for antigen selection potent immune modulators and efficient antigen delivery systems thus a new generation of vaccines with improved safety and efficacy profiles compared to old and new agents is emerging in this chapter an overview is provided about currently available and new vaccination concepts
a 300-sow farrow-to-finish swine operation in the united states experienced a sudden and severe increase in mortality in neonatal piglets with high morbidity followed by vesicular lesions on the snout and feet of adult females and males affected live piglets were submitted for diagnostic investigation samples tested polymerase chain reaction pcr negative for foot-and-mouth disease virus porcine delta coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus porcine rotavirus types a b and c transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus senecavirus a sv-a formerly known as seneca valley virus was detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr from serum skin and faeces of piglets and from serum and faeces of sows sv-a was isolated in cell culture from piglet samples sv-a vp1 gene region sequencing from piglet tissues was also successful a biosecurity and disease entry evaluation was conducted and identified potential biosecurity risks factors for the entry of new pathogens into the operation this is the first case report in the united states associating sv-a with a clinical course of severe but transient neonatal morbidity and mortality followed by vesicular lesions in breeding stock animals veterinarians and animal caretakers must remain vigilant for vesicular foreign animal diseases and report suspicious clinical signs and lesions to state animal health authorities for diagnostic testing and further investigation
the sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus sars-cov in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins here we assess phylogenetic relationships for the sars-cov lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for sars-cov and other coronaviruses we used a bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three sars-cov proteins rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp nucleocapsid n and spike s conservation of rdrp allowed us to use a set of arteriviridae taxa to root the coronaviridae phylogeny we found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within sars-cov rdrp based on different well supported trees for a 5 fragment supporting sars-cov as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses and a 3 fragment supporting sars-cov as sister to group three avian coronaviruses these different topologies are statistically significant the optimal 5 tree could be rejected for the 3 region and the optimal 3 tree could be rejected for the 5 region we did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of n and s as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and sars-cov based on n showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously however current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat chicken and turkey mammals and manx shearwater and humans and other mammals the sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3 rdrp fragment of sars-cov suggests an additional host-species shift demonstration of recombination in the sars-cov lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development
virulence factors produced by a pathogen are essential for causing disease in the host they enable the pathogen to establish itself within the host thus enhancing its potential to cause disease and in some instances underlie evasion of host defense mechanisms identifi cation of these molecules especially those of immunological interest and their use in vaccine development are attractive and are among the initial steps of reverse vaccinology surface localized virulence factors such as adhesins serve as excellent immunogenic candidates in this regard in this chapter we have described the bioinformatics approaches for adhesin prediction which include specifi c adhesin prediction algorithms
considering recent hiv vaccine failures the authors believe that it would be most important to find new targets for vaccine-induced immunity and to analyze the data from previous trials using an innovative approach in their review article the authors briefly summarize the significance of the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in different viral diseases and discuss role of these types of antibodies as the obstacles for vaccine development findings which indicate that complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement c-ade is present also in hiv-infected patients are summarized previous results of the authors suggesting that c-ade plays a very important role in the progression of hiv infection are described data reflecting that enhancing antibodies may develop even in vaccinated animals and human volunteers and may be responsible for the paradoxical results obtained in some subgroups of vaccinees are discussed finally based on their hypothesis the authors offer some suggestions for the future development of vaccines
an outbreak of exudative epidermitis ee among piglets in a swedish spf-herd initiated a survey for indications as to the cause of disease the herd was established by caesarean section and has been closed to all new animal material with the exception of semen for arti®cial insemination ai the study comprised serum samples from the spf-herd over a 10-year period n 109 and a close monitoring of animals in the herd during the period after the ee outbreak serum samples from conventional boars at the ai-station servicing the herd were also included n 9 all serum samples were tested for antibodies to porcine circovirus-2 pcv-2 in addition 3-week-old piglets from three litters n 24 farrowed close after the initial ee outbreak were closely monitored for clinical signs of skin disease sampled for staphylococcus hyicus tested for antibodies to porcine parvovirus and in sequentially collected serum samples tested for interferon-a ifn-a and interleukin-6 the pvc-2 serology showed that animals in the herd were sero-negative at least until 2 months prior to the ee outbreak during the period close after the ee outbreak the animals showed varying levels of antibodies to pcv-2 but all the tested animals had sero-converted 4 months later the ai boars were also sero-positive to pcv-2 at the time of the ee outbreak animals in the spf-herd remained sero-positive to pcv-2 during the following 7 years in the monitored litters one piglet had clinical ee and 15 piglets displayed de®ned erythemas on the abdomen fourteen of the piglets also had ifn-a in serum on one or more occasions during the study indicating viral activity among the animals s hyicus was isolated from all of the piglets from the earliest sampling point 3 days of age veterinary microbiology 86 2002 281±293 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 -x and onwards irrespective of clinical signs pcv-2 was isolated from lymphnode tissue collected from one of the ee affected pigs further increases in the number of stillborn piglets small litters <6 piglets and repeat breeders could be correlated to the time of pcv-2 sero-conversion coincidence of active viral infection and sero-conversion to pcv-2 points to the virus as the cause of the ee outbreak and reproductive disturbances #
the major concern for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov is the lack of diagnostic and therapeutic agents using a phage display technology in a chicken system high-affinity monoclonal antibody fragments against the sars-cov spike protein were characterized ten truncated spike protein gene fragments were expressed in escherichia coli cells following the immunization of chickens with these recombinant spike proteins two single-chain variable fragment scfv antibody libraries were established with short or long linkers to contain 5 × 10 7 and 9 × 10 6 transformants respectively after four rounds of panning selection the scfv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were demonstrated by coomassie blue staining and verified by western blot analysis in a comparison of nucleotide sequences with the chicken germline gene we found that all clones varied in the complementarity-determining regions that two scfv antibodies reacted significantly with sars-cov-infected vero cells and that those two specific scfv antibodies recognized the same region of the spike protein spanning amino acid residues 750-1000 in conclusion the results suggest that the chicken scfv phage display system can be a potential model for mass production of high-affinity antibodies against the sars-cov spike protein
one hypothesis for the etiology of central nervous system cns autoimmune disease is that infection by a virus sharing antigenic epitopes with cns antigens molecular mimicry elicits a virus-specific immune response that also recognizes self-epitopes to address this hypothesis transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv as self in oligodendrocytes intraperitoneal infection with lcmv strain armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the cns and the virus was cleared within 7-14 d after clearance a chronic inflammation of the cns resulted accompanied by upregulation of cns expression of mhc class i and ii molecules a second lcmv infection led to enhanced cns pathology characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated lcmv-specific memory t cells these findings indicate that chronic cns autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus these results may explain the association of several different viruses with some human autoimmune diseases
objective to describe ocular findings in kittens with congenital or early neonatal infection by toxoplasma gondii and to determine if there are detectable differences in disease caused by three strains animals studied six adult female cats and the offspring from seven litters methods four kittens from uninfected specific pathogen-free spf queens and 21 kittens from spf queens inoculated at various times late in gestation with mozart maggie or me-49 strain of t gondii were used ocular examinations were performed on queens prior to and after delivery and on kittens weekly to bi-weekly for up to 27 weeks whole blood for serology was collected from all kittens at 5 1 / 2 to 8 weeks of age and again at 12 weeks of age or later results no kittens from noninfected queens developed ocular lesions or antibody to t gondii . three of the 24 kittens from infected queens died or were euthanized early in the study chorioretinitis was detected in 15 of 21 living kittens from infected queens two developed concurrent anterior uveitis that resolved within 1 week posterior segment lesions varied ophthalmoscopically between strains of 21 kittens from t gondiiinfected queens six developed positive antibody titers to t gondii during the study all seropositive kittens were born to queens infected with mozart strain of t gondii . conclusion results of this study suggest that ocular toxoplasmosis can occur without other evidence of clinical illness in kittens infected in utero or in the neonatal period and that t gondii strains may have varying degrees of ocular pathogenicity in cats

bat-borne viral diseases are a major public health concern among newly emerging infectious diseases which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome nipah marburg and ebola virus disease during the survey for nipah virus among bats at north-east region of india tioman virus tiov a new member of the paramyxoviridae family was isolated from tissues of pteropus giganteus bats for the first time in india this isolate was identified and confirmed by rt-pcr sequence analysis and electron microscopy a range of vertebrate cell lines were shown to be susceptible to tioman virus negative electron microscopy study revealed the "herringbone" morphology of the nucleocapsid filaments and enveloped particles with distinct envelope projections a characteristic of the paramyxoviridae family sequence analysis of nucleocapsid gene of tiov demonstrated sequence identity of 99.87% and 99.99% nucleotide and amino acid respectively with of tiov strain isolated in malaysia 2001 this report demonstrates the first isolation of tioman virus from a region where nipah virus activity has been noticed in the past and recent years bat-borne viruses have become serious concern world-wide a survey of bats for novel viruses in this region would help in recognizing emerging viruses and combating diseases caused by them
the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv spike s protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies against pedv here immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of pedv were identified using a panel of s-specific monoclonal antibodies mabs ten of eleven s-specific mabs successfully neutralized pedv infectivity in vitro notably epitope mapping by peptide elisas revealed that nine of these mabs recognized linear neutralizing epitopes located in the n-terminus of the s2 glycoprotein subunit amino acids 744-759 747-774 and/or 756-771 additionally one mab recognized a neutralizing epitope located in the c-terminus of s2 aa 1371-1377 while only one neutralizing mab reacted against a region of the s1 glycoprotein subunit aa 499-600 notably mabs that recognized epitopes within the s2 subunit presented the highest neutralizing activity against pedv together these results indicate that the s2 glycoprotein subunit contains major antigenic determinants and perhaps the immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of pedv
a b s t r a c t prrsv is the causative agent of the most important infectious disease affecting swine herds worldwide producing great economic losses commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against prrsv moreover modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding and could revert generating virulent phenotypes therefore new efficient vaccines are required vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes virus vectored vaccines against prrsv could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines in this paper current vectored vaccines to protect against prrsv are revised including those based on pseudorabies virus poxvirus adenovirus and virus replicons special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev as vector for the expression of prrsv antigens this vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes is a potent interferon-␣ inducer and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity a tgev derived vector rtgev was generated expressing prrsv wild type or modified gp5 and m proteins described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response respectively protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones partial protection in challenged animals was observed as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones nevertheless the level of neutralizing antibodies was low what may explain the limited protection observed several strategies are proposed to improve current rtgev vectors expressing prrsv antigens
the 1918 spanish flu virus has claimed more than 50 million lives however the mechanism of its high pathogenicity remains elusive and the origin of the virus is controversial the matrix m segment regulates the replication of influenza a virus thereby affecting its virulence and pathogenicity this study found that the m segment of the spanish flu virus is a recombinant chimera originating from avian influenza virus and human influenza virus the unique mosaic m segment might confer the virus high replication capacity showing that the recombination might play an important role in inducing high pathogenicity of the virus in addition this study also suggested that the na and ns segments of the virus were generated by reassortment between mammalian and avian viruses direct phylogenetic evidence was also provided for its avian origin
the panel of laboratory tests available for diagnosis of gastrointestinal gi diseases in dogs and cats is wide and recently several new tests have been developed this article will focus on advances in laboratory tests that are available for the general practitioner for diagnosis of gi diseases laboratory tests for diagnosis of gastric and intestinal infectious diseases include fecal parasite screening tests enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for parvoviral enteritis and some specific bacterial tests like fluorescent in situ hybridization for identification of specific bacteria attached to the intestinal epithelial cells serum concentrations of folate and cobalamin are markers of intestinal absorption but are also changed in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal bacterial overgrowth hypocobalaminemia is common in gi and pancreatic disease decreased serum trypsinlike immunoreactivity is a very sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs and cats serum pancreatic lipase is currently the most sensitive and specific test to identify pancreatic cell damage and acute pancreatitis however serum canine pancreas-specific lipase is less sensitive in canine chronic pancreatitis increased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity is also specific for pancreatic damage but is less sensitive it is very likely that further studies will help to better specify the role of these new tests in the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatic diseases
background the feline endogenous retrovirus rd114 is contained in the genome of cats the virus may contaminate live canine vaccines based on cultured feline cells the in vivo infectivity acute and subacute pathogenicity and viral proliferation of the rd114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs methods nine specific pathogen free dogs were divided into three groups with each group consisting of one female and two male dogs dogs were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with either 1 ml rd114 stock virus group a inactivated rd114 virus suspension group b or cell culture medium group c as a negative control to assess blood cell counts and biochemical properties blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation just prior to inoculation and 1 3 7 and 10 days post-inoculation result during the experimental period of 51 days none of the dogs inoculated with rd114 virus showed any clinical signs significant increases in rectal temperature or abnormal blood biochemical characteristics including c-reactive protein when compared with the negative controls we were not able to re-isolate the rd114 virus from buffy coat cells of group a dogs additionally we could not detect rd114 provirus in the genomic dna isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes lymph node spleen and sternal bone marrow cells conclusions signs of rd114 virus proliferation were not found after subcutaneous infection of dogs although the potential risk caused by infection with rd114 virus in dogs could not be assessed in this study we suspect that rd114 virus has little or no virulence in dogs
duckweeds are small floating aquatic plants with a number of useful characteristics including edibility fastgrowing and a clonal proliferation duckweed is also fed to animals as a diet complement because of its high nutritional value porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a major causative agent of fatal diarrhea in piglets and is a serious problem in the hog-raising industry in this study we assessed the feasibility of producing a protective antigen for the pedv spike protein 1 using duckweed lemna minor stably transformed lemna were obtained by co-cultivation with a tumefaciens eha105 harboring the pedv spike protein gene transgene integration and expression of the pedv spike protein 1 gene were confirmed by genomic pcr and rt-pcr and western blot analysis of transgenic lemna respectively this is the first report of the expression of a vaccine antigen against an animal infectious disease in duckweed additional key words aquatic plant porcine diarrhea spike protein transformation vaccine hort environ biotechnol 525511-515 2011
background bovine coronavirus is a primary cause of neonatal calf diarrhea worldwide and is also associated with acute diarrhea in adult cattle during the winter season there are no reports on molecular characterization of bovine coronavirus in ireland and little data exists apart from serological studies findings in this study 11 neonatal mean age 9 days calf bcov strains from the south of ireland were collected over a one year period and characterized using molecular methods the spike gene which encodes a protein involved in viral entry infectivity and immune response shows the most variability amongst the isolates and was subsequently selected for in depth analysis phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene revealed that the irish strains clustered with novel bcov strains from europe in a unique clade possibly indicating lineage partitioning direct analysis of alignments identified amino acid changes in the spike protein unique to the irish clade conclusion thus monitoring of bovine coronavirus in ireland is important as the current isolates in circulation in the south of ireland may be diverging from the available vaccine strain which may have implications regarding future bcov vaccine efficacy
canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 the aetiological agent of haemorrhagic enteritis in dogs includes three antigenic variants types 2a 2b and 2c cpv-2c has been detected initially in italy and subsequently in vietnam we report the first identification of this novel antigenic variant in spain where it caused an outbreak of fatal enteritis in basset hound pups in association with canine coronavirus type i and type ii we suggest that this new antigenic variant of cpv-2 could spread throughout europe and that there is a subsequent need to update current cpv vaccines u s
purpose of review this review highlights some of the recent concerning emerging infectious diseases a number of them specifically that the world health organization has categorized as priorities for research recent findings emerging and reemerging infectious diseases account for significant losses in not only human life but also financially there are a number of contributing factors most commonly surrounding human behavior that lead to disease emergence zoonoses are the most common type of infection specifically from viral pathogens the most recent emerging diseases in the usa are emergomyces canadensis the heartland virus and the bourbon virus summary in addition to the aforementioned pathogens the severe acute respiratory syndrome middle east respiratory syndrome nipah virus new delhi metallo-ß-lactamase-1 enterobacteriaceae rift valley fever virus and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus are reviewed these pathogens are very concerning with a high risk for potential epidemic ultimately causing both significant mortality and financial costs research should be focused on monitoring prevention and treatment of these diseases
traditional vaccines against viruses are designed to target their surface proteins i e antigens which can trigger the immune system to produce specific antibodies to capture and neutralize the viruses however viruses often evolve quickly and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies antigenic drift this limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the t-cell mediated immunity which is able to recognize conserved viral hla peptides presented on virus-infected cells thus by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus t-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of t-cell epitopes based on the hla alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person specifically our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then predicts hla peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to trigger responses from the person's t cells we applied the workflow to identify t-cell epitopes for the sars-cov-2 virus which has caused the recent covid-19 pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe

bovine herpesvirus 1 bhv1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 bvd2 are endemic in india although no mixed infection with these viruses has been reported from india we report first mixed infection of these viruses in cattle during routine screening with a microarray chip 62 of the 69 probes of bhv1 and 42 of the 57 bvd2 probes in the chip gave positive signals for the virus the virus infections were subsequently confirmed by rt-pcr we also discuss the implications of these findings
a group of 23 student volunteers were each inoculated intranasally with 400 iu of inactivated freeze-dried a/england/42/72 vaccine 0nly one volunteer showed a four-fold rise in serum hi antibody following immunization and the mean increase in serum hi antibody gmt for all volunteers did not increase two-fold thirteen of the volunteers developed detectable levels of nasal wash neutralizing antibody after immunization local antibody was most commonly found in volunteers who also produced a detectable but less than four-fold rise in serum antibody titre and who produced nasal washings with relatively high concentrations of protein and secretory iga four weeks after immunization the vaccinees and a matched group of control subjects were inoculated with attenuated a/england/ 42/72 mrc-7 virus evidence of infection was found in 14 of 23 61 per cent of control subjects and in seven of 23 30 per cent of immunized volunteers this result showed a significant protection p-0.04 against challenge virus infection for volunteers given intranasal vaccine
recently we reported the discovery of a dromedary camel coronavirus uae-hku23 dccov uae-hku23 from dromedaries in the middle east in this study dccov uae-hku23 was successfully isolated in two of the 14 dromedary fecal samples using hrt-18g cells with cytopathic effects observed five days after inoculation northern blot analysis revealed at least seven distinct rna species corresponding to predicted subgenomic mrnas and confirming the core sequence of transcription regulatory sequence motifs as 5 1 -ucuaaac-3 1 as we predicted previously antibodies against dccov uae-hku23 were detected in 58 98.3% and 59 100% of the 59 dromedary sera by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody tests respectively there was significant correlation between the antibody titers determined by immunofluorescence and neutralization assays pearson coefficient = 0.525 p < 0.0001 immunization of mice using recombinant n proteins of dccov uae-hku23 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov respectively and heat-inactivated dccov uae-hku23 showed minimal cross-antigenicity between dccov uae-hku23 and mers-cov by western blot and neutralization antibody assays codon usage and genetic distance analysis of rdrp s and n genes showed that the 14 strains of dccov uae-hku23 formed a distinct cluster separated from those of other closely related members of betacoronavirus 1 including alpaca cov confirming that dccov uae-hku23 is a novel member of betacoronavirus 1
highly pathogenic avian influenza a hpai h5n1 viruses are circulating among poultry populations in parts of asia africa and the middle east and have caused human infections with a high mortality rate h5 subtype hemagglutinin ha has evolved into phylogenetically distinct clades and subclades based on viruses isolated from various avian species since 1997 humans have been infected by hpai h5n1 viruses from several clades it is therefore important to develop strategies to produce protective antibody responses against h5n1 viruses from multiple clades or antigenic groups in the current study we optimized the signal peptide design of dna vaccines expressing ha antigens from h5n1 viruses cross reactivity analysis using sera from immunized rabbits showed that antibody responses elicited by a polyvalent formulation including ha antigens from different clades was able to elicit broad protective antibody responses against multiple key representative h5n1 viruses across different clades data presented in this report support the development of a polyvalent dna vaccine strategy against the threat of a potential h5n1 influenza pandemic
background human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 is a recently identified coronavirus with a global distribution and known to cause mainly respiratory infections objectives to investigate the seroepidemiology of hku1 infections in our local population study design an elisa-based igg antibody detection assay using recombinant hcov-hku1 nucleocapsid and spike s proteins genotype a were developed for the diagnosis of cov-hku1 infections additionally a neutralization antibody assay using the hcov-hku1 pseudotyped virus was developed to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum with antibody positivity in an s protein-based elisa results results of the recombinant s protein-based elisa were validated with western blot immunofluorescence analysis and flow cytometry the coupled results demonstrated good correlation with spearmen's coefficient of 0.94 seroepidemiological study in a local hospital-based setting using this newly developed elisa showed steadily increasing hcov-hku1 seroprevalence in childhood and early adulthood from 0% in the age group of <10 years old to a plateau of 21.6% in the age group of 31-40 years old conclusions our study demonstrated the usefulness of the s-based elisa which could be applied to future epidemiological studies of hcov-hku1 in other localities
background dna vaccines have emerged as attractive candidates for the control of human papillomavirus hpvassociated malignancies however dna vaccines suffer from limited immunogenicity and thus strategies to enhance dna vaccine potency are needed we have previously demonstrated that for dna vaccines encoding hpv-16 e7 antigen crt/e7 linkage with calreticulin crt linked enhances both the e7-specific cd8 + t cell immune responses and antitumor effects against e7-expressing tumors in the current study we aim to introduce an approach to elicit potent cd4 + t cell help for the enhancement of antigen-specific cd8 + t cell immune responses generated by crt/e7 dna vaccination by using co-administration of a dna vector expressing papillomavirus major and minor capsid antigens l1 and l2 result we showed that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus type 1 bpv-1 l1 and l2 in combination with dna vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific cd8 + in both crt/e7 and ovalbumin ova antigenic systems we also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors expressing bpv-1 l1 and/or l2 dna with crt/e7 dna led to the generation of l1/l2-specific cd4 + t cell immune responses and l1-specific neutralizing antibodies furthermore we showed that co-administration with dna encoding bpv1 l1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by crt/e7 dna vaccination in addition the observed enhancement of cd8 + t cell immune responses by dna encoding l1 and l2 was also found to extend to hpv-16 l1/l2 system our strategy elicits both potent neutralizing antibody and therapeutic responses and may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems beyond papillomavirus for the control of infection and/or cancer
american countries where it is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of acute febrile illness the hallmark of mayv infection is a highly debilitating and chronic arthralgia although mayv emergence is a potential threat there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine in this study we developed a murine model of mayv infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated mayv vaccine candidate mayv/ires intraplantar inoculation of a wt strain of mayv into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception transient viral replication in target organs systemic production of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and specific humoral igm and igg responses inoculation of mayv/ires in balb/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses moreover mayv/ ires vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt mayv strain thus this study describes a novel model of mayv infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated mayv vaccine candidate in host's protection from disease induced by a virulent mayv strain
the development of countermeasures to prevent and treat covid-19 is a global health priority in under 7 weeks we enrolled a cohort of sars-cov-2-recovered participants developed neutralization assays to interrogate serum and monoclonal antibody responses adapted our high throughput antibody isolation production and characterization pipeline to rapidly screen over 1000 antigen-specific antibodies and established an animal model to test protection we report multiple highly potent neutralizing antibodies nabs and show that passive transfer of a nab provides protection against highdose sars-cov-2 challenge in syrian hamsters the study suggests a role for nabs in prophylaxis and potentially therapy of covid-19 the nabs define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design
hendra and nipah viruses family paramyxoviridae genus henipavirus are zoonotic rna viruses that cause lethal disease in humans and are designated as biosafety level 4 bsl4 agents moreover henipaviruses belong to the same group of viruses that cause disease more commonly in humans such as measles mumps and respiratory syncytial virus due to the relatively recent emergence of the henipaviruses and the practical constraints of performing functional genomics studies at high levels of containment our understanding of the henipavirus infection cycle is incomplete in this chapter we describe recent loss-of-function i e rnai functional genomics screens that shed light on the henipavirus-host interface at a genome-wide level further to this we cross-reference rnai results with studies probing host proteins targeted by henipavirus proteins such as nuclear proteins and immune modulators these functional genomics studies join a growing body of evidence demonstrating that nuclear and nucleolar host proteins play a crucial role in henipavirus infection furthermore these studies will underpin future efforts to define the role of nucleolar host-virus interactions in infection and disease
a clear understanding of immunity in individuals infected with influenza virus is critical for the design of effective vaccination and treatment strategies whereas myriad studies have teased apart innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza infection in murine models much less is known about human immunity as a result of the ethical and technical constraints of human research still these murine studies have provided important insights into the critical correlates of protection and pathogenicity in human infection and helped direct the human studies that have been conducted here we examine and review the current literature on immunity in humans infected with influenza virus noting evidence offered by select murine studies and suggesting directions in which future research is most warranted j leukoc biol 92 83-96 2012
all vascular plant species were listed on eight sites near sydney australia four sites were on infertile and four on fertile soil each of the 335 species was classified according to seed mass measured as fresh mass of embryo plus endosperm morphological adaptations for dispersal by different vectors and growth form the infertile-soil sites had more species and more cover adapted for dispersal by ants and the fertile-soil sites had more species and more cover with fleshy fruits adapted for dispersal by vertebrates we tested the hypothesis that this difference could be interpreted as a secondary correlate of seed size or of growth form species with smaller seed mass or growing to <2 m tall were significantly more likely to be adapted for dispersal by ants relative to vertebrates an indirect association via growth form was capable of accounting for up to 84% of the relationship between soil type and dispersal mode an indirect association via seed mass for up to 23% of the relationship the two together could account for a maximum of 85%. the indirect association via seed mass was relatively weaker because seed masses proved not to be very different between these soil types there remained a significant residual t~ndency for species in any given seed size class and growth form to be more likely to be dispersed by vertebrates relative to ants on fertile soils than on infertile soils
polymorphisms in the interferon lambda gene locus ifnl such as the ifnl4 genetic variants rs12979860 and rs368234815 are predictive of resolution of hepatitis c virus infection but information about the impact of these variants in other infections is scarce this study aimed at determining the potential impact of ifnl4 variation for the clearance of respiratory tract pathogens in rwandan children ≤5 years old n = 480 seeking medical care for acute respiratory infections nasopharyngeal swabs were retrieved from all children at the first hospital referral and from 161 children at follow-up visits 2 weeks later the swabs were analyzed for pathogens by real-time pcr and for host cell ifnl4 genotype at rs12979860 and rs368234815 approximately 1/3 of the children were homozygous for the rs12979860 t allele and the rs368234815 g allele which are overrepresented in subjects of african descent these ifnl4 variants were significantly associated with reduced clearance of rna viruses our results suggest that ifnl4 genotypes that are common among subjects of african descent may determine inefficacious clearance of rna viruses from the respiratory tract
several new human monoclonal antibodies mabs with a neutralizing potential across different subtypes have recently been described three mabs hj16 hgn194 and hk20 were obtained from patients within the hiv-1 cohort of the institute of tropical medicine itm our aim was to generate immunization antibodies equivalent to those seen in plasma here we describe the selection and characterization of patient plasma and their mabs using a range of neutralization assays including several peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmc based assays and replicating primary viruses as well as cell line based assays and pseudoviruses pv the principal criterion for selection of patient plasma was the activity in an 'extended incubation phase' pbmc assay neutralizing abs derived from their memory b cells were then selected by elisa with envelope proteins as solid phase mabs were subsequently tested in a high-throughput hos-pv assay to assess functional neutralization the present study indicates that the strong profiles in the patients' plasma were not solely due to antibodies represented by the newly isolated mabs although results from the various assays were divergent they by and large indicate that neutralizing abs to other epitopes of the hiv-1 envelope are present in the plasma and synergy between abs may be important thus the spectrum of the obtained mabs does not cover the range of cross-reactivity seen in plasma in these carefully selected patients irrespective of which neutralization assay is used nevertheless these mabs are relevant for immunogen discovery because they bind to the recombinant glycoproteins to which the immune response needs to be targeted in vivo our observations illustrate the remaining challenges required for successful immunogen design and development
the recent introduction of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv into the north american swine herd has highlighted again the need for effective vaccines for swine coronaviruses while vaccines for transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev have been available to producers around the world for a long time effective vaccines for pedv and deltacoronaviruses were only recently developed or are still in development here we review existing vaccine technologies for swine coronaviruses and highlight promising technologies which may help to control these important viruses in the future
sapoviruses savs within the caliciviridae family are an important cause of gastroenteritis in both humans and animals although the widespread occurrence of divergent human sav strains has been reported there have only been a few studies of porcine savs examining their genetic diversity the aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of porcine savs in piglets with diarrhea in south korea two hundred and thirty-seven fecal specimens from piglets with diarrhea were examined from 78 farms over a 2-year period from six provinces in south korea overall 69 29.1% of the samples from five provinces tested positive for porcine savs by either rt-pcr or nested pcr with the primer pairs specific to porcine savs an analysis of the partial capsid gene 757 bp of 12 porcine savs detected from fecal samples showed genetic divergence not only among the korean porcine savs 67.7-99.1% but also between korean and american porcine savs 69.1-90.2%. interestingly one strain po/sav/jn-ma113/05/korea formed a second porcine sav/giii genotype and is tentatively called giii/2 this strain had a 0.236-0.405 inter-cluster distance with the other strains in the same genogroup which is comparable to the distances between the established gi and gii savs furthermore two potential recombinant porcine savs were identified in conclusion porcine sav infections are common in diarrheic piglets in south korea the infecting strains are genetically diverse and include a newly recognized genotype and recombinant viruses within genogroup iii #
introduction neonates are less responsive to vaccines than adults making it harder to protect newborns against infection neonatal differences in antigen-presenting cell b and t cell function all likely contribute a key question is whether novel adjuvants might be able to make neonatal vaccines more effective areas covered this review addresses the issues of how to improve neonatal vaccines which we have defined as vaccines given in the first 4 weeks of life in a human infant or the first week of life in a mouse a search was performed using keywords including 'neonatal immunity' 'neonatal immunisation' 'vaccine' and 'adjuvant' of pubmed articles published between 1960 and 2018 expert opinion sugar-like structures have recently been shown to prime the infant adaptive immune system to respond to vaccines being potentially more effective than traditional adjuvants sugar-based compounds with beneficial adjuvant effects in neonatal vaccine models include delta inulin advax curdlan and trehalose 66ʹ-dibehenate such compounds make interesting neonatal adjuvant candidates either used alone or in combination with traditional innate immune adjuvants article history
norovirus is the most common cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and is a burden worldwide the increasing norovirus diversity is currently categorized into at least 10 genogroups which are further classified into more than 40 genotypes in addition to humans norovirus can infect a broad range of hosts including livestock pets and wild animals e g marine mammals and bats little is known about norovirus infections in most non-human hosts but the close genetic relatedness between some animal and human noroviruses coupled with lack of understanding where newly appearing human norovirus genotypes and variants are emerging from has led to the hypothesis that norovirus may not be host restricted and might be able to jump the species barrier we have systematically reviewed the literature to describe the diversity prevalence and geographic distribution of noroviruses found in animals and the pathology associated with infection we further discuss the evidence that exists for or against interspecies transmission including surveillance data and data from in vitro and in vivo experiments
the maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in african forest ecosystems are still unknown but indirect evidences point at the involvement of some bat species despite intense research the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet the alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including or not several bat and other species deserves more investigation however african forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts how does one puzzle out since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts under this constraint and given the peculiar ecology of bats roosting behaviour habitat utilisation and flight mode we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses in contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats and that the alternative maintenance host if it exists must be amongst them a list of these pathways is provided along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses in conclusion taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats ebvs are zoonotic pathogens several ebv species in africa have spilled over into human populations several times from animals to humans with primary cases confirmed or suspected occurring close or within forest habitats and often after close contacts e g hunting transport eating between humans and forest wild species including duikers monkeys and great apes . the disease ecology of ebv is therefore multi-hosts and deeply entrenched at human/wildlife interfaces within forest ecosystems there is a need to understand what constitutes the maintenance of ebv that could differ from one ebv species to another namely a maintenance host or a maintenance community i e several species in interaction within specific forest ecosystems understanding how this maintenance system works could help in predicting and preventing future outbreaks here we briefly present current and discuss alternative hypotheses in order to provide insight into different avenues of investigation we will focus on the disease ecology of the zaire ebolavirus ebov for simplicity but most of the following hypotheses apply to the other african ebvs
around 200 million people suffer gastroenteritis daily and more than 2 million people die annually in developing countries due to such pathologies vaccination is an alternative to control this global health issue however new low-cost vaccines are needed to ensure proper vaccine coverage in this context plants are attractive hosts for the synthesis and delivery of subunit vaccines therefore in this study a plant-made multiepitopic protein named ltbentero containing epitopes from antigens of enterotoxigenic e coli s typhimurium and v parahaemolyticus was produced and found immunogenic in mice the ltbentero protein was expressed in tobacco plants at up to 5.29 µg g −1 fresh leaf tissue and was deemed immunogenic when administered to balb/c mice either orally or subcutaneously the plant-made ltbentero antigen induced specific igg systemic and iga mucosal responses against ltb st and lptd epitopes in conclusion multiepitopic ltbentero was functionally produced in plant cells being capable to trigger systemic and intestinal humoral responses and thus it constitutes a promising oral immunogen candidate in the fight against enteric diseases publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
manure application is a source of pathogens to the environment through overland runoff and tile drainage zoonotic pathogens can contaminate surface water and streambed sediment and could affect both wildlife and human health this study examined the environmental occurrence of gene markers for livestock-related bacterial protozoan and viral pathogens and antibiotic resistance in surface waters within the south fork iowa river basin before and after periods of swine manure application on agricultural land increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding iowa's state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health additionally the occurrence of hev and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for escherichia coli enterococcus spp salmonella sp and staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment during this study several zoonotic pathogens were detected including shiga-toxin producing e coli campylobacter jejuni pathogenic enterococci and s aureus all of which can pose mild to serious health risks to swine humans and other wildlife this research provides the foundational understanding required for future assessment of the risk to environmental health from livestock-related zoonotic pathogen exposures in this j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / s c i t o t e n v region this information could also be important for maintaining swine herd biosecurity and protecting the health of wildlife near swine facilities published by elsevier b v
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a zoonotic betacoronavirus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe acute respiratory disease as of july 28 2017 there have been 2040 confirmed cases with 712 reported deaths while many infections have been fatal there have also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through monitoring and contact tracing new zealand white rabbits are a possible model for asymptomatic infection with mers-cov in order to discover more about non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with mers-cov would protect against reinfection we inoculated rabbits with mers-cov and monitored the antibody and inflammatory response following intranasal infection rabbits developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high levels of viral rna viral antigen and perivascular inflammation in multiple lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs the rabbits developed antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the animals were not protected from reinfection in fact reinfection resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation without an associated increase in viral rna titers interestingly passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits to naïve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection we further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of complement proteins compared to primary infection however reinfection elicited neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to mers-cov who fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response or persons whose neutralizing antibody titers have waned may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure to mers-cov plos pathogens | https//doi new zealand white rabbits display an increase in lung inflammation following reinfection with mers-cov that is associated with non-neutralizing antibodies and complement proteins the development of neutralizing antibodies resulted in protection from infection these findings may have implications for individuals that fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response or for those whose response wanes over time upon re-exposure to mers-cov enhanced inflammation after mers reinfection in rabbits plos pathogens | https//doi org/10.1371/journal ppat.1006565 august 17 2017 2 / 25 competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist fig 1 schematic of rabbit infection studies rabbits were inoculated intranasally with emc/2012 strain of mers-cov green arrows and tissue samples were collected for viral titration and histopathology at necropsy blue arrows three rabbits were necropsied at each time point numbers indicate days since virus administration for primary secondary or infections enhanced inflammation after mers reinfection in rabbits plos pathogens | https//doi org/10.1371/journal ppat.1006565 august 17 2017 4 / 25fig 4 viral rna titers and histopathology in the lungs of rabbits following reinfection with mers-cov viral rna titers in the lungs of rabbits following reinfection with emc/2012 a images show h&e left and ihc for the enhanced inflammation after mers reinfection in rabbits plos pathogens | https//doi
wild waterfowl particularly dabbling ducks such as mallards anas platyrhynchos are considered the main reservoir of lowpathogenic avian influenza viruses lpaivs they carry viruses that may evolve and become highly pathogenic for poultry or zoonotic understanding the ecology of lpaivs in these natural hosts is therefore essential we assessed the clinical response viral shedding and antibody production of juvenile mallards after intra-esophageal inoculation of two lpaiv subtypes previously isolated from wild congeners six ducks equipped with data loggers that continually monitored body temperature heart rate and activity were successively inoculated with an h7n7 lpai isolate day 0 the same h7n7 isolate again day 21 and an h5n2 lpai isolate day 35 after the first h7n7 inoculation the ducks remained alert with no modification of heart rate or activity however body temperature transiently increased in four individuals suggesting that lpaiv strains may have minor clinical effects on their natural hosts the excretion patterns observed after both reinoculations differed strongly from those observed after the primary h7n7 inoculation suggesting that not only homosubtypic but also heterosubtypic immunity exist our study suggests that lpai infection has minor clinically measurable effects on mallards and that mallard ducks are able to mount immunological responses protective against heterologous infections because the transmission dynamics of lpaivs in wild populations is greatly influenced by individual susceptibility and herd immunity these findings are of high importance our study also shows the relevance of using telemetry to monitor disease in animals
astrovirus-like coronavirus-like and parvovirus-like particles were detected through electron microscopic em examination of loose and diarrheal stools from a litter of beagle pups banding patterns obtained from equilibrium centrifugations in csc1 supported the em identification densities associated with the identified particles were 1.34 g/ml for astrovirus 1.39 g/ml for "full" parvovirus and 1.24--1.26 g/ml for "typical" coronavirus convalescent sera from the pups aggregated these three particle types as observed by immunoelectron microscopy iem only coronavirus-like particles were later detected in formed stools from these same pups coronavirus and parvo-likc viruses arc recognized agents of canine viral enteritis however astrovirus has not been previously reported in dogs
contrasts sharply with what could be termed the golden era when vaccines against polio- measles mumps rubella and hepatitis b viruses first became available here we attempt to explain why vaccines mainly against viruses other than human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis c virus are still unavailable they include human herpesviruses other than varicella-zoster virus respiratory syncytial and most other respiratory enteric and arthropod-borne viruses improved oral poliovirus vaccines are also urgently required their unavailability is attributable to regulatory/economic factors and the properties of individual viruses but also to an absence of relevant animal models and ethical problems for the conduct of clinical of trials in pediatric and other critical populations all are portents of likely difficulties for the licensing of effective vaccines against emerging pathogens such as avian influenza ebola and zika viruses k e y w o r d s human immunity vaccine development veterinary viruses
background henipaviruses hendra and nipah virus are highly pathogenic members of the family paramyxoviridae fruiteating bats of the pteropus genus have been suggested as their natural reservoir human henipavirus infections have been reported in a region extending from australia via malaysia into bangladesh compatible with the geographic range of pteropus these bats do not occur in continental africa but a whole range of other fruit bats is encountered one of the most abundant is eidolon helvum the african straw-coloured fruit bat methodology/principal findings feces from e helvum roosting in an urban setting in kumasi/ghana were tested for henipavirus rna sequences of three novel viruses in phylogenetic relationship to known henipaviruses were detected virus rna concentrations in feces were low conclusions/significance the finding of novel putative henipaviruses outside australia and asia contributes a significant extension of the region of potential endemicity of one of the most pathogenic virus genera known in humans
an epidemiological survey for canine parvovirus cpv and canine coronavirus ccov infections was conducted in western europe a total of 156 faecal samples were collected from dogs with diarrhoea in spain n = 47 italy n = 39 france n = 26 germany n = 21 the united kingdom n = 8 belgium n = 10 and the netherlands n = 5 using molecular assays for virus detection and characterisation cpv and ccov were found to be widespread in european dog populations either alone or in mixed infections in agreement with previous reports the original type cpv-2 was shown not to circulate in european dogs the recently identified virus variant cpv-2c was predominant in italy and germany and present at high rates in spain and france but was not detected in the uk or belgium except for the uk ccov genotype i was identified in all european countries involved in the survey albeit at a lower prevalence rates than ccov genotype ii
using a standard cellular fusion technique and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa a hybridoma cell line strain secreting anti-hbs monoclonal antibody mab defined g6 mab was obtained the cells grew and secreted mab stably antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048 â10 6 and 4.096 â10 6 respectively by applying the anti-hbs g6 mab and horseradish peroxidase hrp-labeled goat anti-hbs antibody we developed a sandwich elisa defined g6m elisa for detecting both wild-type and immune escape mutant hbsags iem hbsag the assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression hbsag including two wild-type species and 15 iem hbsag species which varied in the "a" determinant in a group of patients infected with hepatitis b virus hbv the patients previously had a lower elisa detection signal . the results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild-type hbsag was no less than 0.125 μg/l 12 of 15 iem hbsag species p/n≥2.5 were positive for g6 mab of the positive iem hbsag species two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm a 450 one had an intermediate a 450 value and nine had a high a 450 value which was 7.55%mean 59.4% and 92.1%-109.4% of the wild-type a 450 value respectively the two species with low a 450 value and the three negative species mutated at the bases 120-124 in the first loop of the hbv "a" determinant using the g6 elisa and two commercial elisa kits a and b 177 patients were tested the g6 elisa had a significantly higher detection rate than either commercial elisas 19.21% vs 14.89% and 6.21% respectively p < 0.01 p < 0.05 respectively
in this paper we introduce a single serotype transmission model including an agedependent mosquito biting rate to find the optimal vaccination age against dengue in brazil with dengvaxia the optimal vaccination age and minimal lifetime expected risk of hospitalisation are found by adapting a method due to hethcote math biosci 8929-52 any number and combination of the four dengue serotypes denv1-4 is considered successful vaccination against a serotype corresponds to a silent infection the effects of antibody-dependent enhancement ade and permanent cross-immunity after two heterologous infections are studied ade is assumed to imply risk-free primary infections while permanent cross-immunity implies risk-free tertiary and quaternary infections data from trials of dengvaxia indicate vaccine efficacy to be age and serostatus dependent and vaccination of seronegative individuals to induce an increased risk of hospitalisation some of the scenarios are therefore reconsidered taking these findings into account the optimal vaccination age is compared to that achievable under the current age restriction of the vaccine if vaccination is not considered to induce risk optimal vaccination ages are very low the assumption of ade generally leads to a higher optimal vaccination age in this case for a single serotype vaccination is not recommended in the case of ade permanent cross-immunity results in a slightly lower optimal vaccination age if vaccination induces a risk the optimal vaccination ages are much higher particularly for permanent cross-immunity ade has no effect on the optimal vaccination age when permanent cross-immunity is considered otherwise it leads to a slight increase in optimal vaccination age
viruses in the family papillomaviridae have circular dsdna genomes of approximately 5.7-8.6 kb that are packaged within non-enveloped icosahedral capsids the known papillomavirus pv representatives infect vertebrates and there are currently more than 130 recognized pv species in more than 50 genera we identified 12 novel avian papillomavirus apv types in wild birds that could represent five distinct species and two genera viruses were detected in paired oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from six bird species increasing the number of avian species known to harbor pvs by 40%. a new duck pv dupv-3 was found in mallard and american black duck 27.6% estimated prevalence that was monophyletic with other known dupvs a single viral type was identified in atlantic puffin pupv-1 9.8% estimated prevalence while a higher genetic diversity was found in other charadriiformes specifically three types were identified in two gull species estimated prevalence of 17% and 2.6% in american herring and great black-backed gull respectively and seven types were found in black-legged kittiwake 81.3% estimated prevalence significantly higher dupv-3 circulation was observed in spring compared to fall and in adults compared to juveniles the studied host species' tendencies to be in crowded environments likely affect infection rates and their migratory behaviors could explain the high viral diversity illustrating how host behavior can influence viral ecology and distribution for dupv-3 gupv-1 pupv-1 and kipv-2 we obtained the complete genomic sequences which showed the same organization as other known apvs phylogenetic analyses showed evidence for virushost co-divergence at the host taxonomic levels of family order and inter-order but we also observed that host-specificity constraints are relaxed among highly related hosts as we found cross-species transmission within ducks and within gulls furthermore the phylogeny of viruses infecting the charadriiformes did not match the host phylogeny and gull viruses formed distinct monophyletic clades with kittiwake viruses possibly reflecting past host-switching events considering the vast pv genotype diversity in other hosts and the large number of bird species many more apvs likely remain to be discovered
the evolutionary history of the astroviridae comprises the ancient separation between avian and mammalian astrovirus lineages followed by diversification among mammalian astroviruses the latter process included several cross-species transmissions we found that the recent but not the ancient evolution of astroviruses was associated with a switch in nucleotide composition and codon usage among non-human mammalian versus human/avian astroviruses virus and hosts phylogenies based on codon usage agreed with each other and matched the hosts' evolutionary emergence order this recent switch in driving forces acting at the synonymous level points to the adaptation of codon usage by viruses to that of their hosts after cross-species transmissions this is the first demonstration of nucleotide composition and codon usage being active driving forces during the recent evolutionary history of a virus group in the host-parasite system
although heterotypic secondary infection with dengue virus denv is associated with severe disease the majority of secondary infections are mild or asymptomatic the mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood in 2010 108 denv3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in managua nicaragua with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections we analyzed denv-specific neutralization titers nt 50 igm and igg avidity and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3 6 and 18 months post-infection nt 50 titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter igg avidity to denv3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary denv infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary denv infections while avidity to denv2 a likely previous infecting serotype was initially higher than avidity to denv3 in secondary denv infections the opposite relation was observed 3-18 months post-infection we found significant correlations between igm avidity and nt 50 in acute primary cases and between igg avidity and nt 50 in secondary denv infections in summary our findings indicate that igm antibodies likely play a role in early control of denv infections igg serum avidity to denv analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotypes to the current infecting serotype over time finally serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity
a replicon-based dna vaccine encoding vp2 gene of canine parvovirus cpv was developed by cloning cpv-vp2 gene into a replicon-based dna vaccine vector palpha the characteristics of a replicon-based dna vaccine like self-amplification of transcripts and induction of apoptosis were analyzed in transfected mammalian cells when the palpha-cpv-vp2 was injected intradermal as dna-launched repliconbased dna vaccine in dogs it induced cpv-specific humoral and cell mediated immune responses the virus neutralization antibody and lymphocyte proliferative responses were higher than conventional cpv dna vaccine and commercial cpv vaccine these results indicated that dna-launched repliconbased cpv dna vaccine was effective in inducing both cpv-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and can be considered as effective alternative to conventional cpv dna vaccine and commercial cpv vaccine crown
ibv nonstructural protein 5 nsp5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay a b s t r a c t infectious bronchitis virus ibv continues to be one of the most important poultry pathogens worldwide the current commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits for ibv specific antibody detection are mostly based on the whole virion and few serological tests based on nonstructural proteins of ibv have been developed herein an alternative indirect elisa for detection of ibv antibody was developed with ibv nonstructural protein 5 nsp5 produced by escherichia coli using an indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa and a commercial elisa kit as reference we optimized the nsp5-elisa and determined its cut-off as 0.12 the diagnostic sensitivity dsn specificity dsp and accuracy of the nsp5-elisa were 93.11% 95.38% and 93.33% respectively compared with ifa in 660 field serum samples and were 98.11% 95.00% and 97.62% respectively compared with the commercial ibv elisa kit idexx in 126 field sera samples furthermore a time course of ibv specific antibody level detected by nsp5-elisa following ibv infection and vaccination is consistent with that of ibv antibody detected by the commercial elisa kit the results presented in this study indicate that nsp5-elisa has the potential to serve as a rapid reliable and cost-effective method for ibv antibody detection this study is the first to report the development of an nsp-based elisa to detect an antibody to ibv
the lower than expected number of sars-cov-2 cases in countries with fragile health systems is puzzling herein we hypothesize that bcg vaccination policies adopted by different countries might influence the sars-cov-2 transmission patterns and/or covid-19 associated morbidity and mortality through the vaccine's capacity to confer heterologous protection we also postulate that until a specific vaccine is developed sars-cov-2 vulnerable populations could be immunized with bcg vaccines to attain heterologous nonspecific protection from the new coronavirus
the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv poses a great threat to the global swine industries and the unreliable protection induced by the currently available vaccines remains a major challenge we previously generated a genogroup 2b g2b pedv taiwan pintung 52 pedvpt strain pedvpt-p96 and determined its promising host immune response against the virulent pedvpt-p5 strain to study the attenuation determinants of pedvpt-p96 and establish a pedvpt-p96-based recombinant vector as a vaccine platform for further antigenicity modification ipedvpt-p96 a full-length cdna clone of pedvpt-p96 was established comparing to the parental pedvpt-p96 virus the ipedvpt-p96 virus showed efficient replication kinetics with a delayed decline of viral load and similar but much more uniform plaque sizes in vero cells in the 5-week-old piglet model fecal viral shedding was observed in the pedvpt-p96-inoculated piglets whereas those inoculated with ipedvpt-p96 showed neither detectable fecal viral shedding nor pedv-associated clinical signs moreover inoculation with ipedvpt-p96 elicited comparable levels of anti-pedv specific plasma igg and fecal/salivary iga neutralizing antibody titers and similar but less effective immunoprotection against the virulent pedvpt-p5 challenge compared to the parental pedvpt-p96 in the present study an infectious cdna clone of an attenuated g2b pedv strain was successfully generated for the first time and the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that ipedvpt-p96 is further attenuated but remains immunogenic compared to its parental pedvpt-p96 viral stock the successful development of the ipedvpt-p96 cdna clone could allow for the manipulation of the viral genome to study viral pathogenesis and facilitate the rapid development of effective vaccines
vibrio anguillarum is a pathogenic bacterium that infects flounder resulting in significant losses in the aquaculture industry the vaa protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish in the present study a recombinant dna plasmid encoding the vaa gene of v anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a dna vaccine to prevent the infection of v anguillarum in flounder fish investigated we verified the expression of the vaa protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish the protective effects of pcdna3.1-vaa pvaa were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sigm + cd4-1 + cd4-2 + cd8β + lymphocytes and the production of vaa-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the dna vaccine histopathological changes in immune related tissues bacterial load and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with v anguillarum were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pvaa dna vaccine candidate fish intramuscularly immunized with pvaa showed a significant increase in cd4-1 + cd4-2 + and cd8β + t lymphocytes at days 9 11 and 14 post-vaccination reaching peak t-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization the percentage of sigm + lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4-5 post-immunization specific anti-v anguillarum or anti-rvaa antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28-35 post-immunization the liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish additionally a lower bacterial burden in the liver spleen and kidney were observed in pvaa protected fish in response to bacterial challenge compared with pcdna3.1 vector control injected fish moreover the pvaa vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following v anguillarum infection in summary this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the t lymphocyte response followed by b lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of dna immunization of flounder this signifies the important potential of pvaa as a dna vaccine candidate for the control of v anguillarum infection

it is likely that phylogroup 2 lyssaviruses circulate within bat reservoirs we adapted a pseudotype pt neutralisation assay pna to a multiplex format enabling serosurveillance for lagos bat virus lbv mokola virus mokv and west caucasian bat virus wcbv in a potential reservoir the african straw-coloured fruit bat eidolon helvum highly correlated titres were observed between single and multiplex pnas using ptlbv and ptmokv r =0.97 p b 0.0001 validating its use for bat serosurveillance of the bat serum samples screened 56% neutralised ptlbv 27% ptmokv and 1% ptwcbv mean vnab titres were 1266 135 and 17 against ptlbv ptmokv and ptwcbv respectively the high seroprevalence estimates suggest that the infection rate of lbv in e helvum remains high enough to persist in this species this supports the hypothesis that lbv is endemic in ghanaian e helvum and we speculate that lbv may have co-evolved with african megachiroptera
zoonotic transmissions of emerging pathogens from wildlife to human have shaped the history of mankind these events have also highlighted our poor understanding of microorganisms circulated in wild animals coronaviruses and astroviruses which can be found from a wide range of mammals were recently detected in bats strikingly these bat viruses are genetically highly diverse and these interesting findings might help to better understand the evolution and ecology of these viruses the discoveries of these novel bats viruses not only suggested that bats are important hosts for these virus families but also reiterated the role of bats as a reservoir of viruses that might pose a zoonotic threat to human health
a novel porcine deltacoronavirus pdcv was first discovered in ohio and indiana in february 2014 rapidly spread to other states in the united states and canada and caused significant economic loss in the swine industry the origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus are not known here we characterized u s pdcv isolates and determined their virulence in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets genome analyses revealed that u s pdcv isolates possess unique genetic characteristics and share a close relationship with hong kong and south korean pdcv strains and coronaviruses covs of asian leopard cats and chinese ferret-badgers the pdcv-positive intestinal content ohio cvm1 and the cell culture-adapted pdcv michigan mi strain were orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and/or conventional piglets within 1 to 3 days postinfection profuse watery diarrhea vomiting and dehydration were observed clinical signs were associated with epithelial necrosis in the gastric pits and small intestine the latter resulting in severe villous atrophy mild interstitial pneumonia was identified in the lungs of pdcvinfected piglets high levels of viral rna 8 to 11 log rna copies/g were detected in intestinal tissues/luminal contents and feces of infected piglets whereas moderate rna levels 2 to 5 log rna copies/g were detected in blood lung liver and kidney indicating multisystemic dissemination of the virus polyclonal immune serum against pdcv but not immune serum against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv reacted with pdcv-infected small-intestinal epithelial cells indicating that pdcv is antigenically distinct from pedv collectively we demonstrate for the first time that pdcv caused severe gastrointestinal diseases in swine indiana and subsequently spread rapidly across the united states and canada causing significant economic losses here we report the detailed genetic characterization phylogeny and virulence of emergent pdcv strains in the united states we found that pdcv caused severe diarrhea vomiting and dehydration in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets signs that were clinically indistinguishable from those caused by pedv and tgev in addition to extensive intestinal lesions pdcv caused significant lesions in the stomach and mild pulmonary lesions that have not been reported for tgev and pedv the finding that pdcv is a significant enteric disease of swine highlights the need to develop effective measures to control this disease . 2015 origin evolution and virulence of porcine deltacoronaviruses in the united states mbio 62 e00064-15
pemphigus vulgaris pv is an autoimmune bullous disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by the presence of circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies against keratinocyte cell surface antigens specifically desmoglein dsg 1 and 3 the pathogenic role of anti-dsg antibodies is well-established while the mechanism of blister formation is only partly defined we have applied a previously developed method for the efficient immortalization of igg+ memory b cells to identify novel target antigens in pv a human monoclonal antibody reactive with a hitherto unreported non-dsg antigen was isolated immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies with keratinocyte extracts indicated α-catenin as the putative antigen then confirmed by immunoblotting on the recombinant protein four of ten pv sera reacted with recombinant α-catenin although the isolated human monoclonal antibody was per se unable to dissociate keratinocyte monolayers and also to synergize with a pathogenic antibody in vitro further studies are warranted to assess its possible in vivo contribution in the multifactorial pathogenesis and heterogeneous manifestations of pv disease

porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome prrs is a viral pandemic that especially affects neonates within the ''critical window'' of immunological development prrs was recognized in 1987 and within a few years became pandemic causing an estimated yearly $600000 economic loss in the usa with comparative losses in most other countries the causative agent is a single-stranded positive-sense enveloped arterivirus prrsv that infects macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells despite the discovery of prrsv in 1991 and the publication of[2000 articles the control of prrs is problematic despite the large volume of literature on this disease the cellular and molecular mechanisms describing how prrsv dysregulates the host immune system are poorly understood we know that prrsv suppresses innate immunity and causes abnormal b cell proliferation and repertoire development often lymphopenia and thymic atrophy the prrsv genome is highly diverse rapidly evolving but amenable to the generation of many mutants and chimeric viruses for experimental studies prrsv only replicates in swine which adds to the experimental difficulty since no inbred well-defined animal models are available in this article we summarize current knowledge and apply it toward developing a series of provocative and testable hypotheses to explain how prrsv immunomodulates the porcine immune system with the goal of adding new perspectives on this disease
direct interspecies transmissions of group a rotaviruses rva have been reported under natural conditions however the pathogenicity of rva has never been directly compared in homologous and heterologous hosts the bovine rva/cow-tc/kor/k5/2004/g5p strain which was shown to possess a typical porcine-like genotype constellation similar to that of the g5p prototype rva/pig-tc/usa/osu/1977/g5p9 strain was examined for its pathogenicity and compared with the porcine g5p rva/pig-tc/kor/k71/2006/g5p strain possessing the same genotype constellation the bovine k5 strain induced diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets and calves whereas the porcine k71 strain caused diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets but not in calves furthermore the bovine k5 strain showed extra-intestinal tropisms in both piglets and calves whereas the porcine k71 strain had extra-intestinal tropisms in piglets but not in calves therefore we performed comparative genomic analysis of the k71 and k5 rva strains to determine whether specific mutations could be associated with these distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes full-length sequencing analyses for the 11 genomic segments for k71 and k5 revealed that these strains were genetically nearly identical to each other two nucleotide mutations were found in the 5′ untranslated region utr of nsp5 and the 3′ utr of nsp3 and eight amino acid mutations in vp1-vp4 and nsp2 some of these mutations may be critical molecular determinants for rva virulence and/or pathogenicity
rotavirus has been recognised for 30 years as the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis in infants and young children by contrast the role of rotavirus as a pathogen in adults has long been underappreciated spread by faecal-oral transmission rotavirus infection in adults typically manifests with nausea malaise headache abdominal cramping diarrhoea and fever infection can also be symptomless limited diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives are available for adults with suspected rotavirus infection because symptoms are generally self-limiting supportive care is the rule clinicians caring for adults with gastroenteritis should consider rotavirus in the differential diagnosis in this review we intend to familiarise clinicians who primarily provide care for adult patients with the salient features of rotavirus pathophysiology clinical presentation epidemiology treatment and prevention 2004 4 91-99 lancet infect dis
a new enteric virus of adult horses equine coronavirus ecov has recently been recognized it is associated with fever lethargy anorexia and less frequently colic and diarrhea this enteric virus is transmitted via the feco-oral route and horses become infected by ingesting fecally contaminated feed and water various outbreaks have been reported since 2010 from japan europe and the usa while the clinical signs are fairly non-specific lymphopenia and neutropenia are often seen specific diagnosis is made by the detection of ecov in feces by either quantitative real-time pcr electron microscopy or antigen-capture elisa supportive treatment is usually required as most infections are self-limiting however rare complications such as endotoxemia septicemia and hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy have been reported and have been related to the loss of barrier function at the intestinal mucosa this review article will focus on the latest information pertaining to the virus epidemiology clinical signs diagnosis pathology treatment and prevention of ecov infection in adult horses
it is well established that several wild aquatic bird species serve as reservoirs for the influenza a virus it has also been shown that the influenza a virus can be transmitted to mammalian species such as tigers and domestic cats and dogs through ingestion of infected birds another group of animals that should also be considered as potential hosts for the influenza a virus are the crocodilians many crocodilian species share aquatic environments with wild birds that are known to harbor influenza viruses in addition many large crocodilians utilize birds as a significant food source given these factors in addition to the close taxonomic proximity of aves to the crocodilians it is feasible to ask whether crocodilian species may also harbor the influenza a virus here we analyzed 37 captive crocodilians from two locations in florida plus 5 wild bird fecalsamples from their habitat to detect the presence of influenza a virus several sample types were examined real-time rt-pcr tests targeting the influenza a matrix gene were positive for four individual crocodilians-alligator sinensis paleosuchus trigonatus caiman latirostris and crocodylus niloticus of the seven serum samples tested with the avian influenza virus agar gel immunodiffusion assay three showed a nonspecific reaction to the avian influenza virus antigen-a sinensis p trigonatus and c niloticus c latirostris was not tested viable virus could not be recovered from rt-pcr-positive samples although this is consistent with previous attempts at viral isolation in embryonated chicken eggs with crocodilian viruses
background peyer's patches pps can be considered as the immune site of the intestine within pps dendritic cells dcs can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium and process it and then present to lymphocytes which effectively antigen produces an immune response porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea ped an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease the interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells mo-dcs has been reported however little is known about the interaction between inactivated pedv and dcs in porcine pps results in this study for the first time we investigated the role of dcs in porcine pps after oral administration inactivated pedv firstly a method to isolate dcs from porcine pps was established in which the purity of swc3a + /mhc-ii + dcs was more than 90%. our findings clearly indicate that dcs in porcine pps after oral administration of inactivated pedv not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes but also secreted cytokines il-1 il-4 furthermore the number of dcs and iga + cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-pedv specific igg antibody in the serum and siga antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated pedv conclusions our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated pedv activate dcs in porcine peyer's patches and inactivated pedv may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has caused significant economic losses in the us swine industry since may 2013 a new variant strain of pedv emerged in the us in the late december 2013 this variant strain of pedv differs from the virulent strain of pedv currently circulating in the us in 1170 nt of the 5'end of the s1 domain in the spike gene importantly the variant pedv caused significantly less mortality in piglets than the virulent pedv based on clinical observations this suggests it may be a potential vaccine candidate for ped variant pedv has been detected in samples from multiple states by our laboratory as well as other laboratories in the us it is critical to detect and differentiate variant pedv from the virulent pedv during outbreaks to enhance control and to prevent ped associated disease in this study the development and validation of a duplex real-time rt-pcr assay for detection and differentiation of the variant and the virulent strains of pedv currently circulating in the us was reported
a b s t r a c t cats that live in areas where canine and human leishmaniosis due to leishmania infantum is endemic may become infected and may develop anti-leishmania antibodies in this study 50 clinically normal and 50 cats with cutaneous and/or systemic signs that lived in an endemic area and had been previously examined for infection by l infantum using pcr in four different tissues were serologically tested for the presence of anti-leishmania igg ifat and elisa and igm ifat the aim was to compare the results of ifat elisa and pcr and to investigate the possible associations between seropositivity to leishmania spp and signalment living conditions season of sampling health status of the cats and seropositivity to other infectious agents low concentrations of anti-leishmania igg were detected by ifat in 10% of the cats and by elisa in 1% whereas anti-leishmania igm were detected by ifat in 1%. there was disagreement between the results of ifat and elisa for anti-leishmania igg p = 0.039 and between all serological tests and pcr p < 0.001 the diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests using pcr as the gold standard was very low but elisa and ifat for anti-leishmania igm had 100% specificity the diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests could not be improved by changing the cut-off values seropositivity for leishmania spp was not associated with signalment living conditions season of sampling and health status of the cats or with seropositivity to feline leukemia virus feline immunodeficiency virus feline coronavirus toxoplasma gondii and bartonella henselae in conclusion because of their low sensitivity and very high specificity two of the evaluated serological tests elisa for anti-leishmania igg and ifat for anti-leishmania igm may be useless as population screening tests but valuable for diagnosing feline infection by l infantum
this paper offers an overview of important veterinary viral diseases of mammals stemming from aberrant immune response diseases reviewed comprise those due to lentiviruses of equine infectious anaemia visna/maedi and caprine arthritis encephalitis and feline immunodeficiency diseases caused by viruses of feline infectious peritonitis feline leukaemia canine distemper and aquatic counterparts aleutian disease and malignant catarrhal fever we also consider prospects of immunoprophylaxis for the diseases and briefly other control measures it should be realised that the outlook for effective vaccines for many of the diseases is remote this paper describes the current status of vaccine research and the difficulties encountered during their development
seasonal migration occurs in many animal systems and is likely to influence interactions between animals and their parasites here we focus on monarch butterflies danaus plexippus and a protozoan parasite ophryocystis elektroscirrha to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations two explanations for this pattern are that 1 migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats i e migratory escape and 2 long-distance migration weeds out infected animals i e migratory culling we combined field-sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms analysis of within-breeding-season variation in eastern north america showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity as indexed by larval density among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period collectively these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations
equine arteritis virus eav is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis eva a respiratory and reproductive disease of equids which is notifiable in some countries including the great britain gb and to the oie herein we present the case of a persistently infected stallion and the phylogenetic tracing of the virus strain isolated discussing eav occurrence and phylogenetic analysis we review features which may aid to harmonise and enhance the classification of eav crown
an ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen the ability to obtain disease with an infectious dose equivalent to that causing disease in humans as well having a disease course morbidity and mortality similar to that seen with human disease additionally the animal model should have a modes of transmission that mimics human cases the development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus mpxv has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known although only a few of these models have been used to study anti-poxvirus agents we will review those mpxv small animal models that have been developed thus far for the study of therapeutic agents
background astroviruses are comprised of two genera with avastrovirus infecting birds and mamastrovirus infecting mammals avastroviruses have primarily been associated with infections of poultry especially chicken turkey duck and guineafowl production systems but also infect wading birds and doves outcomes result in a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic shedding to gastroenteritis with diarrhea stunting failure to thrive and death findings virological surveillance was conducted in birds from two sites in cambodia in 2010 samples were screened for influenza astroviruses coronaviruses flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses a total of 199 birds were tested and an astrovirus was detected in a black-naped monarch hypothymis azurea conclusions this is the first astrovirus detection in a passerine bird phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide distances suggest that this avastrovirus forms a distinct lineage and may constitute a fourth avastrovirus group
the adaptive immune response is necessary for the development of protective immunity against infectious diseases porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv a genetically heterogeneous and rapidly evolving rna virus is the most burdensome pathogen of swine health and wellbeing worldwide viral infection induces antigen-specific immunity that ultimately clears the infection however the resulting immune memory induced by virulent or attenuated vaccine viruses is inconsistently protective against diverse viral strains the immunological mechanisms by which primary and memory protection are generated and used are not well understood here we summarize current knowledge regarding cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immune response to prrsv infection that mediate primary and memory immune protection against viruses
current u s requirements for testing cell substrates used in production of human biological products for contamination with bovine and porcine viruses are u s department of agriculture usda 9cfr tests for bovine serum or porcine trypsin 9cfr requires testing of bovine serum for seven specific viruses in six families immunofluorescence and at least 2 additional families non-specifically cytopathicity and hemadsorption 9cfr testing of porcine trypsin is for porcine parvovirus recent contaminations suggest these tests may not be sufficient assay sensitivity was not the issue for these contaminations that were caused by viruses/virus families not represented in the 9cfr screen a detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range and to predict their detection by the currently used 9cfr procedures there are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9cfr testing procedures even within families not all members would necessarily be detected testing gaps and alternative methodologies should be evaluated to continue to ensure safe high quality human biologicals
a phase ii trial was conducted in subjects with human papillomavirus hpv associated high-grade cervical dysplasia testing the safety and efficacy of a microparticle encapsulated pdna vaccine amolimogene expresses t cell epitopes from e6 and e7 proteins of hpv types 16 and 18 an analysis was performed on a subset of hla-a2+ subjects to test whether cd8+ t cells specific to hpv 16 18 6 and 11 were increased in response to amolimogene immunization of the 21 subjects receiving amolimogene 11 had elevated cd8+ t cell responses to hpv 16 and/or 18 peptides and seven of these also had increases to corresponding hpv 6 and/or 11 peptides in addition t cells primed and expanded in vitro with an hpv 18 peptide demonstrated cross-reactivity to the corresponding hpv 11 peptide these data demonstrate that treatment with amolimogene elicits t cell responses to hpv 16 18 6 and 11
sarcocystis neurona is the main agent associated with equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm apart from horses s neurona has been occasionally described causing neurologic disease in several other terrestrial animals as well as mortality in marine mammals herein we describe the clinical pathological and molecular findings of a fatal case of s neurona-associated meningoencephalitis in a domestic cat the causing agent was analyzed by multilocus genotyping confirming the presence of s neurona dna in the tissue samples of the affected animal significant molecular differences were found in relation to s neurona isolates detected in other regions of the americas in addition the parasite was identical to sarcocystis sp identified in opossum sporocysts in brazil at molecular level which suggests that transmission of s neurona in brazil might involve variants of the parasite different from those found elsewhere in the americas studies including more samples of s neurona would be required to test this hypothesis as well as to assess the impact of this diversity
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is an emerging swine coronavirus that causes diarrhea in piglets since the first outbreak of pdcov in the united states in 2014 this novel porcine coronavirus has been detected in south korea canada mexico thailand and china in this study a chinese pdcov strain designated chn-hn-2014 was isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea on a pig farm in henan province china and examined with a specific immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy genomic analysis showed that chn-hn-2014 shares 91.6%-99.4% nucleotide identity with other known pdcov strains the pathogenicity of chn-hn-2014 was further investigated in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets both kinds of piglets developed clear clinical symptoms including vomiting anorexia lethargy and severe diarrhea by 2 days postinoculation dpi and diarrhea persisted for about 5-6 days viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 dpi in challenged 5-day-old pigs and until 18 dpi in challenged 21-day-old pigs at necropsy at 4 dpi macroscopic and microscopic lesions were observed and viral antigen was detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining these data demonstrate that chinese pdcov strain chn-hn-2014 shares high nucleotide identity with previously reported pdcov strains and is pathogenic in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets
the ferret is an established animal model for a number of human respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and more recently ebola virus however a paucity of immunological reagents has hampered the study of cellular immune responses here we describe the development and characterisation of a novel monoclonal antibody mab against the ferret cd4 antigen and the characterisation of ferret cd4 t lymphocytes recombinant production and purification of the ferret cd4 ectodomain soluble protein allowed hybridoma generation and the generation of a mab fecd4 showing strong binding to ferret cd4 protein and lymphoid cells by flow cytometry fecd4 bound to its cognate antigen post-fixation with paraformaldehyde pfa which is routinely used to inactivate highly pathogenic viruses we have also used fecd4 in conjunction with other immune cell markers to characterise ferret t cells in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs in summary we have developed an important reagent for the study of cellular immunological responses in the ferret model of infectious disease
we investigated the clinical impact of human coronaviruses hcov oc43 229e hku1 and nl63 in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis cf during routine and exacerbation visits a total of 408 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 103 patients over a 1-year period samples positive for hcov were submitted for nucleotide sequencing to determine the species nineteen samples 4.65% were positive for hcov of which 8 were positive for nl63 6 for oc43 4 for hku1 and 1 for 229e identification of hcov was not associated with an increased rate of respiratory exacerbations but nl63-positive patients had higher exacerbation rates than patients who were positive for other hcov species
previous studies have suggested that kennelled dogs are more likely to test positive for cecov than household pets here we describe both cross sectional and longitudinal studies in two rescue kennels and two boarding kennels together with molecular diagnostics to provide a new insight into the epidemiology of cecov prevalence of cecov in the cross sectional studies tended to be higher in the rescue kennels 13.8% and 33.3% than the boarding kennels 5.3% and 13.5%. in each kennel type i cecov was more prevalent than type 2 cecov the mean quantity of type i detected was equivalent to 6.3 â 10 8 gc/gm range = 5 â 10 6 8.5 â 10 11 compared to 1.3 â 10 8 gc/gm range = 3 â 10 6 2.4 â 10 10 for type ii in one rescue shelter where dogs were followed longitudinally infection was significantly associated with accommodation block as well as the length of stay increased risk of cecov per week in residence of â1.9 of those animals sampled on two or more occasions none tested positive on arrival and 54.5% later shed cecov suggesting that infection may have been acquired within the kennel shedding patterns and sequence analysis suggested both types i and ii cecov were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission the findings suggest that some kennel environments may be important in maintaining cecov infection in the population we also propose that the diversity of viruses like cecov in these populations may provide a novel surrogate marker for the success of biosecurity
trichomonads are common parasites of many vertebrate and invertebrate species with four species classically recognized as human parasites dientamoeba fragilis pentatrichomonas hominis trichomonas vaginalis and trichomonas tenax the latter two species are considered human-specific by contrast d fragilis and p hominis have been isolated from domestic and farm mammals demonstrating a wide host range and potential zoonotic origin several new studies have highlighted the zoonotic dimension of trichomonads first species typically known to infect birds and domestic mammals have been identified in human clinical samples second several phylogenetic analyses have identified animal-derived trichomonads as close sister taxa of the two human-specific species it is our opinion therefore that these observations prompt further investigation into the importance of zoonotic trichomonads for human health
background the genus ebolavirus of the family filoviridae currently consists of five species all species with the exception of reston ebolavirus have been found in africa and caused severe human diseases bats have been implicated as reservoirs for ebolavirus reston ebolavirus discovered in the philippines is the only ebolavirus species identified in asia to date whether this virus is prevalent in china is unknown findings in this study we developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa for ebolavirus using the recombinant nucleocapsid protein and performed sero-surveillance for the virus among chinese bat populations our results revealed the presence of antibodies to ebolavirus in 32 of 843 bat sera samples and 10 of 16 were further confirmed by western blot analysis conclusion to our knowledge this is the first report of any filovirus infection in china
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv highly pathogenic prrsv hp-prrsv nonstructural protein 9 nsp9 mutant virus replication efficiency virulence a b s t r a c t the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus hp-prrsv has caused huge economic losses to the swine industry in china understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of hp-prrsv is essential for effectively controlling clinical infection and disease in the current study we constructed and rescued a serial of mutant viruses in nsp9 and nsp10 based on the differential amino acid sites between hp-prrsv jxwn06 and lp-prrsv hb-1/3.9 the replication efficiency in pulmonary alveolar macrophages pams and the pathogenicity of the mutant viruses for piglets were analyzed our results showed that the mutation of thr to ala in 586 and ser to thr in 592 of nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of hp-prrsv in pams and could attenuate its virulence for piglets suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 of nsp9 are critical sites natively in determining the fatal virulence of the chinese hp-prrsv for piglets
background with the recent discovery of novel h17n10 and h18n11 influenza viral rna in bats and report on high frequency of avian h9 seroconversion in a species of free ranging bats an important issue to address is the extent bats are susceptible to conventional avian and human influenza a viruses method to this end three bat species eidolon helvum carollia perspicillata and tadarida brasiliensis of lung epithelial cells were separately infected with two avian and two human influenza viruses to determine their relative host innate immune resistance to infection results all three species of bat cells were more resistant than positive control madin-darby canine kidney mdck cells to all four influenza viruses tb1-lu cells lacked sialic acid α26-gal receptors and were most resistant among the three bat species interestingly avian viruses were relatively more replication permissive in all three bat species of cells than with the use of human viruses which suggest that bats could potentially play a role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses chemical inhibition of the jak-stat pathway in bat cells had no effect on virus production suggesting that type i interferon signalling is not a major factor in resisting influenza virus infection conclusion although all three species of bat cells are relatively more resistant to influenza virus infection than control mdck cells they are more permissive to avian than human viruses which suggest that bats could have a contributory role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses
previously we have identified a truncated antigenic fragment named protein c as the immunodominant fragment of spike s protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov we have now successfully expressed protein c using the baculovirus system in s frugiperda sf-9 cells this recombinant baculovirus expressing protein c was first characterized using five sars convalescent human sera and five normal human sera the results showed that protein c is an authentic antigen against sars-cov antibody our spike protein-based immunoflourescence assay ifa based on this recombinant baculovirus-sf-9 system was further assessed with a panel of 163 clinical samples collected during the sars epidemic in singapore which include samples from 21 clinically confirmed sars 42 non-sars patient sera and 100 normal sera the results were compared to a commercial sars ifa kit euroimmun germany and a conventional ifa test performed in singapore general hospital all of the 21 sars-positive serum samples could be recognized by our ifa giving a specificity and sensitivity of 100% which was compatible with both whole virus-based ifa assays no cross-reactivity with serum samples against infectious bronchitis virus ibv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev were detected in our assays thus our spike proteinbased ifa could offer a safer procedure which can be performed in a bsl-2 laboratory as it could mimic the whole virus based-ifa without any loss of sensitivity and specificity it is also more user-friendly and cost-effective than the whole virus-based ifa d
background recent severe outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv in asia and north america highlight the need for well-validated diagnostic tests for the identification of pedv infected animals and evaluation of their immune status to this virus pedv was first detected in the u s in may 2013 and spread rapidly across the country some serological assays for pedv have been previously described but few were readily available in the u s several u s laboratories quickly developed indirect fluorescent antibody ifa assays for the detection of antibodies to pedv in swine serum indicating prior exposure however the ifa has several disadvantages including low throughput and relatively subjective interpretation different serologic test formats have advantages and disadvantages depending on the questions being asked so a full repertoire of tests is useful therefore the objective of this study was to develop and validate multiple improved serological assays for pedv including an indirect elisa ielisa a highly specific monoclonal antibody-based blocking elisa belisa fluorescent microsphere immunoassays fmia that can be multiplexed to monitor exposure to multiple antigens and pathogens simultaneously and a fluorescent focus neutralization assay ffn to measure functional virus neutralizing antibodies results a recombinant north american nucleoprotein np based ielisa was developed and validated along with a belisa using newly developed pedv-np specific biotinylated monoclonal antibodies mabs and an fmia using magnetic beads coupled with expressed na pedv-np receiver operating characteristic roc analysis was performed using swine serum samples ielisa n = 1486 belisa n = 1186 fmia n = 1420 the roc analysis for the fmia showed estimated sensitivity and specificity of 98.2 and 99.2 % respectively the ielisa and belisa showed a sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 97.6 % and 98.2 and 98.9 % respectively inter-rater kappa agreement was calculated to be 0.941 between ielisa and ifa 0.945 between belisa and ifa and 0.932 between fmia and ifa similar comparative kappa values were observed between the ielisa belisa and fmia which demonstrated a significant level of testing agreement among the three assays no cross-reactivity with the closely related coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev or porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv was noted with these assays all three assays detected seroconversion of naïve animals within 6-9 days post exposure the ffn assay allows relative quantitation of functional neutralizing antibodies in serum milk or colostrum samples conclusion well-validated ielisa belisa and fmia assays for the detection of pedv antibodies were developed and showed good correlation with ifa and each other each assay format has advantages that dictate how they will be used in the field newly developed mabs to the pedv-np were used in the belisa and for expediting ffn testing in the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibodies in addition these pedv mabs are useful for immunohistochemistry fluorescent antibody staining and other antigen-based tests measurement of neutralizing antibody responses using the ffn assay may provide a valuable tool for assessment of vaccine candidates or protective immunity
this paper describes how often pet dogs interact with other dogs people and the environment whilst being walked such interactions may involve aggression or the transmission of infectious disease we also assessed the effect of the use of a leash as a modifier of these outcomes in study one the behaviour of pet dogs being walked in popular public walking areas was observed 286 observations interactions with people were much rarer than interactions with dogs multivariable modelling suggested that percentage duration spent sniffing the ground was associated with the uk kennel club breed type and whether the dog was observed urinating gundogs were observed to sniff more than other breed types in study two dogs n = 10 were filmed twice walking along a pre-defined route alternately once on leash and once off leash in order to assess the effects of leash use on interactions between the subject dog and any other dog or person encountered multilevel modelling suggested that if either dog was on the leash then the likelihood of an interaction with a dog occurring was reduced there was no evidence for statistical interactions between these variables therefore the effect of the leash on one dog did not seem to be influenced by whether the other dog was on or off leash we conclude that in circumstances where interactions need to be prevented such as to reduce spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak both dogs should be leashed
continuous epidemiological surveillance of existing and emerging viruses and their associated disorders is gaining importance in light of their abilities to cause unpredictable outbreaks as a result of increased travel and vaccination choices by steadily growing and aging populations close surveillance of outbreaks and herd immunity are also at the forefront even in industrialized countries where previously eradicated viruses are now at risk of re-emergence due to instances of strain recombination contractions in viral vector geographies and from their potential use as agents of bioterrorism there is a great need for the rational design of current and future vaccines targeting viruses with a strong focus on vaccine targeting of adaptive immune effector memory t cells as the gold standard of immunity conferring long-lived protection against a wide variety of pathogens and malignancies here we review viruses that have historically caused large outbreaks and severe lethal disorders including respiratory gastric skin hepatic neurologic and hemorrhagic fevers to observe trends in vaccinology against these viral disorders we describe viral genetic replication transmission and tropism host-immune evasion strategies and the epidemiology and health risks of their associated syndromes we focus on immunity generated against both natural infection and vaccination where a steady shift in conferred vaccination immunogenicity is observed from quantifying activated and proliferating long-lived effector memory t cell subsets as the prominent biomarkers of long-term immunity against viruses and their associated disorders causing high morbidity and mortality rates
although viruses are not the key players of the anaerobic digestion process they may affect the dynamics of bacterial and archaeal populations involved in biogas production until now viruses have received very little attention in this specific habitat therefore as a first step towards their characterization we optimized a virus filtration protocol from anaerobic sludge afterwards to assess dsdna and rna viral diversity in sludge samples from nine different reactors fed either with waste water agricultural residues or solid municipal waste plus agro-food residues we performed metagenomic analyses as a result we showed that while the dsdna viromes 21 assigned families in total were dominated by dsdna phages of the order caudovirales rna viruses 14 assigned families in total were less diverse and were for the main part plant-infecting viruses interestingly less than 2% of annotated contigs were assigned as putative human and animal pathogens our study greatly extends the existing view of viral genetic diversity in methanogenic reactors and shows that these viral assemblages are distinct not only among the reactor types but also from nearly 30 other environments already studied including the human gut fermented food deep sea sediments and other aquatic habitats
immunochromatography ic is an antigen-detection assay that plays an important role in the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus because the protocol is short time and easy to use despite the usability of ic the sensitivity is approximately 10 3 pfu per reaction in addition antigen-antibody interaction-based method cannot be used for the detection of influenza viruses with major antigenic change in this study we established the use of fluorescent immunochromatography flic to detect a broad spectrum of h5 subtype influenza a viruses this method has improved sensitivity 10-100 fold higher than traditional ic because of the use of fluorescent conjugated beads our type-e flic kit detected all of the h5 subtype influenza viruses that were examined as well as recombinant hemagglutinin ha proteins rhas belonging to the eurasian h5 subtype viruses and the type-n diagnosed north american h5 subtype influenza a viruses thus this kit has the improved potential to detect h5 subtype influenza viruses of different clades with both type-e and type-n flic kits compared with pcr-based diagnosis flic has a strong advantage in usability because the sample preparation required for flic is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as rna extraction our results can provide new strategies against the spread and transmission of hpai h5n1 viruses in birds and mammals including humans
foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv is a highly infectious member of the picornaviridae inducing an acute disease of cloven-hoofed species vaccine-induced immune protection correlates with the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies but also opsonising antibodies have been proposed as an important mechanism of the immune response contributing to virus clearance by macrophages and leading to the production of type-i interferon ifn by plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdc the present study demonstrates that the opsonising antibody titres mediating enhanced ifn-α responses in pdc were similar to neutralizing titres when antigenically related viruses from the same serotype were employed however sera cross-reacted also with non-neutralized isolates of multiple serotypes when tested in this assay both uncomplexed virus and immune complexed virus stimulated pdc via toll-like receptor 7 an additional finding of potential importance for strain-specific differences in virulence and/or immunogenicity was that pdc activation by fmdv strongly differed between viral isolates altogether our results indicate that opsonising antibodies can have a broader reactivity than neutralizing antibodies and may contribute to antiviral responses induced against antigenically distant viruses
a molecular survey for traditional and emerging pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease cird was conducted in italy between 2011 and 2013 on a total of 138 dogs including 78 early acute clinically ill cird animals 22 non-clinical but exposed to clinically ill cird dogs and 38 cird convalescent dogs the results showed that canine parainfluenza virus cpiv was the most commonly detected cird pathogen followed by canine respiratory coronavirus crcov bordetella bronchiseptica mycoplasma cynos mycoplasma canis and canine pneumovirus cnpnv some classical cird agents such as canine adenoviruses canine distemper virus and canid herpesvirus 1 were not detected at all as were not other emerging respiratory viruses canine influenza virus canine hepacivirus and bacteria streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus most severe forms of respiratory disease were observed in the presence of cpiv crcov and m cynos alone or in combination with other pathogens whereas single cnpnv or m canis infections were detected in dogs with no or very mild respiratory signs interestingly only the association of m cynos alone or in combination with either crcov or m canis with severe clinical forms was statistically significant the study while confirming cpiv as the main responsible for cird occurrence highlights the increasing role of recently discovered viruses such as crcov and cnpnv for which effective vaccines are not available in the market
studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using canine herpesvirus chv as a vaccine vector for bait-delivered oral vaccination of wild foxes to test the viability of chv in baits chv was freeze-dried incorporated into different baits stored and the remaining viral infectivity tested in cell culture after varying periods of time at different storage temperatures experimental baits mouse carcasses and commercial baits foxoff and probait were prepared with either liquid or freeze-dried chvand tested in two fox trials for their capacity to induce chv-specific antibodies following oral baiting freezedrying and storage temperatures below 0 8c had a stabilizing effect to virus infectivity when stored at à20 8c freeze-dried chv retained its full infectivity for up to 3 months in probait baits the remaining infectivity in foxoff baits was 100-fold less oral baiting with chv induced antiviral serum antibodies in all vaccinated foxes 20/20 none of the vaccinated foxes became ill or shed infectious virus into the environment although viral dna was detected in body secretions as evaluated by pcr the results indicate that chv can be freeze-dried and stored over extended periods of time without loosing much of its infectivity this is the first report of chv being used for oral bait vaccination of foxes it appears that chv is well suited for use as a recombinant vector for wild canids #
virus-like particles vlps hold tremendous potential as vaccine candidates these innovative biopharmaceuticals present the remarkable advantages of closely mimicking the three-dimensional nature of an actual virus while lacking the virus genome packaged inside its capsid as a result an equally efficient but safer prophylaxis is anticipated as compared to inactivated or live attenuated viral vaccines with the advent of successful cases of approved vlp-based vaccines pharmaceutical companies are indeed redirecting their resources to the development of such products this paper reviews the current choices and trends of large-scale production and purification of vlp-based vaccines generated through the baculovirus expression vector system using insect cells
coxsackie virus h3 such antiviral properties were mainly explained by virucidal mechanism moreover mlt protected mice which were challenged with lethal doses of pathogenic influenza a h1n1 viruses therefore these results provides the evidence that bv and mlt could be a potential source as a promising antiviral agent especially to develop as a broad spectrum antiviral agent
human rhinovirus hrv remains a leading cause of several human diseases including the common cold despite considerable research over the last 60 years development of an effective vaccine to hrv has been viewed by many as unfeasible due in part to the antigenic diversity of circulating hrvs in nature over 150 antigenically distinct types of hrv are currently known which span three species hrv a hrv b and hrv c early attempts to develop a rhinovirus vaccine have shown that inactivated hrv is capable of serving as a strong immunogen and inducing neutralizing antibodies yet limitations to virus preparation and recovery continued identification of antigenic variants of hrv and logistical challenges pertaining to preparing a polyvalent preparation of the magnitude required for true efficacy against circulating rhinoviruses continue to prove a daunting challenge in this review we describe hrv biology antigenic diversity and past and present advances in hrv vaccine design
immune responses following mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb infection or vaccination are frequently assessed by measuring t-cell recognition of crude mtb antigens recombinant proteins or peptide epitopes we previously showed that not all mtb-specific t cells recognize mtb-infected macrophages thus an important question is what proportion of t cells elicited by mtb infection recognize mtb-infected macrophages we address this question by developing a modified elispot assay using viable mtb-infected macrophages a low multiplicity of infection and purified t cells in c57bl/6 mice cd4 and cd8 t cells were classically mhc restricted comparable frequencies of t cells that recognize mtb-infected macrophages were determined using interferon-γ elispot and intracellular cytokine staining and lung cd4 t cells more sensitively recognized mtb-infected macrophages than lung cd8 t cells compared to the relatively high frequencies of t cells specific for antigens such as esat-6 and tb10.4 low frequencies of total pulmonary t cells elicited by aerosolized mtb infection recognize mtb-infected macrophages finally we demonstrate that bcg vaccination elicits t cells that recognize mtb-infected macrophages we propose that the frequency of t cells that recognize infected macrophages could correlate with protective immunity and may be an alternative approach to measuring t-cell responses to mtb antigens

a new human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was identified in 2003 which raised concern about coronaviruses as agents of serious infectious disease nevertheless coronaviruses have been known for about 50 years to be major agents of respiratory enteric or systemic infections of domestic and companion animals feline and canine coronaviruses are widespread among dog and cat populations sometimes leading to the fatal diseases known as feline infectious peritonitis fip and pantropic canine coronavirus infection in cats and dogs respectively in this paper different aspects of the genetics host cell tropism and pathogenesis of the feline and canine coronaviruses fcov and ccov will be discussed with a view to illustrating how study of fcovs and ccovs can improve our general understanding of the pathobiology of coronaviruses
background differential diagnose of japanese encephalitis virus jev infection from other flavivirus especially west nile virus wnv and dengue virus dv infection was greatly hindered for the serological cross-reactive virus specific epitopes could benefit for developing jev specific antibodies detection methods to identify the jev specific epitopes we fully mapped and characterized the continuous b-cell epitope of the prm/m protein of jev results to map the epitopes on the prm/m protein we designed a set of 20 partially overlapping fragments spanning the whole prm fused them with gst and expressed them in an expression vector linear epitope m14 105 vnkkeawldstkatry 120 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa by removing amino acid residues individually from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptide m14 we confirmed that the minimal unit of the linear epitope of prm/m was m14-13 108 keawldstkat 118 . this epitope was highly conserved across different jev strains moreover this epitope did not cross-react with wnv-positive and denv-positive sera conclusion epitope m14-13 was a jev specific lineal b-cell epitpe the results may provide a useful basis for the development of epitope-based virus specific diagnostic clinical techniques
lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by lassa virus lasv which is endemic throughout much of west africa the virus primarily circulates in the mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions human-to-human transmission is documented as well with the exception of dengue fever lasv has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus on-going outbreaks in nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality consequently the world health organization who has listed lasv as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics currently there are no licensed vaccines to protect against lasv infection although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models to date only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements the absence of established correlates of protection and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans this review briefly discusses the epidemiology and biology of lasv infection and highlights recent progress in vaccine development
an important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses subunit vaccines virus-like particles vlps dna vaccines heterologous expression systems and vaccines derived from sars-cov genome by reverse genetics this review describes several aspects essential to develop sars-cov vaccines such as the correlates of protection virus serotypes vaccination side effects and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars-cov genome the production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent sars has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses that in general has been less successful after preclinical trials in animal models efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans
during an 8-yr period 862 stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid ph 6.5 fortyone percent of the specimens submitted over an 8-yr period were determined to be positive for virus or viruslike particles belonging to one or more of seven morphologically distinct viral groups coronavirus-like particles cvlps were present in 69.8% of the positive stool specimens membranous profiles containing "complement-type" holes 10 nm in diameter were identified in some preparations containing cvlps the second most prevalent viral agent found in stool specimens was the rotavirus 17% of all positive stools the incidence of other viruses identified in the survey were as follows adenovirus 4.5% picorna/parvovirus agents 2.9% norwalk-like agent 2.9% astrovirus 1.9% and calicivirus 0.5%. unclassified small round viruses -25-30 nm in diameter represented 0.5%. it was also determined that there was a seasonal distribution in excretion of all viruses except for cvlps a greater number of viruses were identified in the cooler drier months of the year
although rodents are important reservoirs for rna viruses to date only one species of rodent coronavirus cov has been identified herein we describe a new cov denoted lucheng rn rat coronavirus lrnv and novel variants of two betacoronavirus species termed longquan aa mouse coronavirus lamv and longquan rl rat coronavirus lrlv that were identified in a survey of 1465 rodents sampled in china during 2011-2013 phylogenetic analysis revealed that lamv and lrlv fell into lineage a of the genus betacoronavirus which included covs discovered in humans and domestic and wild animals in contrast lrnv harbored by rattus norvegicus formed a distinct lineage within the genus alphacoronavirus in the 3cl pro rdrp and hel gene trees but formed a more divergent lineage in the n and s gene trees indicative of a recombinant origin additional recombination events were identified in lrlv together these data suggest that rodents may carry additional unrecognized covs

the present study attempted to verify the prevalence of and risk factors for diarrhea-causing agents in dairy calves from brazil additionally ages with a higher risk of occurrence for each agent were verified by means of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve the collections were performed on 39 farms belonging to 29 municipalities located in eight states of brazil it was possible to conclude that the prevalence of coronavirus rotavirus cryptosporidium spp eimeria spp and nematodes was 7.20% 95% ci 4.54-9.78 6.37% 95% ci 3.85-8.89 51.52% 95% ci 45.26-55.57 3.46% 95% ci 2.24-4.67 and 3.46% 95% ci 2.24-4.67 respectively ages with higher probabilities of occurrence of these diseases in calves were < 10 > 8 > 6 > 37 and > 36 days respectively diarrhea occurred more significantly p < 0.0001 in animals less than 21 days old and mainly on those receiving milk through automatic feeders p < 0.001 cryptosporidium spp were a risk factor for the occurrence of rotavirus and vice versa p = 0.0039 and presented a positive correlation with coronavirus p = 0.0089 calves that drink water from rivers streams and ponds had a higher chance of being infected by eimeria spp p < 0.0001 as well as developing infection by nematodes p < 0.0001 the results found in this study highlight the importance of studying the agents of diarrhea together once they act as coinfection where the losses triggered for the owners will involve some of these agents simultaneously
the genomic relationship ofporcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus hev to bovine coronavirus bcv and human coronavirus hcv strain oc43 was examined by dot blot hybridization assays two bcv s gene-specific probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction from the avirulent lg-strain of bcv probes were located in the s1 and the $2 region of the peplomeric s glycoprotein gene the s 1 probe 726 bp hybridized with bcv and hcv-oc43 but not with hev under moderate stringency hybridization conditions 50 °c only slight signals were present with mouse hepatitis virus mhv and no signals were observed with feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv or canine coronavirus ccv at high stringency conditions 60 °c the s1 probe hybridized with bcv only using the $2 probe 680 bp under moderate strin-gency conditions hybridization signals were obtained with bcv hcv-oc43 and hev strains 67n nt9 vw572 the signals obtained by the three hev strains were altogether weaker than with bcv and hcv-oc43 the $2 probe did not react with mhv fipv and ccv at high stringency the s2-specific probe hybridized with bcv and hcv-oc43 but did not hybridize with hev nucleotide sequence analysis of the region covering the s2 probe in hev revealed 92.6% nucleotide sequence homology to bcv and 91.9% to hcv-oc43 in contrast the region covering the s1 probe in hev could not be amplified using the bcv s 1-specific primers the hybridization and sequencing results thus indicate a closer genomic relationship between bcv and hcv-oc43 than there is between hev and bcv or hcv-oc43 respectively
the development of new low cost inactivated polio virus based vaccines ipv is a high priority and will be required to eradicate polio in addition such a vaccine constitutes the only realistic polio vaccine in the post-eradication era one way to reduce the cost of a vaccine is to increase immunogenicity by use of adjuvants the caf01 adjuvant has previously been shown to be a safe and potent adjuvant with several antigens and here we show that in mice ipv formulated with caf01 induced increased systemic protective immunity measured by binding and neutralization antibody titers in serum caf01 also influenced the kinetics of both the cellular and humoral response against ipv to produce a faster as well as a stronger response dominated by igg2a igg2b and igg2c isotypes as well as ipv specific t cells secreting ifn-c/il-2 finally as intestinal immunity is also a priority of polio vaccines we present a vaccine strategy based on simultaneous priming at an intradermal and an intramuscular site that generate intestinal immune responses against polio virus taken together the ipv-caf01 formulation constitutes a new promising vaccine against polio with the ability to generate strong humoral and cellular immunity against the polio virus
aim emerging infectious diseases arising from pathogen spillover from mammals to humans constitute a substantial health threat tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in one health disciplines we assessed patterns of virus sharing among a large diversity of mammals including humans and domestic species location global time period current major taxa studied mammals and associated viruses methods we used network centrality analysis and trait-based bayesian hierarchical models to explore patterns of virus sharing among mammals we analysed a global database that compiled the associations between 1785 virus species and 725 mammalian host species as sourced from automatic screening of meta-data accompanying published nucleotide sequences between 1950 and 2019 results we show that based on current evidence domesticated mammals hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal-virus associations among entire host-virus networks carnivora and chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing rna viruses whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both rna and dna viruses with other host species we revealed strong evidence that dna viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than rna viruses rna viruses exhibited low functional host specificity despite an overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species signifying high potential to shift across hosts with different ecological niches the frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for rna than for dna viruses main conclusions acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change understanding multi-host virus-sharing pathways adds focus to curtail disease spread k e y w o r d s disease emergence disease risk assessment global virus spread host-parasite interaction network analysis pathogen spillover zoonotic disease risk | 471 wells et al
chikungunya virus chikv is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever and has infected millions of people mainly in developing countries the associated disease is characterized by rash high fever and severe arthritis that can persist for years since the epidemic on la réunion in 2006 chikv has adapted to aedes albopictus which also inhabits temperate regions of the eastern and western hemispheres including europe and the united states a albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and chikv would then no longer be confined to the developing nations no treatment or licensed chikv vaccine exists a chikv neutralization assay in a 384-well format by using chikv-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was established this assay system can be used for entry inhibitor screening under a reduced safety level s2 production of chikv-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and the reaction volume are optimized a dose dependent specific neutralization of chikv-pseudotyped vectors with sera of chikv-infected individuals could be measured in a 384-well format a safe and simple multiplex assay for the analysis of chikv neutralizing activities was developed and will be able to improve drug and vaccine development as well as it would improve the understanding of chikv epidemics regarding antibody responses
the ongoing middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreaks pose a worldwide public health threat blocking mers-cov zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels the animal reservoir could potentially reduce the number of primary human cases here we report mers-cov transmission from experimentally infected llamas to naïve animals directly inoculated llamas shed virus for at least 6 days and could infect all in-contact naïve animals 4-5 days after exposure with the aim to block virus transmission we examined the efficacy of a recombinant spike s1-protein vaccine in contrast to naïve animals in-contact vaccinated llamas did not shed infectious virus upon exposure to directly inoculated llamas consistent with the induction of strong virus neutralizing antibody responses our data provide further evidence that vaccination of the reservoir host may impede mers-cov zoonotic transmission to humans
background diarrhea is common in foals but there are no studies investigating the relative prevalence of common infectious agents in a population of hospitalized diarrheic foals objectives to determine the frequency of detection of infectious agents in a population of hospitalized foals with diarrhea and to determine if detection of specific pathogens is associated with age outcome or clinicopathologic data animals two hundred and thirty-three foals 10 months of age with diarrhea examined at a referral institution methods retrospective case series each foal was examined for salmonella spp viruses clostridium difficile toxins clostridium perfringens culture c perfringens enterotoxin cryptosporidium spp and metazoan parasites in feces collected at admission or at the onset of diarrhea results at least 1 infectious agent was detected in 122 foals 55%. rotavirus was most frequently detected 20% followed by c perfringens 18% salmonella spp 12% and c difficile 5%. foals o 1 month of age were significantly more likely to be positive for c perfringens odds ratio 5 15 95% confidence interval 5 3.5-66 or to have negative fecal diagnostic results or 5 3.0 95% ci 5 1.7-5.2 than older foals foals 4 1 month of age were significantly more likely to have salmonella spp or 5 2.6 95% ci 5 1.2-6.0 rotavirus or 5 13.3 95% ci 5 5.3-33 and parasites or 5 23 95% ci 5 3.1-185 detected compared with younger foals overall 191 of the 223 foals 87% survived the type of infectious agent identified in the feces or bacteremia was not significantly associated with survival conclusions and clinical importance in the population studied foals with diarrhea had a good prognosis regardless of which infectious agent was identified in the feces
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is a disease of domestic swine characterized by exceptionally high clinical variability this study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in prrs results from a genetic variation among viral isolates and/or b variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found genetic data open reading frame 5 gene sequences and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 prrs virus prrsv field isolates representing 52 farms clinical disease signs were interrelated ð confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists involving abortions infertility in sows deaths of sows and preweaning mortality pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations also tended to share viral isolates which were more similar to one another than expected by chance alone this implies that sow death one of the more-severe manifestations of prrs is under genetic influence large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs all-in±allout management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd all-in±all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs ð but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows these results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which prrs clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak in general signs associated with prrs appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics the relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question # s 0 1 6 7 -5 8 7 7 9 9 0 0 1 0 4 -x
risk group 4 pathogens are a group of often lethal human viruses for which there are no widely available vaccines or therapeutics these viruses are endemic to specific geographic locations and typically cause relatively infrequent
pathogens originating from wildlife zoonoses pose a significant public health burden 2comprising the majority of emerging infectious diseases efforts to control and prevent 3 zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission or "spillover". 4however in the modern era increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the 5 spread of infected humans non-human animals hereafter animals and their products 6 worldwide thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic 7areas imported zoonoses can potentially 'spill back' to infect local wildlife-a danger 8 magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between 9human and wildlife populations in this way humans can function as vectors dispersing 10 zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel 11animal host populations once established these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by 12 standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics understanding 13 when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling 14 ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis the human 15 population and the natural ecosystem we address this challenge by delineating potential 16 ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment-wildlife exposure 17 enzootic infection and persistence-applying existing ecological concepts from 18 epidemiology invasion biology and population ecology we ground our study in the 19 neotropics where four arthropod-borne viruses arboviruses of zoonotic origin-yellow 20 fever dengue chikungunya and zika viruses-have separately been introduced into the 21 human population this paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and 22preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations 23 24
gastrointestinal viruses predominantly rotaviruses and adenoviruses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay electron microscopy or cell culture in >50070 of two groups of homosexual men with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection who did 54070 or did not 50070 have diarrhea lower detection rates were observed in hiv-seronegative 15070 and asymptomatic hiv-seropositive 16070 men in the patients with diarrhea 95070 of the isolates of virus were found in the most immunosuppressed patients those patients with aids-related complex or opportunistic infections associated with aids high excretion rates of these viruses are probably associated with both anal-oral transmission and immunosuppression these viruses apparently cause acute episodes or relapses of diarrhea in some patients but may be co-pathogens or noncontributory to chronic diarrhea in others diarrhea is a common complication of aids both in africa and in western countries healthy homosexual men who are seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus hiv often present with enteritis colitis and proctitis caused by a wide variety of viruses bacteria and parasites and this spectrum is broadened further if these men develop aids the principal pathogens responsible for chronic diarrhea in patients with aids are cryptosporidium isospora atypical mycobacteria associated with a whipple's type syndrome salmonella and cytomegalovirus cmv kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma may also involve the gut and thus cause diarrhea we and others have however often observed both acute self-limited diarrhea and chronic diarrhea with malabsorption in patients with aids persistent generalized lymphadenopathy pgl or aids-related complex arc and could not determine bacterial
the complete genome of hepatitis e virus hev from laboratory ferrets imported from the united states was identified this virus shared only 82.4%-82.5% nt sequence identities with strains from the netherlands which indicated that the ferret hev genome is genetically diverse some laboratory ferrets were contaminated with hev
immunomics research uses in silico epitope prediction as well as in vivo and in vitro approaches we inoculated balb/c h2 d mice with 17dd yellow fever vaccine to investigate the correlations between approaches used for epitope discovery elispot assays binding assays and prediction software our results showed a good agreement between elispot and binding assays which seemed to correlate with the protein immunogenicity pred balb/c prediction software partially agreed with the elispot and binding assay results but presented low specificity the use of prediction software to exclude peptides containing no epitopes followed by high throughput screening of the remaining peptides by elispot and the use of mhc-biding assays to characterize the mhc restrictions demonstrated to be an efficient strategy the results allowed the characterization of 2 mhc class i and 17 class ii epitopes in the envelope protein of the yf virus in balb/c h2 d mice

the aim of this study was molecular identification of cryptosporidium species and assessment of their prevalence in different breeds of sheep and goat reared in poland in addition the relationship between animal age breed type and the frequency of cryptosporidium infections was determined fecal samples from 234 lambs and 105 goat kids aged up to 9 weeks representing 24 breeds and their cross-breeds were collected from 71 small ruminant farms across poland the identification of cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18 ssu ribosomal rna rrna and cowp loci followed by subtyping of c parvum and c hominis strains at gp60 gene locus the presence of cryptosporidium dna at the 18 ssu rrna locus was detected in 45/234 19.2% lamb feces samples and in 39/105 37.1% taken from goats the following cryptosporidium species c xiaoi c bovis c ubiquitum c parvum and c hominis were detected in small ruminants infections caused by c xiaoi were predominant without favoring any tested animal species subsequent gp60 subtyping revealed the presence of c parvum iiaa17g1r1 subtype in sheep and iida23g1 subtype in goats iida23g1 subtype was detected in a goat host for the first time there were no significant differences found in frequency of infections between the age groups <3 and 3-9 weeks of lambs p = 0.14 α > 0.05 or goat kids p = 0.06 α > 0.05 in addition there was no correlation observed between the frequency in occurrence of particular parasite species and breed type in relation to native sheep breeds f = 0.11 p = 0.990 > 0.05 in the case of goats more breed-related differences in parasite occurrence were found the results of this study improve our knowledge on the breedrelated occurrence of cryptosporidium infections in the population of small ruminants reared in poland
there is now an overwhelming body of evidence that implicates bats in the dissemination of a long list of emerging and reemerging viral agents often causing illnesses or death in both animals and humans despite this there is a paucity of information regarding the immunological mechanisms by which bats coexist with highly pathogenic viruses immunoglobulins are major components of the adaptive immune system early studies found bats may have quantitatively lower antibody responses to model antigens compared to conventional laboratory animals to further understand the antibody response of bats the present study purified and characterised the major immunoglobulin classes from healthy black flying foxes pteropus alecto we employed a novel strategy where igg was initially purified and used to generate anti-fab specific antibodies immobilised anti-fab specific antibodies were then used to capture other immunoglobulins from igg depleted serum while high quantities of igm were successfully isolated from serum iga was not only trace quantities of iga were detected in the serum by mass spectrometry immobilised ligands specific to iga jacalin peptide m and staphylococcal superantigen-like protein also failed to capture p alecto iga from serum igm was the second most abundant serum antibody after igg a survey of mucosal secretions found igg was the dominant antibody class rather than iga our study demonstrates healthy p alecto bats have markedly less serum iga than expected higher quantities of igg in mucosal secretions may be compensation for this low abundance or lack of iga knowledge and reagents developed within this study can be used in the future to examine class-specific antibody response within this important viral host
human adenovirus type 4 hadv-e4 which is intriguingly limited to military populations causes acute respiratory disease with demonstrated morbidity and mortality implications this respiratory pathogen contains genome identity with chimpanzee adenoviruses indicating zoonotic origins a signature of these "old" hadv-e4 is the absence of a critical replication motif nf-i which is found in all hadv respiratory pathogens and most hadvs however our recent survey of flu-like disease in children in hong kong reveals that the emergent hadv-e4 pathogens circulating in civilian populations contain nf-i indicating recombination and reflecting host-adaptation that enables the "new" hadv-e4 to replicate more efficiently in human cells and foretells more potential hadv-e4 outbreaks in immune-naïve civilian populations special attention should be paid by clinicians to this emergent and recombinant hadv-e4 circulating in civilian populations
dromedary camels are natural host of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov however there are limited studies of mers-cov infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dromedaries we expanded our surveillance among camels in egypt tunisia and senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camels a total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle sheep goats donkeys buffaloes mules and horses were collected swabs were tested using rt-pcr and virus rna-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera where available were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests prnt we detected 90% prnt confirmed mers-cov antibody in 35 55.6% of 63 sera from sheep collected from senegal two sheep 1.8% of 114 in tunisia and a goat 0.9% of 107 in egypt with titres ranging from 180 to ≥1320 we detected mers-cov rna in swabs from three sheep 1.2% of 254 and five goats 4.1% of 121 from egypt and senegal as well as one cow 1.9% of 53 and three donkeys 7.1% of 42 from egypt partial sequences of the rt-pcr amplicons confirmed specificity of the results this study showed that domestic livestock in contact with mers-cov infected camels may be at risk of infection we recommend expanding current mers-cov surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dromedary camels the segregation of camels from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered we carried out 17 sampling visits to mixed farms or herds where camels and other livestock were raised in senegal and egypt and a livestock market in tunisia
haematology antibody titers and serum protein electrophoresis from 48 cats 34 effusive and 14 noneffusive forms affected with feline infectious peritonitis fip were studied and compared with those of 20 healthy cats in the effusive form antibody titers and protein electrophoresis in the effusions were analyzed the distribution of the immune cells and of the virus in fip lesions were also investigated immunohistochemically with the avidin±biotin complex abc method using antibodies against the fip virus fipv myelomonocytic mac387 and lymphoid cd3 cd4 and cd8 for t-cells and igm and igg for b-cells antigens seropositive animals antibody titer>1100 were present among both the fip infected cats 73% and the healthy cats 70%. cats with effusive fip had neutrophilic leukocytosis p>0.05 lymphopenia p<0.01 and eosinopenia p<0.001 in both effusive and noneffusive forms decreased albumin/globulin ratio p<0.001 with hypoalbuminemia p<0.001 hyperglobulinemia p<0.001 and increased 2 -p<0.05 -p<0.05 and gglobulins p<0.001 were found hypergammaglobulinemia was not related to the antibody titers suggesting the presence of other proteins with g-motility e g complement fractions the electrophoretic pattern of the effusions was always similar to that of the corresponding serum antibody titers higher than those of the corresponding serum were often detected in the effusions immunohistochemical findings were not related to the antibody titers but they were related to the histological aspect of the lesions in cellular foci of fip lesions many virus-infected macrophages and few lymphocytes mainly cd4 were found extracellular viral and myelomonocytic antigens were also detectable in the foci with intercellular necrosis only few fipv-infected cells were present at the periphery of the larger necrotic foci in these lesions mac387 cells were mainly neutrophils with many mac387 à macrophages probably due to their activated state a small number of lymphocytes with an increasing percentage of cd8 cells was present lymphocytes were more abundant when cellular foci and fip-infected macrophages were centered around neoformed vessels igm and igg exposing b-cells were always few and scattered in conclusion the simultaneous analysis of body fluids and of the cellular composition of the lesions showed a veterinary immunology and immunopathology 65 1998 205±220 s 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 9 8 0 0 1 5 5 -x complex immune status on which type iii and type iv hypersensitivity could coexist # 1998 elsevier science b v all rights reserved
the tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumor disease dftd while research on dftd has been extensive little is known about viruses in devils and whether any are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species using both metagenomics based on virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics based on bulk rna sequencing we characterized and compared the fecal viromes of captive and wild devils a total of 54 fecal samples collected from two captive and four wild populations were processed for virome characterization using both approaches in total 24 novel marsupial-related viruses comprising a sapelovirus astroviruses rotaviruses picobirnaviruses parvoviruses papillomaviruses polyomaviruses and a gammaherpesvirus were identified as well as known mammalian pathogens such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 captive devils showed significantly lower viral diversity than wild devils comparison of the two virus discovery approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected with metatranscriptomics better suited for rna viruses and virion-enriched metagenomics largely identifying more dna viruses thus the viral communities revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present an integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics constitutes a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities within a sample importance the tasmanian devil is an iconic australian marsupial that has suffered an 80% population decline due to a contagious cancer devil facial tumor disease along with other threats until now viral discovery in this species has been confined to one gammaherpesvirus dasyurid herpesvirus 2 for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor our discovery of 24 novel marsupial-associated rna and dna viruses and that viral diversity is lower in captive than in wild devils has greatly expanded our knowledge of gut-associated viruses in devils and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species our results also revealed that a combination of virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach for virome characterization than either method alone our results thus provide a springboard for continuous improvements in the way we study complex viral communities
the bat paramyxovirus b16-40 was first isolated in korea in this study using the isolated virus we could obtain not only genomic information but also several biological characteristics of the virus in the phylogenetic analysis the virus was found to belong to the recently proposed genus shaanvirus through sequence analyses and in vitro testing the isolated virus was also found to have haemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn protein as one of the structural proteins when mouse antiserum was generated against the isolated virus and tested it was cross-reactive to human parainfluenza virus 1 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay but could not cross-neutralize human parainfluenza virus 1 in addition the bat paramyxovirus b16-40 was not infectious in the mouse model collectively this study provided basic information on further classification of the bat paramyxovirus b16-40 and related viruses in the proposed genus shaanvirus
to characterize the antigenicity of nucleocapsid proteins np derived from canine coronavirus ccov and canine respiratory coronavirus crcov in china the n genes of ccov ccov-bj70 and crcov crcov-bj202 were cloned from swabs obtained from diseased pet dogs in beijing and then sequenced the recombinant nps rnps were expressed in escherichia coli and purified by nickel-affinity column and size exclusion chromatography sequencing data indicated that the n genes of ccov-bj70 and crcov-bj202 belonging to two distinctly different groups were relatively conserved within each subgroup sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page results showed that rnps of ccov and crcov were expressed efficiently and isolated with a final purity of over 95%. western blot analysis revealed the rnp from crcov could cross-react with mice antisera against human coronavirus hcov-229e nl63 oc43 hku1 while rnp of ccov had cross-reactivity with only anti-sera against viruses belonging to the same group hcov-229e and nl63 in summary ccov and crcov rnps were successfully expressed in e coli and showed antigenic cross-reactivity with antisera raised against human coronaviruses these findings indicate that further serologic studies on coronavirus infections at the animal-human interface are needed canine coronavirus canine respiratory coronavirus nucleocapsid protein expression cross-reactivity citation
a potymerase chain reaction pcr based assay capable of detecting and differentiating seven strains of equine arteritis virus eav from around the world was developed the primers for the pcr were chosen from the orf 6 gene encoding the unglycosylated membrane protein m viral rna from cell culture fluids infected with each of the seven eav strains and rna from the live vaccine arvac was detected by pcr using four sets of primers the sensitivity of detection was increased from 100 to 1000 times by performing nested pcr enabling the detection of rna at a level of 0.5-5 pfu differentiation among the virus strains and the live vaccine was achieved by cutting the pcr-amplified products from three sets of primers with six restriction endonucleases using this procedure it was possible to distinguish among the seven eav strains used the equine arteritis virus eav has been classified as a member of the togaviridae family . however recently eav has been found to resemble the coronavirus and torovirus in its genome organization and gene expression strategy yet differing from them in virion genome size and virion morphology therefore eav may be a member of a recently proposed new family of viruses the arteriviridae consisting of the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus . the clinical signs of equine viral arteritis are very variable and subclinical infections are the most common sequel . to date a single serotype has been recognized and no major antigenic variation has been demonstrated among eav isolated from disparatechronological and geographic origins . murphy et al showed high
since the beginning of the 1980s 33 emerging tick-borne agents have been identified in mainland china including eight species of spotted fever group rickettsiae seven species in the family anaplasmataceae six genospecies in the complex borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato 11 species of babesia and the virus causing severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in this review we have mapped the geographical distributions of human cases of infection 15 of the 33 emerging tick-borne agents have been reported to cause human disease and their clinical characteristics have been described the non-specific clinical manifestations caused by tick-borne pathogens present a major diagnostic challenge and most physicians are unfamiliar with the many tick-borne diseases that present with non-specific symptoms in the early stages of the illness advances in and application of modern molecular techniques should help with identification of emerging tickborne pathogens and improve laboratory diagnosis of human infections we expect that more novel tick-borne infections in ticks and animals will be identified and additional emerging tickborne diseases in human beings will be discovered among the 33 newly recognised tick-associated agents 15 have been reported to cause human infection including four species of sfgr 11354648 an ehrlichia species 53 two anaplasma species 1753 and candidatus n mikurensis 18 three genospecies of b burgdorferi sensu lato 192178 three species of babesia 33104108 and sftsv table 2 34 six of the tickborne pathogens were first identified in febrile patients candidatus rickettsia tarasevichiae candidatus n mikurensis borrelia garinii borrelia afzelii babesia venatorum and sftsv and then shown to be associated with ticks table 1 . the other nine human pathogens were initially detected in ticks or animals and subsequently fang et al
in order to evaluate the prevalence of isospora suis in conventional piglet production in germany pooled faecal samples from 327 pig litters from 18 pig production units 20-320 sows each were examined at least 10 litters from each farm were investigated i suis was present on 83% of the farms and 42.5% of the litters the infection rate being highest in the third week of age 48.2%. i suis was found more frequently in samples of diarrhoea than in firm faeces 49.2% compared to 22.2%. twenty naturally infected piglets from six of these farms underwent examination post mortem including histology virology and bacteriology histological examination revealed atrophy of the villi in various degrees mild crypt hyperplasia fusion of the villi metaplastic epithelium erosions and necrosis especially in the medium and the posterior jejunum and in the ileum asexual and sexual developmental stages of the parasite were found in varying numbers in the epithelium of the whole of the small intestine bacteria and viruses were mostly excluded as the cause of diarrhoea and it was concluded that i suis was the primary pathogen inducing distinct changes and clinical symptoms of diarrhoea
nipah virus niv is a member of the genus henipavirus family paramyxoviridae that causes severe and often lethal respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates up to 92%. niv can cause acute lung injury ali in humans and human-to-human transmission has been observed in recent outbreaks of niv while the exact route of transmission to humans is not known we have previously shown that niv can efficiently infect human respiratory epithelial cells the molecular mechanisms of niv-associated ali in the human respiratory tract are unknown thus there is an urgent need for models of henipavirus infection of the human respiratory tract to study the pathogenesis and understand the host responses here we describe a novel human lung xenograft model in mice to study the pathogenesis of niv following transplantation human fetal lung xenografts rapidly graft and develop mature structures of adult lungs including cartilage vascular vessels ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium and primitive ''air'' spaces filled with mucus and lined by cuboidal to flat epithelium following infection niv grows to high titers 10 7 tcid 50 /gram lung tissue as early as 3 days post infection pi niv targets both the endothelium as well as respiratory epithelium in the human lung tissues and results in syncytia formation niv infection in the human lung results in the production of several cytokines and chemokines including il-6 ip-10 eotaxin g-csf and gm-csf on days 5 and 7 pi in conclusion this study demonstrates that niv can replicate to high titers in a novel in vivo model of the human respiratory tract resulting in a robust inflammatory response which is known to be associated with ali this model will facilitate progress in the fundamental understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions it will also provide biologically relevant models for other respiratory viruses
several serological interrelationships between various members of the coronavirus group have been revealed in neutralization complement fixation and geldiffusion tests using human and hyperimmune animal sera several members of this group of human and animal pathogens are shown to cross-react in one or more type of test but one member avian infectious bronchitis virus was shown to be unrelated mouse hepatitis virus mhvs was found to be antigenieally related to a number of human types of coronavirus difficulties were encountered in the investigation of paired human sera in demonstrating the specificity of antibody rises placing doubt on the values of some serological studies the significance of these interrelationships is discussed in the light of other investigations bradburne antigenic relationships amongst coronaviruses 353 organ cultures of human embryo nasal and tracheal epithelium these isolates comprise at least three and probably more distinct serological types as judged by neutralization tests using convalescent human sera b~a] bur~ and t~r~iil 1969 mci~tos~ et al 1969 this work describes the detection of several serological relationships between the viruses isolated from man and those of mouse hepatitis and avian infectious bronchitis the majority of these results were obtained before similar studies were reported by mcintos~ et al 1969 furthermore different reagents were used and several extra cross-reactions were detected.2.1 tissue cultures these were all propagated in this laboratory roller tube neutralization tests were performed in monolayer cultures of human embryo diploid lung cells hdcs these were either a strain derived at the unit or the wi-38 cell strain plaque neutralization tests were made using monolayers of l 132 cells in 50 mm plastic pctri dishes sterilin the l 132 cell line is a continuous epitheloid cell line which was derived from human embryo lung davis 1960 and has been shown to be sensitive to several respiratory viruses including 4 strains of coronaviruses brad-]~vl~n]~ 1969 all cultures were maintained at 33~ after inoculation
the aim of this study was to use iedb software to predict the suitable mers-cov epitope vaccine against the most known world population alleles through four selecting proteins such as s glycoprotein and envelope protein and their modification sequences after the pandemic spread of mers-cov in 2012 iedb services is one of the computational methods the output of this study showed that s glycoprotein envelope e protein and s and e protein modified sequences of mers-cov might be considered as a protective immunogenic with high conservancy because they can elect both neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses when reacting with b-cell t-helper cell and cytotoxic t lymphocyte netctl netchop and mhc-np were used to confirm our results population coverage analysis showed that the putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes could cover most of the world population in more than 60 geographical regions according to allerhunter results all those selected different protein showed non-allergen this finding makes this computational vaccine study more desirable for vaccine synthesis
the frequency of moderate to severe adverse reactions associated with smallpox vaccines currently stockpiled in the us and the continued threat of bioterrorism have prompted the development of effective vaccines with improved safety profiles lc16m8 an attenuated replicating smallpox vaccine derived from the lister strain of vaccinia is currently licensed in japan where it was safely used in over 50000 children in the 1970s it has been shown to have markedly less neurotoxicity than unattenuated vaccines in nonclinical studies lc16m8 is immunogenic after a single dose and recent studies in two different animal models have demonstrated protective efficacy equivalent to that of the only fdalicensed smallpox vaccine this article reviews the history and available scientific literature regarding lc16m8 and provides comparisons to other smallpox vaccines
in this research we developed a novel chimeric htnv-il-2-g2 dna vaccine plasmid by genetically linking il-2 gene to the g2 segment dna and tested whether it could be a candidate vaccine chimeric gene was first expressed in eukaryotic expression system pcdna3.1 +. the htnv-il-2-g2 expressed a 72 kda fusion protein in cos-7 cells meanwhile the fusion protein kept the activity of its parental proteins furthermore balb/c mice were vaccinated by the chimeric gene elisa cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized balb/c mice lymphocyte proliferation assay was used to detect the cellular immune response.-the results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously evoke specific antibody against g2 glycoprotein and il-2 and the immunized mice of every group elicited neutralizing antibodies with different titers lymphocyte proliferation assay results showed that the stimulation indexes of splenocytes of chimeric gene to g2 and il-2 were significantly higher than that of other groups our results suggest that il-2-based htnv g2 dna can induce both humoral and cellular immune response specific for htnv g2 and can be a candidate dna vaccine for htnv infection
2013 from 2014 outbreaks were also reported from central europe to characterize the central european pedv strains regarding their virulence in suckling piglets and to assess the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies mda four trial groups were randomly assigned each consisting of two pregnant sows and their litter to induce mda in a subset of piglets two sows received a cell culture-adapted pedv strain and another two sows were inoculated with field material from german ped outbreaks four sows stayed naïve subsequently all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding pedv strains at an age of 3 to 6 days and virus shedding clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed piglets without mda showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality while almost all mda-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding taken together the central european pedv strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring the latter is the prerequisite for a sow vaccination concept that could help to prevent ped induced losses in the piglet sector porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine affecting pigs of all ages severe clinical signs and high mortality rates are especially observed in suckling piglets and severity of disease decreases with age however strain virulence and management conditions also impact on the clinical disease and outcome 1-3 .the disease is mainly characterized by watery diarrhea and vomiting which leads to dehydration and deteriorating constitution the causative agent is ped virus pedv an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus of the genus alphacoronavirus within the coronaviridae virus family of the order nidovirales 4 .porcine epidemic diarrhea first emerged in 1971 in england termed epidemic diarrhea ed 5 6 . these early outbreaks were characterized by severe clinical signs and mortality rates of up to 100% in young fattening pigs in the beginning no cases were reported from suckling pigs later on pigs of all ages showed similar disease in different european countries and over the following years ped was reported from belgium
