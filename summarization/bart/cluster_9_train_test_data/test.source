pohjola s oksanen h neuvonen e veijalainen p and henriksson k 1986 certain enteropathogens in calves of finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of diarrhea prey vet med 3 547--558 the occurrence and distribution of certain enteropathogenic organisms and the manifestation of diarrhea especially in relation to colostral management were studied in neonatal calves of eight southern finnish dairy herds with recurrent outbreaks of enteric disturbances the fecal samples were obtained from the calves and were provided by the farmers potentially pathogenic agents were demonstrated in 52 of the 68 calves studied cryptosporidium was found in 36 of them while rotavirus was found in 29 and escherichin coli in 15 of them either singly or in combination salmonella coronavirus or parvovirus were not detected in any of the calves twenty-six of the 36 calves contracted their cryptosporidium infection and 18 of the 29 calves their rotavirus infection within the first week of life eighteen of the 52 infected calves developed diarrhea of microbial origin within 20 days of age the most frequent finding was mixed infection with cryptosporidium and rotavirus in addition there were six diarrheic calves where no infection could be demonstrated only 10 of the 68 calves had neither infections nor diarrhea there was a highly significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the uninfected non-diarrheic and diarrheic calves and a significant difference between the mean times of the first colostral feeding of the subclinically infected and diarrheic calves the importance of sucking of colostrum at the first feeding was observed the smallest amount protecting the calves from infections was 0.75 1 given within 1 h of delivery
clinical progress in the field of her2-positive breast cancer therapy has been dramatically improved by understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms of tumor microenvironment passive immunotherapy utilizing recombinant monoclonal antibodies mabs particularly trastuzumab and pertuzumab has proved to be an effective strategy in her2-positive breast cancer treatment however resistance to mab therapy and relapse of disease are still considered important challenges in clinical practice there are increasing reports on the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses in her2-positive breast cancer patients more recently increasing efforts are focused on using her2-derived peptide vaccines for active immunotherapy here we discuss the development of various her2-derived vaccines tested in animal models and human clinical trials different formulations and strategies to improve immunogenicity of the antigens in animal studies are also discussed furthermore other immunotherapeutic approaches to her2 breast cancer including ctla-4 inhibitors immune checkpoint inhibitors anti pd-1/pd-l1 antibodies are presented
bats are connected with the increasing numbers of emerging and re-emerging viruses that may break the species barrier and spread into the human population coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats which were considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses i e sars-cov and mers-cov our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10 named as ro-batcov gccdc1 in this report through a two-year follow-up of a special bat population in one specific cave of south china we illustrate that ro-batcov gccdc1 persistently circulates among bats notably through the longitudinal observation we identified the dynamic evolution of ro-batcov gccdc1 in bats represented by continuously recombination events our study provides the first glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warning of potential interspecies transmittable viruses in bats citation
members of family coronaviridae cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev a lesserresearched coronavirus can infect naive pigs of any age but clinical disease is observed in pigs յ4 weeks of age no commercial phev vaccines are available and neonatal protection from phev-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity although subclinical phev infections are thought to be common phev ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown to begin to address this gap in knowledge a serum igg antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the s1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate phev seroprevalence in u s sow herds assessment of the diagnostic performance of the phev s1 elisa using serum samples n ϭ 924 collected from 7-week-old pigs n ϭ 84 12 pigs per group inoculated with phev porcine epidemic diarrhea virus transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine respiratory coronavirus or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of ն0.6 was both sensitive and specific i e all phev-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42 and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups the phev s1 elisa was then used to estimate phev seroprevalence in u s sow herds 19 states using 2756 serum samples from breeding females ͼ28 weeks old on commercial farms n ϭ 104 with no history of phev-associated disease the overall seroprevalence was 53.35% confidence interval ϯ1.86% and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% ci ϯ3.70%. importance there is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev in commercial swine herds this study provided evidence that phev infection is endemic and highly prevalent in u s swine herds these results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic phev on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations regardless the availability of the validated phev s1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor phev infections confirm prior exposure to the virus and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds
elicitation of antibodies with potent and broad neutralizing activity against hiv by immunization remains a challenge several monoclonal antibodies mabs isolated from humans with hiv-1 infection exhibit such activity but vaccine immunogens based on structures containing their epitopes have not been successful for their elicitation all known broadly neutralizing mabs bnmabs are immunoglobulin ig gs iggs and highly somatically hypermutated which could impede their elicitation ig ms igms are on average significantly less divergent from germline antibodies and are relevant for the development of vaccine immunogens but are underexplored compared to iggs here we describe the identification and characterization of several human igm-derived mabs against hiv-1 which were selected from a large phage-displayed naive human antibody library constructed from blood lymph nodes and spleens of 59 healthy donors these antibodies bound with high affinity to recombinant envelope glycoproteins gp140s envs of hiv-1 isolates from different clades they enhanced or did not neutralize infection by some of the hiv-1 primary isolates using ccr5 as a coreceptor but neutralized all cxcr4 isolates tested although weakly one of these antibodies with relatively low degree of somatic hypermutation was more extensively characterized it bound to a highly conserved regionviruses 2010 2 548 partially overlapping with the coreceptor binding site and close to but not overlapping with the cd4 binding site these results suggest the existence of conserved structures that could direct the immune response to non-neutralizing or even enhancing antibodies which may represent a strategy used by the virus to escape neutralizing immune responses further studies will show whether such a strategy plays a role in hiv infection of humans how important that role could be and what the mechanisms of infection enhancement are the newly identified mabs could be used as reagents to further characterize conserved nonneutralizing weakly neutralizing or enhancing epitopes and modify or remove them from candidate vaccine immunogens
bats are being increasingly recognized as reservoir hosts of highly pathogenic and zoonotic emerging viruses marburg virus nipah virus hendra virus rabies virus and coronaviruses while numerous studies have focused on the mentioned highly human-pathogenic bat viruses in tropical regions little is known on similar human-pathogenic viruses that may be present in european bats although novel viruses are being detected their zoonotic potential remains unclear unless further studies are conducted at present it is assumed that the risk posed by bats to the general public is rather low in this review selected viruses detected and isolated in europe are discussed from our point of view in regard to their human-pathogenic potential all european bat species and their roosts are legally protected and some european species are even endangered nevertheless the increasing public fear of bats and their viruses is an obstacle to their protection educating the public regarding bat lyssaviruses might result in reduced threats to both the public and the bats
a novel avian influenza a h7n9 virus recently emerged in the yangtze river delta and caused diseases often severe in over 130 people this h7n9 virus appeared to infect humans with greater ease than previous avian infl uenza virus subtypes such as h5n1 and h9n2 while there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus we investigated whether a lack of conserved t-cell epitopes between endemic h1n1 and h3n2 infl uenza viruses and the novel h7n9 virus contributes to this observation here we demonstrate that a number of t cell epitopes are conserved between endemic h1n1 and h3n2 viruses and h7n9 virus most of these conserved epitopes are from viral internal proteins the extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal infl uenza and avian infl uenza h7n9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza h5n1 thus the ease of inter-species transmission of h7n9 viruses compared with avian h5n1 viruses cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such t cell epitopes on the contrary our fi ndings predict signifi cant t-cell based cross-reactions in the human population to the novel h7n9 virus our findings also have implications for h7n9 virus vaccine design
background severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov is a newly emerging virus that causes sars with high mortality rate in infected people successful control of the global sars epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread as well as the development of vaccines and new antiviral compounds including neutralizing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease the human synthetic single-chain fragment variable scfv eth-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scfvs against the nucleocapsid n protein of sars-cov using a bio panning-based strategy the selected scfvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for sars-cov n protein detection in elisa western blotting and immunocytochemistry results human scfv antibodies to n protein of sars-cov can be easily isolated by selecting the eth-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen these in vitro selected human scfvs specifically recognize in elisa and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in n protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations sars-cov particles in infected vero cells the human scfv antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful reagents for rapid detection of n sars-cov protein and sars virus particles in infected target cells

a sudden outbreak of epidemic diarrhoea of piglets occurred in japan the principal features being watery diarrhoea dehydration and high mortality in newborn animals the microscopical lesions were villous atrophy in the small intestine the villous enterocytes being vacuolated and cuboidal in shape the villus-crypt ratio was severely reduced varying from 1 1 to 31 transmission electron microscopy showed numerous coronaviruses within the cytoplasm of enterocytes and among microvilli specific antigens of porcine epidemic diarrhoea ped virus were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes by the streptavidin-biotin sab technique infected cells which were most abundant in the villous epithelia of the jejunum and ileum were present in small numbers in the large intestine the crypt epithelia the lamina propria and peyer's patches the study suggests that the sab technique is useful for the diagnosis of ped
canine enteric coronavirus ccov is an alphacoronavirus infecting dogs that is closely related to enteric coronaviruses of cats and pigs while ccov has traditionally caused mild gastro-intestinal clinical signs there are increasing reports of lethal ccov infections in dogs with evidence of both gastrointestinal and systemic viral dissemination consequently ccov is now considered to be an emerging infectious disease of dogs in addition to the two known serotypes of ccov novel recombinant variants of ccov have been found containing spike protein n-terminal domains ntds that are closely related to those of feline and porcine strains the increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel ccovs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one ccov type in the same host
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec strains are the main cause of diarrhea in pigs pig diarrhea especially post-weaning diarrhea remains one of the most important swine diseases etec bacterial fimbriae including k88 f18 987p k99 and f41 promote bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate etec colonization in pig small intestine etec enterotoxins including heat-labile toxin lt and heat-stable toxins type ia porcine-type sta and type ii stb stimulate fluid hyper-secretion leading to watery diarrhea blocking bacteria colonization and/or neutralizing enterotoxicity of etec toxins are considered effective prevention against etec diarrhea in this study we applied the mefa multiepitope fusion antigen strategy to create toxoid mefas that carried antigenic elements of etec toxins and examined for broad antitoxin immunogenicity in a murine model by embedding sta toxoid sta p12f ntfyccelccnfacagcy a stb epitope kkdlcehy and an epitope of stx2e a subunit qsyvssln into the a1 peptide of a monomeric lt toxoid lt r192g two toxoid mefas 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-sta p12f ' and 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-3xsta p12f ' which carried three copies of sta p12f were constructed mice intraperitoneally immunized with each toxoid mefa developed igg antibodies to all four toxins induced antibodies showed in vitro neutralizing activities against lt sta stb and stx2e toxins moreover suckling piglets born by a gilt immunized with 'lt r192g -stb-stx2e-3xsta p12f ' were protected when challenged with etec strains whereas piglets born by a control gilt developed diarrhea results from this study showed that the toxoid mefa induced broadly antitoxin antibodies and suggested potential application of the toxoid mefa for developing a broad-spectrum vaccine against etec diarrhea in pigs
to combat variola virus in bioterrorist attacks it is desirable to develop a noninvasive vaccine based on the vaccinia tiantan vtt strain which was historically used to eradicate the smallpox in china we generated a modified vtt mvtt zci by removing the hemagglutinin gene and an 11944 bp genomic region from hindiii fragment c2l to f3l mvtt zci was characterized for its host cell range in vitro and preclinical safety and efficacy profiles in mice despite replication-competency in some cell lines unlike vtt mvtt zci did not cause death after intracranial injection or body weight loss after intranasal inoculation mvtt zci did not replicate in mouse brain and was safe in immunodeficient mice mvtt zci induced neutralizing antibodies via the intranasal route of immunization one time intranasal immunization protected animals from the challenge of the pathogenic vaccinia wr strain this study established proof-of-concept that the attenuated replicating mvtt zci may serve as a safe noninvasive smallpox vaccine candidate
infection with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness therefore the prevalence of mers-cov infections in the general population could be underestimated which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-mers-cov antibodies in high-and low-risk groups in qatar a total of 4858 samples were screened including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors bd over a period of five years 2012-2016 135 samples from baseline case contacts cc collected from individuals in close contact with three positive pcr-confirmed patients cp and four samples from mers-cov cp initial screening using anti-mers-cov igg igg rs1-elisa kit revealed ten reactive samples from bd 10/4719 0.21% one from cc 1/135 0.74% and three from cp 3/4 75%. samples from cp but not from bd were also reactive by whole-virus anti-mers-cov igg n = 3/4 and igm n = 1/4 indirect immunefluorescent tests iift and pseudoparticle neutralization test ppnt the reactive sample from cc was also confirmed by ppnt surprisingly one out of thirteen 7.7% randomly selected igg rs1-elisa-negative bd samples from the initial screening was reactive by the igm-iift but not by the igg-iift and was subsequently confirmed by ppnt all igg rs1-elisa-reactive samples from bd exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses hku1 oc43 229e and nl63 cross-reactivity with sars was only reported for samples from cp using igg and igm-iift in conclusion we report a low prevalence of anti-mers antibodies in the general population which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study 2017 in qatar n = 21 the false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between mers-cov and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic disease seen exclusively in humans central nervous system cns infection and neurological involvement have also been reported in cchf in the current study we inoculated nsg-sgm3 mice engrafted with human hematopoietic cd34 + stem cells with low-passage cchf virus strains isolated from human patients in humanized mice lethal disease develops characterized by histopathological change in the liver and brain to date targets of neurological infection and disease have not been investigated in cchf cns disease in humanized mice was characterized by gliosis meningitis and meningoencephalitis and glial cells were identified as principal targets of infection humanized mice represent a novel lethal model for studies of cchf countermeasures and cchf-associated cns disease our data suggest a role for astrocyte dysfunction in neurological disease and identify key regions of infection in the cns for future investigations of cchf
faecal specimens from 60 patients under six years old most of whom were maoris and pacific islanders admitted to auckland hospital with gastroenteritis during the months of june and july 1977 were examined for the presence of faecal viruses bacterial pathogens and parasites faecal specimens from 18 non-diarrhoeal control patients were also examined of which three contained rotavirus forty-three 72 per cent gastroenteritis patients had rotavirus detectable in stools by electron microscopy or immune electron microscopy of the remainder 17 patients were regarded as having non-rotavirus diarrhoea enterotoxigenic esch coli was isolated from seven patients of whom six yielded stable toxin producers st+ four labile toxin producers lt+ and two dual toxigenic strains st+/lt+. all st+ isolates appeared to be of low enterotoxigenicity as indicated by low gut weight/carcass weight ratios in the infant mouse assay rotavirus was the commonest aetiological agent 72 per cent bacterial pathogens alone accounted for only five per cent and no enteric pathogens were found in 15 per cent of cases non-agglutinable rotavirus presumably a different serotype was seen in both gastroenteritis and control patients rotavirus 'satellite' particles previously undescribed were demonstrated in a number of stool samples

farm animals are sources of meat milk and eggs for the humans and animal health ensures the quality and security of these agricultural and sideline products the animal raising conditions in livestock stations and poultry houses play vital roles in both animal health and production one of the major factors affecting raising conditions relative humidity has not received much attention even though it is important for animal husbandry in this review we summarize the impacts of relative humidity on animal health and welfare to draw attention for its importance in the improvement of animal raising conditions in the future
hantaviruses are emerging rna viruses that cause human diseases predominantly in asia europe and the americas besides rodents insectivores and bats serve as hantavirus reservoirs we report the detection and genome characterization of a novel bat-borne hantavirus isolated from insectivorous common noctule bat the newfound virus was tentatively named as brno virus
this study was carried out to evaluate the vaccination effect of a virus-like particle vlp including the surface antigen 1 sag1 of toxoplasma gondii as a potential vaccine for toxoplasmosis the sag1 virus-like particles sag1-vlps were expressed by sf9 cells and their expression was confirmed through cloning rt-pcr analysis and western blot method the immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of sag1-vlps were assessed by the antibody response cytokine analysis neutralization activity splenocyte assay and survival rates through a mouse model in particular igg igg1 igg2a and iga were markedly increased after immunization and the survival rates of t gondii were strongly inhibited by the immunized sera furthermore the immunization of sag1-vlps effectively decreased the production of specific cytokines such as il-1β il-6 tnf-α and ifn-γ after parasite infection in particular the immunized group showed strong activity and viability compared with the non-immunized infection group and their survival rate was 75%. these results demonstrate that sag1-vlp not only has the immunogenicity to block t gondii infection by effectively inducing the generation of specific antibodies against t gondii but is also an effective antigen delivery system for preventing toxoplasmosis this study indicates that sag1-vlp can be effectively utilized as a promising vaccine candidate for preventing or inhibiting t gondii infection
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a highly contagious virus infecting pigs of all ages with high morbidity and mortality among newborn piglets currently there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from pedv the n-terminal subunit of spike protein s1 is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes thus we expressed and produced recombinant s1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows methods affinity tagged pedv s1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system purified recombinant protein was analysed by sds-page western blot and deglycosylation assay a pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing pedv-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by elisa and virus neutralization assays piglets were challenged orally with pedv and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge results and conclusion of three eukaryotic expression systems tested yeast insect-cell and mammalian expression by hek-293 t cells gave the highest yield of protein that was n-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of s1-specific igg and iga that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets also high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets after pedv challenge piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow however there were no significant differences in diarrhea body weight and virus shedding thus vaccination with s1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure and further improvements are needed for the development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against pedv infection
we investigated in a unique setup of animal models and a human lung explant culture biological properties including zoonotic potential of a representative 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hpaiv h5n8 clade 2.3.4.4 group b h5n8b that spread rapidly in a huge and ongoing outbreak series in europe and caused high mortality in waterfowl and domestic birds hpaiv h5n8b showed increased virulence with rapid onset of severe disease and mortality in pekin ducks due to pronounced neuro-and hepatotropism cross-species infection was evaluated in mice ferrets and in a human lung explant culture model while the h5n8b isolate was highly virulent for balb/c mice virulence and transmissibility were grossly reduced in ferrets which was mirrored by marginal replication in human lung cultures infected ex vivo our data indicate that the 2016 hpaiv h5n8b is avian-adapted with augmented virulence for waterfowl but has low zoonotic potential the here tested combination of animal studies with the inoculation of human explants provides a promising future workflow to evaluate zoonotic potential mammalian replication competence and avian virulence of hpaiv
influenza virus infection of humans results in a respiratory disease that ranges in severity from sub-clinical infection to primary viral pneumonia that can result in death the clinical effects of infection vary with the exposure history age and immune status of the host and also the virulence of the influenza strain in humans the virus is transmitted through either aerosol or contact-based transfer of infectious respiratory secretions as is evidenced by most zoonotic influenza virus infections not all strains that can infect humans are able to transmit from person-to-person animal models of influenza are essential to research efforts aimed at understanding the viral and host factors that contribute to the disease and transmission outcomes of influenza virus infection in humans these models furthermore allow the pre-clinical testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in the population through amelioration of the virulence or transmissibility of influenza viruses mice ferrets guinea pigs cotton rats hamsters and macaques have all been used to study influenza viruses and therapeutics targeting them each model presents unique advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed herein
japanese encephalitis virusjev tick-borne encephalitis virustbev and eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev can cause symptoms of encephalitis establishment of accurate and easy methods by which to detect these viruses is essential for the prevention and treatment of associated infectious diseases currently there are still no multiple antigen detection methods available clinically an elisa-array which detects multiple antigens is easy to handle and inexpensive has enormous potential in pathogen detection an elisa-array method for the simultaneous detection of five encephalitis viruses was developed in this study seven monoclonal antibodies against five encephalitis-associated viruses were prepared and used for development of the elisa-array the elisa-array assay is based on a "sandwich" elisa format and consists of viral antibodies printed directly on 96-well microtiter plates allowing for direct detection of 5 viruses the developed elisa-array proved to have similar specificity and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional elisas this method was validated by different viral cultures and three chicken eggs inoculated with infected patient serum the results demonstrated that the developed elisa-array is sensitive and easy to use which would have potential for clinical use
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infection causes severe diarrhea in piglets and imposes a significant economic burden on pig farms single-chain fragment variable scfv antibodies effectively inhibit virus infection and could be a potential therapeutic reagent for preventing disease in this study a recombinant scfv antibody phage display library was constructed from peripheral blood lymphocytes of piglets infected with tgev the library was screened with four rounds of biopanning using purified tgev antigen and scfv antibodies that bound to tgev were obtained the scfv gene was subcloned into the pet-28a+ and the constituted plasmid was introduced into escherichia coli bl21 de3 for protein expression all three scfv clones identified had neutralizing activity against tgev an immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis demonstrated that two scfv antibodies reacted with the spike protein of tgev these results indicate that scfv antibodies provide protection against viral infection in vitro and may be a therapeutic candidate for both prevention and treatment of tgev infection in swine
vaccination is highly effective in preventing various infectious diseases whereas the constant threat of new emerging pathogens necessitates the development of innovative vaccination principles that also confer rapid protection in a case of emergency although increasing evidence points to t cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses here we analyze the immunological mechanisms of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox we found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on cd4 and cd8 t cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva or conventional vaccinia virus of note cd4 t cells were critically required to allow for mva induced cd8 t cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of mva induced protection in contrast selected components of the innate immune system and b cellmediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge in conclusion our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent cd8 t cell immunity plays a key role in mva conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox rapid induction of t cell immunity might serve as a new paradigm for treatments that need to fit into a scenario of protective emergency vaccination
pathogens that spill over between species cause a significant human and animal health burden here we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover we assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife and 84% included mammals further 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts rather than a single species for persistence among mammals the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents artiodactyls and carnivores the distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential we found birds primates and bats to be overrepresented we also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival thus we find that in many respects reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special the described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases
bacteroides fragilis is considered an important clinical pathogen and the most common anaerobe isolated from human and animal clinical specimens enterotoxigenic strains produce diarrhea the presence of enterotoxigenic etbf and nonenterotoxigenic b fragilis in stool samples from calves with or without acute diarrhea and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains were evaluated the stool samples were plated onto a selective b fragilis-bile-esculin agar and incubated anaerobically 10% co 2 /90% n 2 at 37 1c for 72 h species of the b fragilis group were identified by using the api 32-a kit enterotoxigenic strains were detected by pcr and the cytotoxic assay from 54 diarrhea and 54 nondiarrhea stools 124 and 92 members of the b fragilis group respectively were recovered only two etbf strains were isolated from two different diarrhea samples and the bft gene was detected in both moreover the bft gene was detected in dna from four different diarrheal stools samples but no etbf strain was recovered all the bacteria were susceptible to chloramphenicol imipenem moxifloxacin piperacillin/tazobactam metronidazole and tigecycline most of the isolates from both calves with and without diarrhea were resistant to all metals our results are of concern and suggest the need to increase the surveillance of antibiotic and metal resistance of this microbial group isolated from animal production such as calves
kawasaki disease causes systemic vasculitis the development of skin lesions at the vaccination site with bacillus calmette-guérin bcg is an important diagnostic symptom we hypothesized that infection with ubiquitous microorganisms immunogenically related to bcg might induce an immunopathologic reaction leading to the development of kawasaki disease mice were first inoculated with bcg and then secondarily inoculated 4 weeks later with crude extract from mycobacterium intracellulare cmi an abundant atypical mycobacterium animals inoculated with bcg followed by cmi developed coronary arteritis with infiltration of inflammatory cells whereas control animals inoculated with only cmi or bcg did not suggesting that the immune response to the mycobacteria induced autoimmunity to the vascular wall intravenous injection with antibodies to peroxiredoxin ii a modulator of vascular remodeling and a suggested target for autoimmune vasculitis also resulted in coronary arteritis but only after prior inoculation with bcg tumor necrosis factor-a mcp1 and interferon-g production were significantly higher in the animals inoculated with bcg than in the control groups p o 0.05 bcg immunization was required for the development of coronary arteritis suggesting that these cytokines might play important roles the results indicate that bcg induces primary autoimmunity and stimulates cytokine induction and that atypical mycobacterial infection boosts the autoimmunity resulting in coronary arteritis
although many studies provide strong evidence supporting the development of hcv virus-like particle vlp-based vaccines the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or multiple dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity in this study we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the tlr2 agonist pam 2 cys e 8 pam 2 cys to enhance the immunogenicity of vlps containing the hcv structural proteins core e1 and e2 of genotype 1a while co-formulation of this lipopeptide with vlps only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell dc uptake its ability to concomitantly induce dc maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using vlps alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant alum dramatically improved vlp and e2-specific antibody responses were observed in vlp+e 8 pam 2 cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted vlps was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of vlps formulated with this lipopeptide this result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of vlp+e 8 pam 2 cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of vlps by huh7 cells moreover vaccination of hla-a2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better vlp-specific ifn-c-mediated responses compared to nonadjuvanted vlps but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund's adjuvant these results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of hcv vlps can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to dcs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of hcv
cisplatin derivatives containing tilorone and a tilorone derivative were synthesized and characterized employing ir analysis mass spectrometry elemental analysis and chain length the polymeric cisplatin derivatives prevent growth of four transformed cell lines l929 143 vero and bs-c-1 and effectively inhibit four viruses including the dna viruses herpes simplex-1 vaccinia and varicella zoster and the rna virus reovirus in the micrograms/ml range the tilorone polymers display activity against both transformed cells and dna and rna viruses at biologically important concentrations
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases are major threats to global health economic stability and national security vaccines are key for reducing coronaviral disease burden however the utility of live-attenuated vaccines is limited by risks of reversion or repair because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness here we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks trns are effective vaccines against sars-cov the trn-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal sars-cov challenge while a 3-nt rewired trn reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage a 7-nt rewired trn is more stable suggesting that a more extensively rewired trn might be essential for avoiding growth selection in summary rewiring the trn is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the nidovirales order
sepsis is one of the oldest and most elusive syndromes in medicine with the confi rmation of germ theory by semmelweis pasteur and others sepsis was considered as a systemic infection by a pathogenic organism although the germ is probably the beginning of the syndrome and one of the major enemies to be identifi ed and fought sepsis is something wider and more elusive in this chapter clinically relevant themes of sepsis will be approached to provide an insight of everyday clinical practice for healthcare workers often not directly involved in the patient's management
background actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae app is one of the most important swine pathogens worldwide identification and characterization of novel antigenic app vaccine candidates are underway in the present study we use an immunoproteomic approach to identify app protein antigens that may elicit an immune response in serotype 1 naturally infected swine and serotype 1 virulent strain s259-immunized rabbits results proteins from total cell lysates of serotype 1 app were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis 2de western blot analysis revealed 21 immunoreactive protein spots separated in the ph 4-7 range and 4 spots in the ph 7-11 range with the convalescent sera from swine we found 5 immunoreactive protein spots that separated in the ph 4-7 range and 2 in the ph 7-11 range with hyperimmune sera from s259-immunized rabbits the proteins included the known antigens apxiia protective surface antigen d15 outer membrane proteins p5 subunit nqra the remaining antigens are being reported as immunoreactive proteins in app for the first time to our knowledge conclusions we identified a total of 42 immunoreactive proteins of the app serotype 1 virulent strain s259 which represented 32 different proteins including some novel immunoreactive factors which could be researched as vaccine candidates
hantaan virus htnv and puumala virus puuv are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome hfrs in europe and asia the development of well characterized animal models of htnv and puuv infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of hfrs vaccines and therapeutics in this study we present three animal models of htnv infection hamster ferret and marmoset and two animal models of puuv infection hamster ferret infection of hamsters with a~3 times the infectious dose 99% id 99 of htnv by the intramuscular and~1 id 99 of htnv by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung brain and kidney in contrast infection of hamsters with~2 id 99 of puuv by the intramuscular or~1 id 99 of puuv by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia and a transient detection of viral genome infection of ferrets with a high dose of either htnv or puuv by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected in marmosets a 1000 pfu htnv intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production similarly to the ferret model of htnv infection no renal impairment serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets this is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets
previous studies have reported that a prokaryotic-expressed recombinant nucleocapsid protein np is a suitable reagent for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus infection in this study soluble recombinant human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 np was produced to examine the antigenicity of the hcov-oc43 np of betacoronavirus using the purified recombinant np as an antigen a polyclonal antibody from rabbit serum with specificity for hcov-oc43 np was generated this antibody reacts specifically with hcov-oc43 np and does not cross-react with other human cov nps including those of sars-cov and hcov-229e by western blot sera from 26 young adults 17 middle-aged and elderly patients with respiratory infection and 15 cord blood samples were also tested strong reactivity to the nps of hcov-oc43 was observed in 96% 82% and 93% of the serum samples from the young adults respiratory patients and cord blood samples respectively to identify the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of the np that are recognised by the rabbit polyclonal antibody and human serum the antigenicities of three protein fragments including the n-terminal domain aa 1-173 the central-linker region aa 174-300 and the c-terminal domain aa 301-448 were evaluated by western blot the rabbit polyclonal antibody demonstrated greater immunoreactivity to the central-linker region and the c-terminal domain than to the n-terminal domain three different patterns for the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of hcov-oc43 np were observed in human serum suggesting variability in the immune responses that occur during hcov-oc43 infection in humans the central-linker region of the np appeared to be the most highly immunoreactive region for all three patterns observed the goal of this study was to offer insight into the design of diagnostic tools for hcov infection
the faecal microbiota plays a critical role in host health with alterations in the human faecal microbial composition associated with various conditions particularly diarrhoeal diseases however little is known about microbial changes during cryptosporidiosis one of the most important diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa in cattle in this study alterations in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves as a result of cryptosporidium parvum infection were investigated on a c parvum-positive farm comparisons were made among groups of c parvum-infected rotavirus-infected and the pathogen-negative calves a specific increase in the abundance of fusobacterium was observed in the faecal microbiota of c parvum-infected animals diarrhoea severity increased in accordance with the abundance of c parvum and fusobacterium moreover the specific increase of fusobacterium appeared to be a universal feature of c parvum infection since neonatal calves from geographically separated areas showed the same result these observations indicated that the growth of fusobacterium may be an important aggravating factor of cryptosporidiosis
background sporozoite immunization of animals and humans under a chemo-prophylactic cover of chloroquine cps-cq efficiently induces sterile protection against malaria in humans cps-cq is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites ras raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to cq chloroquine an established anti-malarial drug is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation the aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of cq during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in plasmodium berghei models methods a number of experiments in selected complimentary p berghei murine models in balb/cbyj and c57bl/6j mice was performed first the effect of cq administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by ras immunization was studied next the effect of cq on the induction of circumsporozoite cs protein-specific cd8 + t cells by immunization with p berghei parasites expressing a mutant cs protein was investigated finally a direct comparison of cps-cq to cps with mefloquine mq an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects was performed results when cq was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of ras this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory cd8 + t cells or cs protein-specific cd8 + t cells also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered replacement of cq by mq for cps immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of ifnγ producing memory t cells in the liver p = 0.01 but similar protection conclusions this study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of cq on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in p berghei malaria models alternatively the higher efficiency of cps compared to ras might be explained by an indirect effect of cq through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and therefore improved breadth of the immune response
the large virus family paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses such as measles- distemper- mumps- parainfluenza- newcastle disease- respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses here we identify an estimated 66 new paramyxoviruses in a worldwide sample of 119 bat and rodent species 9278 individuals major discoveries include evidence of an origin of hendra-and nipah virus in africa identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus mouse pneumonia-and canine distemper virus in bats as well as direct evidence of sendai virus in rodents phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major paramyxoviridae subfamilies paramyxovirinae and pneumovirinae future attempts to predict the emergence of novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on these data
mosquito-borne flaviviruses include several important agents of human disease and have provided striking examples of emerging infections in this study we present the design and validation of a single tube rt-pcr assay using a pair of consensus primers for the detection of mosquito-borne flaviviruses sequencing of the amplicons permits the species identification the assay was validated using rna from the yellow fever virus vaccine strain and from representative strains of dengue viruses 1 2 3 and 4 west nile virus kunjin virus a clade of west nile virus and st louis encephalitis virus
avian influenza is a significant economic burden on the poultry industry in geographical regions where it is enzootic it also poses a public health concern when avian influenza subtypes infect humans often with high mortality understanding viral genetic factors which positively contribute to influenza a virus iav fitnessinfectivity spread and pathogenesisis of great importance both for human and livestock health pb1-f2 is a small accessory protein encoded by iav and in mammalian hosts has been implicated in a wide range of functions that contribute to increased pathogenesis in the avian host the protein has been understudied despite high-level full-length conservation in avian iav isolates which is in contrast to the truncations of the pb1-f2 length frequently found in mammalian host isolates here we report that the presence of a full-length pb1-f2 protein from a low pathogenicity h9n2 avian influenza virus prolongs infectious virus shedding from directly inoculated chickens thereby enhancing transmission of the virus by lengthening the transmission window to contact birds as well as extending transmission the presence of a full-length pb1-f2 suppresses pathogenicity evidenced by an increased minimum lethal dose in embryonated chicken eggs and increasing survival in directly infected birds when compared to a virus lacking an orf for pb1-f2 we propose that there is a positive pressure to maintain a full-length functional pb1-f2 protein upon infection of avian hosts as it contributes to the effective transmission of iav in the field five supplementary tables and one supplementary figure are available in the online supplementary material
callebaut p debouck p and pensaert m 1982 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the coronavirus-[ike agent and its antibodies in pigs with porcine epidemic diarrhea vet microbiol 7 295--306 an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa was developed for the detection of the coronavirus-like agent in feces of pigs naturally affected with porcine epidemic diarrhea ped or experimentally infected with the cv777 isolate the assay was specific and more sensitive than electron microscopy an elisa blocking assay is described for the detection and titration of antibodies specific antibody formation was demonstrated in pigs experimentally infected with cv777 and in swine naturally affected with ped.0378-1135/82/0000--0000/$02.75
development of antivirals has focused primarily on vaccines and on treatments for specific viral agents although effective these approaches may be limited in situations where the etiologic agent is unknown or when the target virus has undergone mutation recombination or reassortment augmentation of the innate immune response may be an effective alternative for disease amelioration nonspecific broad-spectrum immune responses can be induced by double-stranded dsrnas such as poly iclc or oligonucleotides odns containing unmethylated deocycytidyl-deoxyguanosinyl cpg motifs these may offer protection against various bacterial and viral pathogens regardless of their genetic makeup zoonotic origin or drug resistance
since there is no available serological methods to detect antibodies to ferret coronavirus frcov an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa using recombinant partial nucleocapsid n proteins of the ferret coronavirus frcov yamaguchi-1 strain was developed to establish a serological method for detection of frcov infection many serum samples collected from ferrets recognized both a a 1-179 and a a 180-374 of the n protein but two serum samples did not a a 180-374 of the n protein this different reactivity was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the serum from the ferret therefore the a a 1-179 of the n protein was used as an elisa antigen serological test was carried out using sera or plasma of ferrets in japan surprisingly 89% ferrets in japan had been infected with frcov these results indicated that our established elisa using a a 1-179 of the n protein is useful for detection of antibody to frcov for diagnosis and seroepidemiology of frcov infection key words enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa ferret coronavirus frcov nucleocapsid n
influenza vaccines that can be administered intranasally or by other needle-free delivery routes have potential advantages over injected formulations in terms of patient compliance cost and ease of global distribution supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation however at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses when delivered intranasally and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase pa and the q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites the cd8 + t cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce ifn-γ ex vivo lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo and diminish viral loads in infected mice compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory cd8 + t cells in the lung allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination these results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering cd8 + epitopes without adjuvant or cd4 + epitopes are non-inflammatory and promote more lung-resident memory cd8 + t cells compared to subcutaneous immunization
the nairoviruses are a rapidly emerging group of tick-borne bunyaviruses that includes pathogens of humans crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus and livestock nairobi sheep disease virus also known as ganjam virus as well as a large number of viruses for which the normal vertebrate host has not been established studies on this group of viruses have been fairly limited not least because cchfv is a bsl4 human pathogen restricting the number of labs able to study the live virus while nsdv although highly pathogenic in naive animals is not seen as a threat in developed countries making it a low priority nevertheless recent years have seen significant progress in our understanding of the biology of these viruses particularly that of cchfv and this article seeks to draw together our existing knowledge to generate an overall picture of their molecular biology underlining areas of particular ignorance for future studies
the domestic pig is an important agricultural animal and thus infectious diseases that affect pigs can cause severe economic losses in the global swine industry various porcine pathogens target macrophages which are classical innate immune cells although macrophages basically protect the host from pathogens they also seem to contribute to infectious processes therefore cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens however the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited in this study we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage ipkm cell line which was generated by transferring the sv40 large t antigen sv40lt and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase ptert genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors the ipkm displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged doubling time about 4 days these cells were immunostained for macrophage markers in addition they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide lps stimulation furthermore the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in lps-primed ipkm these findings suggest that ipkm exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages by transferring the sv40lt and ptert genes using lentiviral vectors we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig these results suggest that the co-expression of sv40lt and ptert is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages
human infections by the newly reassorted avian influenza a h7n9 virus were reported for the first time in early 2013 and the virus was confirmed to be a low pathogenic avian influenza virus in poultry because continuously reported cases have been increasing since the summer of 2013 this novel virus poses a potential threat to public health in china and is attracting broad attention worldwide in this review we summarize and discuss the characteristics of the h7n9 virus revealed by the recent timely studies from the perspectives of epidemiology host preference clinical manifestations immunopathogenesis drug resistance vaccine development and burden of disease this knowledge about the novel avianorigin h7n9 virus will provide a useful reference for clinical interventions of human infections and help to rapidly pave the way to develop an efficient and safe vaccine
bats are a unique group of mammals of the order chiroptera they are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission this article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses covs before the sars epidemic bats were not known to be hosts for covs in the last 15 years bats have been found to be hosts of >30 covs with complete genomes sequenced and many more if those without genome sequences are included among the four cov genera only alphacovs and betacovs have been found in bats as a whole both alphacovs and betacovs have been detected from bats in asia europe africa north and south america and australasia but alphacovs seem to be more widespread than betacovs and their detection rate is also higher for betacovs only those from subgenera sarbecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus and hibecovirus have been detected in bats most notably horseshoe bats are the reservoir of sars-cov and several betacovs from subgenus merbecovirus are closely related to mers-cov in addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves bat-animal and bat-human interactions such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in southern china are important for interspecies transmission of covs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks
development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov is crucial in the prevention of sars reemergence the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike s protein is an important target in developing safe and effective sars vaccines our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adenoassociated virus encoding rbd rbd-raav induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies in this study we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with rbd-raav prime/rbd-specific t cell peptide boost compared with the rbd-raav prime/boost vaccination rbd-raav prime/rbd-peptide rbd-pep boost induced similar levels of th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge but stronger th2 and ctl responses no significant immune responses and protective effects were detected in mice vaccinated with rbd-pep or blank aav alone since t cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory t cells which may be effective against viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective broad and long-term protection against sars-cov infection
throughout the world populations of scavenger birds are declining rapidly with some populations already on the brink of extinction much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues lead and other toxins despite increased monitoring of these declining populations little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species to assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in california the california condor gymnogyps californianus turkey vulture cathartes aura and golden eagle aquila chrysaetos california condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus infectious bronchitis virus mycoplasma gallisepticum avian paramyxovirus-2 west nile virus wnv and toxoplasma gondii golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus chlamydophila psittaci and toxoplasma gondii and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus chlamydophila psittaci avian paramyxovirus-1 toxoplasma gondii and wnv risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to wnv among free-flying condors this study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered california condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats aic 101.2 € wild = hatched and raised in the wild laz = raised at the los angeles zoo sdzsp = raised at san diego zoo safari park out = raised outside of california se = standard error ci = confidence interval ref = reference category
the zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses is particularly demonstrated by their broad host range like the highly pathogenic hendra and nipah viruses originating from bats but while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across africa australia south america and asia we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging european bats moreover we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in germany and tested for paramyxovirus rna in parallel to a histo-pathological examination nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus rubulavirus two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with hendra virus our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus-host co-evolution in european bats since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera rubulavirus and jeilongvirus a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other microchiroptera compared to megachiroptera can be assumed given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in europe needs to be considered
aging-related decline in immunity is believed to be the main driver behind decreased vaccine efficacy and reduced resistance to infections in older adults unrepaired dna damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age-related phenotypes consistent with this some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole-body irradiation wbi which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells to decisively test whether and to what extent wbi in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages we exposed young male c57bl/6 mice to sublethal wbi 0.5-4 gy mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe we followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan response to vaccination and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age none of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock-irradiated 0 gy animals for the parameters measured even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal wbi in youth 4 gy exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis robust t-and b-cell responses to live attenuated west nile virus wnv vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal wnv challenge therefore a single dose of nonlethal wbi in youth resulting in widespread dna damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model
we summarize findings of sars-cov infections in several animal models each of which support viral replication in lungs accompanied by histopathological changes and/or clinical signs of illness to varying degrees new findings are reported on sars-cov replication and associated pathology in two additional strains c57bl/6 and 129s6 of aged mice we also provide new comparative data on viral replication and associated pathology following infection of golden syrian hamsters with various sars-cov strains and report the levels of neutralizing antibody titers following these infections and the cross-protective efficacy of infection with these strains in protecting against heterologous challenge finally we summarize findings of a variety of vaccine approaches and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the potential for disease enhancement following re-infection in animals previously vaccinated against or infected with sars-cov
there have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis ms and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades however in every case further research has disproved the original claim thus we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid csf of three patients with ms and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the patients yielding the isolates from their csf possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system cns diseases studied at the same time the virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the cns the agent has not yet been adequately address reprint requests to dr
this study compares some etiological factors involved in the naturally occurrence of lamb scours in 18 merino sheep farms randomly selected in the area of "la serena" southwest spain a lack of influence of some variables flock size type of facilities type of breeding lambing percentage isolation of campylobacter jejuni rotavirus spp coronavirus spp and salmonella spp on lamb mortality rate was detected the opposite was true for cleaning of the lambing areas organization of lambing periods accumulation of lambs in the pens high content of fat protein and lactose in milk and low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes cryptosporidium spp and escherichia coli isolation showed a trend to be linked to the presence of diarrhoea a positive correlation was found between serum total protein in ewes and serum gamma globulin in lambs thus the measure of serum total protein in ewes before lambing would be a valuable indicator of the risk of lamb scouring and it would be useful to establish an adequate programme to prevent this condition in the farms of this geographical area
background porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes diarrhea in all ages of pigs with 50-100% mortality rates in neonatal piglets in the united states inactivated and subunit pedv vaccines for pregnant sows are available but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from pedv naïve sows a safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed in this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated pedv vaccine candidates the emerging non-s indel pedv strain pc22a at the 100th cell culture passage level -clone no 4 p100c4 and at the 120th passage level p120 in weaned pigs results four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with pedv pc22a-p3 virulent -p100c4 -p120 and mock respectively and challenged with the p3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation dpi after inoculation p3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral rna shedding p100c4 and p120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs although viral rna was detected in feces of all pigs except for one p100c4-inoculated pig compared with the p120 group p3-and p100c4-inoculated pigs had higher serum pedv-specific igg and viral neutralizing vn antibody ab titers at 14 dpi after the challenge no pigs in the p3 group but all pigs in the p100c4 p120 and mock groups had diarrhea compared with the p120 group pigs in the p100c4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal pedv rna shedding titers higher titers of serum pedv-specific igg iga and vn abs and higher numbers of intestinal iga ab-secreting cells conclusions pedv pc22a p100c4 and p120 were fully attenuated in weaned pigs but failed to elicit protection against virulent p3 challenge p100c4 induced higher pedv-specific antibody responses than p120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge therefore p100c4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics it also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a pedv vaccination regimen whose efficacy can be tested in the future
bats are crucial for proper functioning of an ecosystem they provide various important services to ecosystem and environment while bats are well-known carrier of pathogenic viruses their possible role as a potential carrier of pathogenic bacteria is under-explored here using culture-based approach employing multiple bacteriological media over thousand bacteria were cultivated and identified from rousettus leschenaultii a frugivorous bat species the majority of which were from the family enterobacteriaceae and putative pathogens next pathogenic potential of most frequently cultivated component of microbiome i e escherichia coli was assessed to identify its known pathotypes which revealed the presence of virulent factors in many cultivated e coli isolates applying in-depth bacterial community analysis using high-throughput 16 s rrna gene sequencing a high inter-individual variation was observed among the studied guano samples interestingly a higher diversity of bacterial communities was observed in decaying guano representative the search against human pathogenic bacteria database at 97% identity a small proportion of sequences were found associated to wellknown human pathogens the present study thus indicates that this bat species may carry potential bacterial pathogens and advice to study the effect of these pathogens on bats itself and the probable mode of transmission to humans and other animals
most coronaviruses infecting humans cause mild diseases whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-associated coronavirus is an extremely dangerous pathogen here we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses hcovs based on recombinant nucleocapsid n proteins of all known pathogenic strains 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 sars the novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different hcovs in a single experiment for assay evaluation serum samples from persons infected with 229e or oc43 acute/convalescent recovered sars patients and healthy donors were analyzed screening for nucleocapsid n-specific immunoglobulin g igg in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity with this new technique we found that recently identified nl63 and hku1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections possibly cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229e and oc43 serum pairs however the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing sars-positive serum samples where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other hcovs was not observed this coronavirus strain-specific line immunoassay represents a powerful tool for serologic diagnostics
background pre-existing immunity to vaccinia tian tan virus vtt resulting from a large vaccination campaign against smallpox prior to the early 1980s in china has been a major issue for application of vtt-vector based vaccines it is essential to establish a sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay to understand the epidemiology of vaccinia-specific immunity in current populations in china a new anti-vaccinia virus vacv neutralization assay that used the attenuated replication-competent vtt carrying the firefly luciferase gene of photinus pyralis rtv-fluc was established and standardized for critical parameters that included the choice of cell line viral infection dose and the infection time the current study evaluated the maintenance of virus-specific immunity after smallpox vaccination by conducting a non-randomized crosssectional analysis of antiviral antibody-mediated immune responses in volunteers examined 30-55 years after vaccination the rtv-fluc neutralization assay was able to detect neutralizing antibodies nabs against vaccinia virus without the ability to differentiate strains of vaccinia virus we showed that the neutralizing titers measured by our assay were similar to those obtained by the traditional plaque reduction neutralization test prnt using this assay we found a low prevalence of nab to vtt 7.6% in individuals born before 1980 from beijing and anhui provinces in china and when present anti-vtt nab titers were low no nabs were detected in all 222 samples from individuals born after 1980 there was no significant difference observed for titer or prevalence by gender age range and geographic origin conclusion a simplified sensitive standardized reproducible and high-throughput assay was developed for the quantitation of nabs against different vaccinia strains the current study provides useful insights for the future development of vtt-based vaccination in beijing and anhui provinces of china
hepatitis c virus hcv infects 2% of the world's population and is the leading cause of liver disease and liver transplantation it poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies however these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations the introduction of a hcv vaccine has been predicted using simulation models in a high risk population to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of hcv a vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce hcv incidence in this population virus like particles vlps are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses thus vlps represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses currently many vlp-based vaccines have entered clinical trials while licensed vlp vaccines for hepatitis b virus hbv and human papilloma virus hpv have been in use for many years the hcv core e1 and e2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic vlps while inclusion of hcv antigens into heterogenous chimeric vlps is also a promising approach these vlps are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial yeast mammalian plant or insect cells here this paper will review hcv vlp-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production
bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity although several of these viruses are zoonotic the majority are not astroviruses transmitted fecal-orally are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans these features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history epidemiology in the host and temporal shedding trends our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in singapore reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection of the seven species screened astroviruses were detected in rhinolophus lepidus and eonycteris spelaea the r lepidus sequences grouped with other rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from china and laos while the eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from rousettus spp in laos and pteropus giganteus in bangladesh but not with other e spelaea sequences longitudinal collections of eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses this study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats it also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness host ecology such as roosting behavior may drive co-infections virus maintenance and spillover
viral pathogens have evolved a wide range of tactics to evade host immune responses and thus propagate effectively one efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope therefore it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal in this study we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 using this antibody we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope the vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization this antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch
background severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by infection with sars-associated coronavirus cov amino acid residues 450-650 of the spike s glycoprotein of sars-cov s450-650 contains dominant epitopes for anti-viral antibodies abs in patient sera objectives to develop and evaluate an elisa system for detection of anti-s abs in patient sera study design express recombinant s450-650 in e coli and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an elisa system based on the s450-650 polypeptide results the s450-650-based elisa detected igg abs in 41 out of 51 serum samples from 22 hospitalized patients with probable sars a result closely correlated with that obtained with a virus-based elisa r = 0.75 k = 0.8 differential anti-s igg responses were observed amongst sars patients some of them produced anti-s abs early during their infection while others failed to make igg abs against the s450-650 polypeptide none of the serum samples from 100 healthy blood donors was positive in the s450-650-based assay conclusion the s450-650-based elisa can detect anti-s igg abs with high sensitivity and specificity
the bacterium clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism-a severe intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxin bont and characterized by damage to the nervous system in an effort to develop novel c botulinum immunotherapeutics camelid single-domain antibodies sdabs vhhs or nanobodies could be used due to their unique structure and characteristics in this study vhhs were produced using phage display technology a total of 15 different monoclonal vhhs were selected based on their comlementarity-determining region 3 cdr3 sequences different toxin lethal dose ld 50 challenges with each selected phage clone were conducted in vivo to check their neutralizing potency we demonstrated that modification of neutralizing vhhs with a human immunoglobulin g igg1 fc fragment crystallizable fragment fusionbody vhh-fc significantly increased the circulation time in the blood up to 14 days at the same time vhh-fc showed the protective activity 1000 times higher than monomeric form when challenged with 5 ld 50 . moreover vhh-fcs remained protective even 14 days after antibody administration these results indicate that this vhh-fc could be used as an effective long term antitoxin protection against botulinum type a key contribution fusion of anti-botulinum vhhs to fc fragments significantly increases the protective activity in vivo and serum antibody circulation time
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a public health concern worldwide by studying the human leukocyte antigen hla types a b dr and dq alleles in 90 chinese patients with serologically confirmed sars infections we identified a strong association between hla-b*0703 or 4.08 95% ci 2.03-8.18 and -drb1*0301 or 0.06 95% 0.01-0.47 p p .00008 p .0042 and the development of sars moreover the frequency of b*0703 and b60 coinheritance 9.6% 95% ci 4.6%-19.0% in our sars group was significantly higher ϫ9 p p 3 ϫ 10 than that expected in the general population 0.4%. these genetic data will critically affect both the study of the pathogenesis of sars and the design of vaccination programs
wastewater treatment center wtc workers may be vulnerable to diseases caused by viruses such as the common cold influenza and gastro-intestinal infections although there is a substantial body of literature characterizing the microbial community found in wastewater only a few studies have characterized the viral component of wtc aerosols despite the fact that most diseases affecting wtc workers are of viral origin and that some of these viruses are transmitted through the air in this study we evaluated in four wtcs the presence of 11 viral pathogens of particular concern in this milieu and used a metagenomic approach to characterize the total viral community in the air of one of those wtcs the presence of viruses in aerosols in different locations of individual wtcs was evaluated and the results obtained with four commonly used air samplers were compared we detected four of the eleven viruses tested including human adenovirus hadv rotavirus hepatitis a virus hav and herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv1 the results of the metagenomic assay uncovered very few viral rna sequences in wtc aerosols however sequences from human dna viruses were in much greater relative abundance
infectious bronchitis virus ibv represents a major threat to poultry production worldwide particularly when complicated with bacterial infection in the present study samples were collected from forty broiler farms with respiratory manifestations to characterize ibv and e coli bacteriophages were isolated and enriched from sampled farms to study its efficacy to control single and mixed infections with e coli and ibv in vivo twelve out of forty farms were positive for ibv phylogenetic analysis of partial spike protein revealed that all positive cases clustered within the gi-23 genotype eight out of forty farms were positive for e coli serogroups o26 o78 o86 o114 o119 with o125 found on three farms bacteriophage treatment delayed the onset and reduced the severity of clinical signs and prevented the mortality associated with single and mixed infection with ibv and e coli furthermore in mixed infections bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced e coli as well as ibv shedding groups treated with bacteriophages showed a significant reduction of e coli shedding that gradually decreased over time in contrast to higher and gradually increasing shedding without bacteriophage treatment in conclusion bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced the pathogenicity and shedding of ibvand e coli in mixed infections article history
vaccination programs against infectious bronchitis virus ibv in egypt depend on both classical and/or imported variant ibv strain vaccines however many ibv outbreaks associated with respiratory distress nephropathy and high mortalities were attributed to the circulation of both classical and new nephropathogenic ibv variant 2 strains in the present study we report the development of attenuated ibv candidate vaccines using the classic ibv strains ibm41 and ib2 and a nephropathogenic strain ibvar2 the wild-type wt viruses were attenuated through serial passages in embryonated specific pathogen free spf chicken eggs virulence of the attenuated viruses was then tested via the ocular route inoculation and the in vivo back passage in day-old spf chickens efficacy against homologous challenge was investigated also in day-old spf chickens results showed that the viruses were successfully adapted to the embryo by the 100th ibm41 and ib2 and 110th passages ibvar2 the attenuated viruses were safe and showed no change of virulence in day-old spf chickens up to the 10th back passages the efficacy experiment showed that the attenuated vaccines showed 90 to 100% protection against the homologous challenge based on ciliostasis score and protection percent the att-ibm41 and att-ib2 vaccines were able to reduce the shedding of the challenge at 3 days post-infection dpi and no virus shedding was detected in both vaccinated groups by 5 dpi in the att-ibvar2 vaccinated birds only 20% of vaccinated birds shed the challenge virus with low titers 10 2.10±0.3 eid 50 /ml at 3 dpi in conclusion the attenuated strains ibm41 ib2 and ibvar2 are efficient vaccine candidates against currently circulating classic and variant ib viruses respectively further studies to evaluate the field efficacy and combining these attenuated ibv strains to induce a wider protection against heterologous ibv challenge are suggested
one sentence summary prime-only vaccination with chadox1 mers provides protective immunity against hcov-emc/2012 replication in rhesus macaques and a wide variety of mers-cov strains in mice middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov continues to infect humans via the dromedary camel reservoir and can transmit between humans most commonly via nosocomial transmission currently no licensed vaccine is available previously we showed that vaccination of transgenic mice with chadox1 mers encoding the mers s protein prevented disease upon lethal challenge in the current study we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly after a single intramuscular vaccination with chadox1 mers upon mers-cov challenge vaccinated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction in viral load in lung tissue of several logs furthermore we did not detect mers-cov replication in type i and ii pneumocytes of chadox1 mers vaccinated animals a prime-boost regimen of chadox1 mers boosted antibody titers and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques finally we investigated the ability of chadox1 mers to protect against six different mers-cov strains isolated between 2012 to 2018 from dromedary camels and humans in the middle east and africa antibodies elicited by chadox1 mers in rhesus macaques were able to neutralize all mers-cov strains vaccination of transgenic hdpp4 mice with chadox1 mers completely protected the animals against disease and lethality for all different mers-cov strains the data support further clinical development of chadox1 mers supported by cepi
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreaks in the arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region raising the concern that a global pandemic could occur here we show that a dna vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids s1 of mers-cov spike s protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice with three immunizations high titers of neutralizing antibodies up to 1 10 4 were generated without adjuvant dna vaccination with the mers-cov s1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigenspecific cd4 + and cd8 + t cells secreting ifn-c and other cytokines both pcdna3.1-s1 dna vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcdna3.1-s1 vaccinated mice protected ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice from mers-cov challenge these results demonstrate that a dna vaccine encoding mers-cov s1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against mers-cov infection
vaccination is historically one of the most successful strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases for safety reasons modern vaccinology tends toward the usage of inactivated or attenuated microorganisms and uses predominantly subunit vaccines the antigens need to be clearly defined pure stable appropriately composed and properly presented to the immune system of the host differing ratios of various proportions between specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses are essential for conferring the required protection in the case of individual vaccines to stimulate both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells the antigens must be processed and presented to both antigen-presentation pathways mhc i and mhc ii protein antigens delivered by vaccination are processed as extracellular antigens however extracellularly delivered antigen can be directed towards intracellular presentation pathways in conjugation with molecules involved in antigen cross-presentation e g heat shock proteins or by genomic-dna vaccination in this overview current knowledge of the host immune response to dna vaccines is summarized in the introduction the subsequent sections discuss techniques for enhancing dna vaccine efficacy such as dna delivery to specific tissues delivery of dna to the cell cytoplasm or nucleus and enhancement of the immune response using molecular adjuvants finally the prospects of dna vaccination and ongoing clinical trials with various dna vaccines are discussed
severe acute respiratory syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002-2003 epidemic many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in balb/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus ma15 which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality here we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells rdc to the draining lymph nodes dln with a consequent deficient virus-specific t cell response all of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate which deplete alveolar macrophages am inhibitory ams are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and t cells the inhibitory effects of am can also be nullified if mice or ams are pretreated with poly ic which directly activate ams and rdcs through toll-like receptors 3 tlr3 further adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdc protect mice from lethal ma15 infection these results may be relevant for sars in humans which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a sars-covspecific immune response in individuals with severe disease
has the most extensive geographic distribution of the medically important tickborne viral diseases closely approximating the known global distribution of hyalomma spp ticks human beings become infected through tick bites by crushing infected ticks after contact with a patient with cchf during the acute phase of infection or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock clinical features commonly show a dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage myalgia and fever the levels of liver enzymes creatinine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase are raised and bleeding markers are prolonged infection of the endothelium has a major pathogenic role besides direct infection of the endothelium indirect damage by viral factors or virus-mediated host-derived soluble factors that cause endothelial activations and dysfunction are thought to occur in diagnosis enzyme-linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr are used early diagnosis is critical for patient therapy and prevention of potential nosocomial infections supportive therapy is the most essential part of case management recent studies suggest that ribavirin is eff ective against cchf although defi nitive studies are not available healthcare workers have a serious risk of infection particularly during care of patients with haemorrhages from the nose mouth gums vagina and injection sites simple barrier precautions have been reported to be eff ective
in this study swine fecal specimens n = 251 collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by rt-pcr porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % 33/251 of the samples we demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in kenya and uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs nursing piglets 15 % post-weaning 3month-old pigs 17 % 4-month-old pigs 10 %. genetic analysis of the partial rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp region 690 nt revealed that kobuviruses circulating in east africa are diverse sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses respectively the nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 % 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 % respectively additionally upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp rt-pcr bands while using the same primer set we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses to our knowledge this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an african region further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies
background the nasopharyngeal np microbiota plays an important role in bovine health comprising a rich and diverse microbial community the nasopharynx is also the niche for potentially pathogenic agents which are associated with bovine respiratory disease brd a serious and costly illness in feedlot cattle we used 14 beef heifers from a closed and disease-free herd to assess the dynamics of the np microbiota of cattle that are transported to a feedlot cattle were sampled prior to transport to the feedlot day 0 and at days 2 7 and 14 results the structure of the np microbiota changed significantly over the course of the study with the largest shift occurring between day 0 prior to transport and day 2 p < 0.001 phylogenetic diversity and richness increased following feedlot placement day 2 p < 0.05 the genera pasteurella bacillus and proteus were enriched at day 0 streptococcus and acinetobacter at day 2 bifidobacterium at day 7 and mycoplasma at day 14 the functional potential of the np microbiota was assessed using picrust revealing that replication and repair as well as translation pathways were more relatively abundant in day 14 samples these differences were driven mostly by mycoplasma although eight cattle were culture-positive for the brd-associated bacterium pasteurella multocida at one or more sampling times none were culture-positive for mannheimia haemolytica or histophilus somni conclusions this study investigated the effect that feedlot placement has on the np microbiota of beef cattle over a 14-d period within two days of transport to the feedlot the np microbiota changed significantly increasing in both phylogenetic diversity and richness these results demonstrate that there is an abrupt shift in the np microbiota of cattle after transportation to a feedlot this may have importance for understanding why cattle are most susceptible to brd after feedlot placement
pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics live sars-cov-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on a vsv pseudovirus production system a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities the key parameters for this assay were optimized including cell types cell numbers virus inoculum when tested against the sars-cov-2 pseudovirus sars-cov-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency which underscore its potential as therapeutics the limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples the cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples respectively this assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra-and inter-assay analyses respectively taken together we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for sars-cov-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus
background diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are rna viruses next generation sequencing ngs deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level the diversity of rna viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by ngs samples were selected among the cases submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratories of infectious diseases of the universitat autònoma de barcelona barcelona spain and universidad de león león spain results the analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of rna viruses most samples were co-infected by several viruses kobuvirus and rotavirus were more commonly reported with sapovirus astrovirus 3 4 and 5 enterovirus g porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pasivirus and posavirus being less frequently detected most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in genbank allowing us to propose several new vp4 and vp7 genotypes for rotavirus b and rotavirus c conclusions among the cases analysed rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs besides in a small number of cases kobuvirus and sapovirus may also have an aetiological role even most animals were co-infected in early life the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear the ngs method applied successfully characterized the rna virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity

introduction adjuvants form an integral component in most of the inactivated and subunit vaccine formulations careful and proper selection of adjuvants helps in promoting appropriate immune responses against target pathogens at both innate and adaptive levels such that protective immunity can be elicited areas covered herein we describe the recent progress in our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants that are licensed for use in human vaccines or in clinical or pre-clinical stages at both innate and adaptive levels different pathogens have distinct characteristics which require the host to mount an appropriate immune response against them adjuvants can be selected to elicit a tailor-made immune response to specific pathogens based on their unique properties identification of biomarkers of adjuvanticity for several candidate vaccines using omics-based technologies can unravel the mechanism of action of modern and experimental adjuvants expert opinion adjuvant technology has been revolutionized over the last two decades in-depth understanding of the role of adjuvants in activating the innate immune system combined with systems vaccinology approaches have led to the development of next-generation novel adjuvants that can be used in vaccines against challenging pathogens and in specific target populations article history
an unexplained outbreak of feline diarrhea and vomiting negative for common 25 enteric viral and bacterial pathogens was subjected to viral metagenomics and pcr we 26 characterized from fecal samples the genome of a novel chapparvovirus we named fechavirus 27 that was shed by 8/17 affected cats and different feline bocaviruses shed by 9/17 cats also 28 detected were nucleic acids from attenuated vaccine viruses members of the normal feline 29 virome viruses found in only one or two cases and viruses likely derived from ingested food 30 products epidemiological investigation of disease signs time of onset and transfers of affected 31 cats between three facilities support a possible role for this new chapparvovirus in a highly 32 contagious feline diarrhea and vomiting disease 33 34 35
the effect of newly emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin in human populations can be potentially catastrophic and large-scale investigations of such diseases are highly challenging the monitoring of emergence events is subject to ascertainment bias whether at the level of species discovery emerging disease events or disease outbreaks in human populations disease surveillance is generally performed post hoc driven by a response to recent events and by the availability of detection and identification technologies additionally the inventory of pathogens that exist in mammalian and other reservoirs is incomplete and identifying those with the potential to cause disease in humans is rarely possible in advance a major step in understanding the burden and diversity of zoonotic infections the local behavioral and demographic risks of infection and the risk of emergence of these pathogens in human populations is to establish surveillance networks in populations that maintain regular contact with diverse animal populations maia a rabaa ngo tri tue and tran my phuc contributed equally to this work.ó 2015 the author s and to simultaneously characterize pathogen diversity in human and animal populations vietnam has been an epicenter of disease emergence over the last decade and practices at the human/animal interface may facilitate the likelihood of spillover of zoonotic pathogens into humans to tackle the scientific issues surrounding the origins and emergence of zoonotic infections in vietnam we have established the vietnam initiative on zoonotic infections vizions this countrywide project in which several international institutions collaborate with vietnamese organizations is combining clinical data epidemiology high-throughput sequencing and social sciences to address relevant one-health questions here we describe the primary aims of the project the infrastructure established to address our scientific questions and the current status of the project our principal objective is to develop an integrated approach to the surveillance of pathogens circulating in both human and animal populations and assess how frequently they are exchanged this infrastructure will facilitate systematic investigations of pathogen ecology and evolution enhance understanding of viral cross-species transmission events and identify relevant risk factors and drivers of zoonotic disease emergence
nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev are closely related recently emerged paramyxoviruses that are capable of causing considerable morbidity and mortality in several mammalian species including humans henipavirus-specific vaccines are still commercially unavailable and development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent lethal infections due to henipaviruses is highly desirable here we describe the development of adeno-associated virus aav vaccines expressing the niv g protein characterization of these vaccines in mice demonstrated that a single intramuscular aav injection was sufficient to induce a potent and longlasting antibody response translational studies in hamsters further demonstrated that all vaccinated animals were protected against lethal challenge with niv in addition this vaccine induced a cross-protective immune response that was able to protect 50% of the animals against a challenge by hev this study presents a new efficient vaccination strategy against henipaviruses and opens novel perspectives on the use of aav vectors as vaccines against emergent diseases
around 10000 people die each year due to severe dengue disease and two-thirds of the world population lives in a region where dengue disease is endemic there has been remarkable progress in dengue virus vaccine development however there are no licensed antivirals for dengue disease and none appear to be in clinical trials we took the approach of repositioning approved drugs for anti-dengue virus activity by screening a library of pharmacologically active compounds we identified n-desmethylclozapine fluoxetine hydrochloride and salmeterol xinafoate as dengue virus inhibitors based on reductions in the numbers of infected cells and viral titers dengue virus rna levels were diminished in inhibitor-treated cells and this effect was specific to dengue virus as other flaviviruses such as japanese encephalitis virus and west nile virus or other rna viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus were not affected by these inhibitors all three inhibitors specifically inhibited dengue virus replication with 50% inhibitory concentrations ic 50 s in the high-nanomolar range estimation of negative-strand rna intermediates and time-of-addition experiments indicated that inhibition was occurring at a postentry stage most probably at the initiation of viral rna replication finally we show that inhibition is most likely due to the modulation of the endolysosomal pathway and induction of autophagy
diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of deaths in children a limited number of studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens in cameroon and as in many other african countries the cause of many diarrheal episodes remains unexplained a proportion of these unknown cases of diarrhea are likely caused by yet-unidentified viral agents some of which could be the result of recent interspecies transmission from animal reservoirs like bats using viral metagenomics we screened fecal samples of 221 humans almost all with gastroenteritis symptoms between 0 and 89 years of age with different degrees of bat contact we identified viruses belonging to families that are known to cause gastroenteritis such as adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae interestingly a mammalian orthoreovirus picobirnaviruses a smacovirus and a pecovirus were also found although there was no evidence of interspecies transmission of the most common human gastroenteritis-related viruses astroviridae caliciviridae and reoviridae the phylogenies of the identified orthoreovirus picobirnavirus and smacovirus indicate a genetic relatedness of these viruses identified in stools of humans and those of bats and/or other animals these findings points out the possibility of interspecies transmission or simply a shared host of these viruses bacterial fungal parasitic . . . present in both animals bats and humans further screening of bat viruses in humans or vice versa will elucidate the epidemiological potential threats of animal viruses to human health furthermore this study showed a huge diversity of highly divergent novel phages thereby expanding the existing phageome considerably
many rna viruses arise from animal reservoirs namely bats rodents and insectivores but mechanisms of virus maintenance and transmission still need to be addressed the bicolored white-toothed shrew crocidura leucodon has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic borna disease virus 1 bodv-1 six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with bodv-1 all shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews interestingly all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction infectious virus and viral rna were demonstrated in saliva urine skin swabs lacrimal fluid and faeces both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity the various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep naturally bodv-1infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems
infectious bronchitis ib and newcastle disease nd are common viral diseases of chickens which are caused by infectious bronchitis virus ibv and newcastle disease virus ndv respectively vaccination with live attenuated strains of ibv-h120 and ndv-lasota are important for the control of ib and nd however conventional live attenuated vaccines are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated chickens therefore there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious vaccines in this study using a previously established reverse genetics system we generated a recombinant ibv virus based on the ibv h120 vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn protein of ndv the recombinant virus r-h120-hn/5a exhibited growth dynamics pathogenicity and viral titers that were similar to those of the parental ibv h120 but it had acquired hemagglutination activity from ndv vaccination of spf chickens with the r-h120-hn/5a virus induced a humoral response at a level comparable to that of the lasota/h120 commercial bivalent vaccine and provided significant protection against challenge with virulent ibv and ndv in summary the results of this study indicate that the ibv h120 strain could serve as an effective tool for designing vaccines against ib and other infectious diseases and the generation of ibv r-h120-hn/5a provides a solid foundation for the development of an effective bivalent vaccine against ibv and ndv
from the perspective of vaccine development it is imperative to accurately diagnose target infections in order to exclude subjects with prior exposure from evaluations of vaccine effectiveness to track incident infection during the course of a clinical trial and to differentiate immune reactions due to natural infections from responses that are vaccine related when vaccine development is accelerated to a rapid pace in response to emerging infectious disease threats the challenges to develop such diagnostic tools is even greater this was observed through the recent expansion of zika virus infections into the western hemisphere in 2014-2017 when initial zika vaccine clinical trials were being designed and launched in response to the outbreak there were no standardized sets of viral and immunological assays and no approved diagnostic tests for zika virus infection the diagnosis of zika virus infection is still an area of active research and development on many fronts here we review emerging infectious disease vaccine clinical assay development and trial execution with a special focus on the state of zika virus clinical assays and diagnostics
the robustness of immune responses to an antigen could be dictated by the route of vaccine inoculation traditional smallpox vaccines essentially vaccinia virus strains that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation skin scarification the modified vaccinia virus ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in europe and canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the united states mva is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization since mva is replication-deficient mva and mvavectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular intradermal or subcutaneous routes vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the united states has needle phobia following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the new york city board of health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification we investigated whether mva and mva recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models our data suggest that mva administered by percutaneous inoculation elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation high titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant mva expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein d after scarification similarly a recombinant mva expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rga/viet nam/1203/2004 h5n1 elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification taken together our data suggest that mva and mva-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited
infectious disease epidemics match wars and natural disasters in their capacity to threaten lives and damage economies like sars previously and zika recently the ebola crisis in 2015 showed how vulnerable the world is to these epidemics with over 11000 people dying in the outbreak in addition to causing immense human suffering these epidemics particularly affect low-and middle-income countries many of these deadly infectious diseases that have epidemic potential can become global health emergencies in the absence of effective vaccines but very few vaccines against these threats have been developed to create proven medical products the measles vaccine is an efficient live attenuated replicating virus that has been safely administered to 2 billion children over the last 40 years affording life-long protection after a single dose taking advantage of these characteristics this attenuated virus was transformed into a versatile chimeric or recombinant vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-ofprinciple in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens clinical trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine platform in individuals with preexisting immunity to measles this review describes the potential of this platform to develop new vaccines against emerging viral diseases
background porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv has led to serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide in this study an oral recombinant lactobacillus casei vaccine against pedv infection targeting the intestinal microfold m cells and dendritic cells dcs for delivering the core neutralizing epitope coe of pedv spike protein was developed with m cell-targeting peptide col and dendritic cell-targeting peptide dcpep the immunogenicity of the orally administered recombinant strains was evaluated results after immunization significantly higher levels of anti-pedv specific igg antibodies with pedv neutralizing activity in the sera and mucosal siga antibodies in the tractus genitalis intestinal mucus and stools were detected in mice orally administered with the recombinant strain ppg-coe-col-dcpep/l393 which expressed dcpep and col targeting ligands fused with the pedv coe antigen compared to mice orally immunized with the recombinant strain ppg-coe/l393 without the dcpep and col targeting ligands moreover in response to restimulation with the pedv coe antigen in vitro a significant difference in splenocyte proliferation response and th2-associated cytokine il-4 level was observed in the group of mice orally immunized with ppg-coe-col-dcpep/l393 p < 0.05 compared to the groups of mice that received ppg-coe-col/l393 and ppg-coe-dcpep/l393 respectively the intestinal m cells-and dcs-targeting oral delivery of genetically engineered lactobacillus expressing the coe antigen of pedv can efficiently induce anti-pedv mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses via oral administration suggesting a promising vaccine strategy against pedv infection
significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne zika virus zikv recent studies suggest that zikv can also be transmitted sexually further increasing the exposure risk for this virus associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of zikv-infected mothers as well as a rise in the occurrence of guillain barre' syndrome in infected adults importantly there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against zikv infection in this study we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel synthetic dna vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins prme of zikv following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prme dna-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced dna delivery vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity in mice lacking receptors for interferon ifn-α/β designated ifnar − / − immunisation with this dna vaccine induced following in vivo viral challenge 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue in addition passive transfer of non-human primate anti-zikv immune serum protected ifnar − / − mice against subsequent viral challenge this study in nhp and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prme in zikv infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for zikv control and disease prevention in humans
current vaccines that provide protection against infectious diseases have primarily relied on attenuated or inactivated pathogens virus-like particles vlps comprised of capsid proteins that can initiate an immune response but do not include the genetic material required for replication promote immunogenicity and have been developed and approved as vaccines in some cases in addition many of these vlps can be used as molecular platforms for genetic fusion or chemical attachment of heterologous antigenic epitopes this approach has been shown to provide protective immunity against the foreign epitopes in many cases a variety of vlps and virus-based nanoparticles are being developed for use as vaccines and epitope platforms these particles have the potential to increase efficacy of current vaccines as well as treat diseases for which no effective vaccines are available
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv causes a severe clinical enteric disease in suckling neonates with up to 100% mortality resulting in devastating economic losses to the pork industry in recent years maternal immunity via colostrum and milk is a vital source to neonates of passive protection against diarrhea dehydration and death caused by pedv comprehensive information on neutralizing activity na against pedv in mammary secretions is critically important for assessing the protective capacity of sows therefore the objectives of this study were to characterize anti-pedv neutralizing activity in mammary secretions anti-pedv na was present in colostrum milk and serum from pedv-infected sows as determined both by immunofluorescence and elisa-based neutralizing assays with neutralization levels higher in colostrum and milk than in serum the highest na was observed in colostrum on day 1 and decreased rapidly in milk at day 3 then gradually declined from day 3 to day 19 post-farrowing notably the na in mammary secretions showed various patterns of decline over time of lactation that may contribute to variation in sow protective capacities the kinetics of na decline were associated with total iga and igg antibody levels neutralizing activity significantly correlated with specific iga primarily to spike domain 1 s1 and domain 2 s2 proteins of pedv rather than to specific igg in colostrum subsequently the na in milk was mainly related to specific iga to s1 and s2 during lactation
avian paramyxoviruses apmvs are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds throughout the world and are separated into nine serotypes apmv-1 to -9 only in the case of apmv-1 the infection of non-avian species has been investigated the apmvs presently are being considered as human vaccine vectors in this study we evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of all nine apmv serotypes in hamsters the hamsters were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for clinical disease pathology histopathology virus replication and seroconversion on the basis of one or more of these criteria each of the apmv serotypes was found to replicate in hamsters the apmvs produced mild or inapparent clinical signs in hamsters except for apmv-9 which produced moderate disease gross lesions were observed over the pulmonary surface of hamsters infected with apmv-2 & -3 which showed petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages respectively replication of all of the apmvs except apmv-5 was confirmed in the nasal turbinates and lungs indicating a tropism for the respiratory tract histologically the infection resulted in lung lesions consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity and nasal turbinates with blunting or loss of cilia of the epithelium lining the nasal septa the majority of apmv-infected hamsters exhibited transient histological lesions that self resolved by 14 days post infection dpi all of the hamsters infected with the apmvs produced serotype-specific hi or neutralizing antibodies confirming virus replication taken together these results demonstrate that all nine known apmv serotypes are capable of replicating in hamsters with minimal disease and pathology
the receptor-binding domains rbds located in toxin a and toxin b of clostridium difficile are known to be nontoxic and immunogenic we need to develop a new type vaccine based on rbds in this study we expressed and purified recombinant proteins named rbd-tcda and rbd-tcdb as vaccine candidates containing the rbds of toxin a and toxin b respectively from the c difficile reference strain vpi10463 the immunogenicity and protection of the vaccine candidates rbd-tcda rbd-tcdb and rbd-tcda/b was evaluated by elisa and survival assays the data indicated that mice immunized with all vaccine candidates displayed potent levels of rbd-specific serum igg following intramuscular immunization of mice with rbd-tcda and/or rbd-tcdb these vaccine candidates triggered immune responses that protected mice compared to mice immunized with aluminum hydroxide alone taken together the results of this study reveal that recombinant proteins containing rbds of c difficile toxins can be used for vaccine development additionally we found that an rbd-tcda/b vaccine can elicit a stronger humoral immune response and provide better immunoprotection than the univalent vaccines this rbd vaccine candidate conferred significant protection against disease symptoms and death caused by toxins from a wild-type c difficile strain
astroviruses are known to infect humans and a wide range of animal species and can cause gastroenteritis in their hosts recent studies have reported astroviruses in bats in europe and in several locations in china we sampled 1876 bats from 17 genera at 45 sites from 14 and 13 provinces in cambodia and lao pdr respectively and tested them for astroviruses our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various yangochiroptera and yinpterochiroptera bats evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found furthermore additional pteropodid hosts were detected the astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus mamastrovirus most closely related to other known bat astroviruses the astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully an astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts including from ungulates and porcupines was found in a rousettus bat these findings suggest that diverse astroviruses can be found in many species of mammals including bats
in 2005 human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 was isolated and identified from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia in hong kong to identify and classify genotypes of hcov-hku1 in korea a sensitive specific and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr assay was developed and analyzed the sequences of hcov-hku1 isolated in korea a total of 1985 respiratory specimens taken from patients with acute respiratory illness were tested for hcov-hku1 from january 2007 to may 2008 the major clinical symptoms associated with hcov-hku1 infection were examined statistically and sequence variations of the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp spike and nucleocapsid genes were also analyzed fifty cases 2.5% hcov-hku1 were identified by real-time pcr and viral loads ranged from 6.7 â 10 4 to 1.6 â 10 9 copies/ml the clinical symptoms of hcov-hku1 infection included rhinorrhea 72% cough 64% nasal congestion 56% fever 32% sputum 30% sore throat 18% chills 16% postnasal discharge 14% and tonsillar hypertrophy 10%. there was a seasonal distribution of hcov-hku1 infection peaking in winter and spring both genotypes a and b were detected but no recombination between them was found this is the first report on the identification and genotyping of hcov-hku1 as a causative agent of acute respiratory illness in korea the data suggest that at least two genotypes a and b of hcov-hku1 with scattered silent mutations were circulating in korea from 2007 to 2008
infectious diseases that are transmitted from wildlife hosts to humans such as the ebola virus and mers virus can be difficult to understand because the pathogens emerge from complex multifaceted ecological interactions we use a wildlife-pathogen system-prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus and the plague bacterium yersinia pestis-to describe aspects of disease ecology that apply to many cases of emerging infectious disease we show that the monitoring and surveillance of hosts and vectors during the buildup to disease outbreaks are crucial for understanding pathogen-transmission dynamics and that a community-ecology framework is important to identify reservoir hosts incorporating multidisciplinary approaches and frameworks may improve wildlife-pathogen surveillance and our understanding of seemingly sporadic and rare pathogen outbreaks
zika virus zikv a mosquito-borne flavivirus discovered in 1947 has only recently caused large outbreaks and emerged as a significant human pathogen in 2015 zikv was detected in brazil and the resulting epidemic has spread throughout the western hemisphere severe complications from zikv infection include neurological disorders such as guillain-barré syndrome in adults and a variety of fetal abnormalities including microcephaly blindness placental insufficiency and fetal demise there is an urgent need for tools and reagents to study the pathogenesis of epidemic zikv and for testing vaccines and antivirals using a reverse genetics platform we generated six zikv infectious clones and derivative viruses representing diverse temporal and geographic origins these include three versions of mr766 the prototype 1947 strain with and without a glycosylation site in the envelope protein and h/pf/2013 a 2013 human isolate from french polynesia representative of the virus introduced to brazil in the course of synthesizing a clone of a circulating brazilian strain phylogenetic studies identified two distinct zikv clades in brazil we reconstructed viable clones of strains sph2015 and beh819015 representing ancestral members of each clade we assessed recombinant virus replication binding to monoclonal antibodies and virulence in mice this panel of molecular clones and recombinant virus isolates will enable targeted studies of viral determinants of pathogenesis adaptation and evolution as well as the rational attenuation of contemporary outbreak strains to facilitate the design of vaccines and therapeutics
the role of non-cytomegalovirus cmv enteric viral infection in causing diarrhoea in patients with human immunode®ciency virus hiv is poorly understood we aimed to investigate the prevalence of these infections in acute and chronic diarrhoea stool specimens from 377 hiv-infected patients presenting with diarrhoea were studied prospectively for evidence of non-cmv enteric viral infection patients with diarrhoea underwent investigation for gastrointestinal pathogens including electron microscopic examination of stool for enteric viruses we collected data on patients in whom enteric virus was identi®ed and examined the association of enteric virus infection with diarrhoeal symptomatology eighty-nine 10.3% stool specimens from 60 15.9% hiv + individuals were positive for coronavirus n = 13 22% rotavirus n = 11 18% adenovirus n = 30 50% and small round structured viruses n = 5 8% or dual infection n = 2 3%. thirty-four of 52 65% patients available for analysis had acute diarrhoea and 18/52 35% had chronic diarrhoea twentythree of 52 44% patients had a concurrent gut pathogen after exclusion of concurrent pathogens enteric viral infections were found to be signi®cantly associated with acute as opposed to chronic diarrhoea p = 0.004 the presence of adenovirus colitis was signi®cantly more likely to be associated with chronic diarrhoea 15/21 cases than adenovirus isolated from stool alone 9/23 cases p = 0.03 there was a trend towards an association between adenovirus colitis and colonic cytomegalovirus infection p = 0.06 enteric viral infection is strongly associated with acute diarrhoea in patients with hiv light microscopic examination of large bowel biopsies can identify adenovirus colitis which is signi®cantly associated with chronic diarrhoea and in addition may facilitate gastrointestinal coinfection with cmv
coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory enteric and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man mammals fish and avian
a b s t r a c t rna viruses have been associated with enteritis in poultry and have been isolated from diseased birds the same viral agents have also been detected in healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease in order to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles which do not involve the use of density gradients for generating viral metagenome data in this study the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for rna viruses from the gastrointestinal tract in addition with the use of the best method and increased sequencing depth a glimpse of the rna viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is presented the viruses from the reoviridae and astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified the rarefaction curve at the species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was included with the increased sequencing depth implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance
dengue is the most common arthropodborne infection worldwide affecting at least 50 million people every year and endemic in more than 100 countries the dengue virus is a single-stranded rna virus with four major serotypes infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease the major route of transmission occurs through the aedes aegypti mosquito vector but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection undifferentiated fever dengue fever dengue haemorrhagic fever dhf to dengue shock syndrome dss dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks a trend has also been observed towards 1 these authors contributed equally to this work
intestinal infection with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec is an important disease in swine resulting in significant economic losses knowledge about the epidemiology the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease the etec causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae f4 k88 f5 k99 f6 987p or f41 while the etec of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae f4 k88 and f18 these fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells enterocytes starting the process of enteric infection after this colonization the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea such as the heat stable toxin a sta the heat stable toxin b stb and the heat labile toxin lt a role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins the diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic e coli coupled with the demonstration by pcr of the genes encoding for virulence factors fimbriae and toxins the diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak among the different methods of control of colibacillosis the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs an accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the etec responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated e coli it is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among e coli isolates growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers
coxsackievirus b5 cv-b5 an important coxsackie b virus from genus enteroviruse within the family picornaviridae has also been isolated from hand foot and mouth disease hfmd patients and often associated with neurological manifestations in this study we found out that coxsackievirus b3 cv-b3 replicon rna could be encapsidated with cv-b5 capsid to assemble infectious cv-b5 pseudovirus we then utilized this single round infection system of cv-b5 to develop a neutralizing antibody quantification assay this pseudovirus neutralization assay showed superiority in biosafety sensibility quantitativity efficiency and high throughput and would facilitate the epidemiological studies and vaccine development of cv-b5
the cross-species transmission of viruses into new host populations termed virus emergence is a significant issue in public health agriculture wildlife management and related fields virus emergence requires overlap between host populations alterations in virus genetics to permit infection of new hosts and adaptation to novel hosts such that between-host transmission is sustainable all of which are the purview of the fields of ecology and evolution a firm understanding of the ecology of viruses and how they evolve is required for understanding how and why viruses emerge in this paper i address the evolutionary mechanisms of virus emergence and how they relate to virus ecology i argue that while virus acquisition of the ability to infect new hosts is not difficult limited evolutionary trajectories to sustained virus between-host transmission and the combined effects of mutational meltdown bottlenecking demographic stochasticity density dependence and genetic erosion in ecological sinks limit most emergence events to dead-end spillover infections despite the relative rarity of pandemic emerging viruses the potential of viruses to search evolutionary space and find means to spread epidemically and the consequences of pandemic viruses that do emerge necessitate sustained attention to virus research surveillance prophylaxis and treatment
recombinant adeno-associated viral raav vectors promote long-term gene transfer in many animal species significant effort has focused on the evaluation of raav delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease however canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus cpv raav and cpv possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses thus any immune response generated to cpv vaccination has the potential to cross-react with raav vectors in this study we investigated the immune response to raav6 delivery in a cohort of cpv-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of cpv-vaccination we show that cpv-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to raav6 in addition no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the raav6-directed immune response between cpv-vaccinated animals and controls moreover cpv-vaccination did not inhibit raav6-mediated transduction we also evaluated the immune response to early raav6vaccination in neonatal mice the influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate we hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to raav6 when delivered during the neonatal period mice were vaccinated with raav6 at 1 or 5 days of age and subsequently challenged with raav6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential im injections 1 month apart all vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to raav6vaccination that was enhanced following im injection in adulthood taken together these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against raav6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice
background the nasal avian schistosome trichobilharzia regenti spends part of its intravertebrate period of life within the central nervous system migration of the parasites can be accompanied by neuromotor disorders or paralysis in natural definitive hosts ducks and even in laboratory mammals cercariae are also able to penetrate human skin and induce cercarial dermatitis while the cellular and antibody responses against cercariae and migrating schistosomula have been investigated in mice little is known about immune reactions in birds this study first describes the dynamics of antibody response in infected ducks and identifies frequently recognized antigens that may serve as diagnostic markers of infection by t regenti methods groups of 35 domestic ducks and 10 mallards were exposed to different doses of t regenti cercariae sera were collected at predefined time intervals and tested by elisa for the presence of specific anti-cercarial igy and igm antigens recognized by the antibodies were identified on western blots of cercariae and schistosomula the applicability in immunodiagnostics was statistically evaluated by expression of specificity and sensitivity values for individual antigens results in elisa the levels of anti-cercarial igm peaked on day 15 pi increased production of igy associated with the later phases of infection was observed in most individuals around 20 dpi and culminated 30 dpi the time course of antibody response did not differ among experimental groups variations were only observed in the levels of specific igy which depended rather on the age of ducks at the time of infection than on the infectious dose on western blots 40 cercarial and 7 schistosomular antigens were recognized by igy from infected ducks among them 4 cercarial antigens of 50 47 32 and 19 kda provided the most sensitive and specific reactions conclusions antigens of cercariae and schistosomula elicited distinct antibody response in ducks which correlated positively with the age of animals at the time of infection several antigens originating in cercariae and fewer in schistosomula were recognized by igy with diverse sensitivity and specificity only a few seemed to be common to both stages four of them were considered as the most promising candidates for immunodiagnostics
crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever cchf is a severe tick-borne disease endemic in many countries in africa the middle east eastern europe and asia between 15-70% of reported cases are fatal there is no approved vaccine available and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously in the present study the attenuated poxvirus vector modified vaccinia virus ankara was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the cchf virus glycoproteins cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains including type i interferon receptor knockout mice which are susceptible to cchf disease this vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus even though they did not exhibit clinical signs this is the first demonstration of efficacy of a cchf vaccine
virus-like particles vlps are highly organised spheres that self-assemble from virus-derived structural antigens these stable and versatile subviral particles possess excellent adjuvant properties capable of inducing innate and cognate immune responses commercialised vlp-based vaccines have been successful in protecting humans from hepatitis b virus hbv and human papillomavirus hpv infection and are currently explored for their potential to combat other infectious diseases and cancer much insight into vlp-mediated immune stimulation and optimised vlp design has been gained from human immunodeficiency virus hiv-derived vlps presenting promising components of current aids vaccine approaches owing to their unique features vlps and virosomes the in vitro-reconstituted vlp counterparts have recently gained ground in the field of nanobiotechnology as organic templates for the development of new biomaterials addresses
alpacas vicugna pacos a species of south american camelids sac suffer high morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases diarrhea is one of the leading causes of alpaca cria mortality in peru and elsewhere in order to develop appropriate control and/or treatment it is necessary to identify infectious pathogens that cause diarrhea in crias rotavirus was isolated in cell culture from feces collected from crias with acute diarrhea that tested positive to rotaviral antigen by rapid immunochromatographic methods in an earlier study the isolates were identified as rotaviruses by rt-pcr run with specific primers for human rotavirus vp7 coding sequences using total rna extracted from cells displaying cytopathic effects as template these alpaca isolates were further identified as group a rotaviruses by means of a vp6-specific pcr and were designated as alrva-k'ayra/perú/3368-10 and alrva-k'ayra/ perú/3386-10 molecular g and p typing placed the former as g3/p11 and the latter as g3/p sequence analysis of two genome segments coding for vp4 and vp7 from the alpaca isolates revealed partial homologies to swine and human rotaviruses respectively these results demonstrate that rotaviruses are associated with a proportion of cases of diarrhea in crias although prevalence and impact remain to be determined the isolation of rotaviruses from alpaca crias with diarrhea will contribute positively to further understand the pathogen and its role in the diarrhea complex
in this study we describe the detection of novel paramyxoviruses from the eidolon helvum species of fruit bats we extracted rna from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in zambia over a period of 4 years 2008200920102011 semi-nested rt-pcr detected a total of 25 8% positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis among the positive samples seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected five viruses were closely related to the genus henipavirus while two viruses were related to the unclassified bat paramyxoviruses from ghana and congo brazzaville our study identified novel henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using rt-pcr in fruit bats from kansaka national park and indicated the presence of similar bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses the presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk
viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results our data suggest that rspv-st is potentially an effective vaccine against infection with emerging pedv strains
epidermal growth factor egf promotes gastrointestinal mucosal recovery by stimulating the mitogenic activity of intestinal crypt epithelial cells the aim of this study was to determine the effects of egf on atrophic enteritis induced in piglets by experimental infection with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv strain dr13 two groups of 12 conventional colostrum-deprived 1-day-old large white-duroc cross breed piglets were inoculated orally with pedv 3 · 10 5 50% tissue culture infective doses with or without egf 10 lg/kg/day intraperitoneally once daily for 4 days after infection and compared to 12 uninfected untreated control piglets pedv + egf piglets had less severe clinical signs than pedv only piglets at 48 and 60 h post-infection hpi histologically the ratio of villous heightcrypt depth of pedv + egf piglets was significantly higher than pedv only piglets at 36 and 48 hpi immunohistochemistry for ki67 demonstrated increased proliferation in intestinal crypt epithelial cells of pedv + egf piglets compared to pedv only piglets at 36 48 and 60 hpi egf stimulates proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells and promotes recovery from atrophic enteritis in pedv-infected piglets
the sars-associated human coronavirus sars-hcov is a newly described emerging virus conclusively established as the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars this study presents a single-tube rt-pcr assay that can detect with high analytical sensitivity the sars-hcov as well as several other coronaviruses including other known human respiratory coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e species identification is provided by sequencing the amplicon although a rapid screening test by restriction enzyme analysis has proved to be very useful for the analysis of samples obtained during the sars outbreak in toronto canada
sars-cov-2 commonly termed covid-19 for the illness it causes has infected >3.2 million people including >220000 deaths human milk igg originates mainly from blood therefore a sars-cov-2-reactive antibody ab response in milk would be expected 1 however igg comprises only ~2% of milk ab with most milk abs originating from mucosa-associated
bird to human transmission of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus hpaiv poses a significant risk of triggering a flu pandemic in the human population therefore vaccination of susceptible poultry during an hpaiv outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions to this end suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge the aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants two adjuvants namely bacterium-like particles blp and advax were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that blp and advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up blp and advax/blp adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the nonadjuvanted formulation remarkably all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the advax group overall our results indicate that passive inhalation is feasible effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens if it can be adapted to field settings
background more knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases in this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores a badger meles meles a mongoose herpestes ichneumon and an otter lutra lutra from portugal results we detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed such as five gemycircularviruses four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger in addition we also identified an rna-dependent rna polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter conclusions together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution
background infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease which causes tracheal lesions and also affects the reproductive tract and is responsible for large economic losses to the poultry industry every year this is due to both mortality either directly provoked by ibv itself or due to subsequent bacterial infection and lost egg production the virus is difficult to control by vaccination so new methods to curb the impact of the disease need to be sought here we seek to identify genes conferring resistance to this coronavirus which could help in selective breeding programs to rear chickens which do not succumb to the effects of this disease methods whole genome gene expression microarrays were used to analyse the gene expression differences which occur upon infection of birds with infectious bronchitis virus ibv tracheal tissue was examined from control and infected birds at 2 3 and 4 days post-infection in birds known to be either susceptible or resistant to the virus the host innate immune response was evaluated over these 3 days and differences between the susceptible and resistant lines examined results genes and biological pathways involved in the early host response to ibv infection were determined andgene expression differences between susceptible and resistant birds were identified potential candidate genes for resistance to ibv are highlighted conclusions the early host response to ibv is analysed and potential candidate genes for disease resistance are identified these putative resistance genes can be used as targets for future genetic and functional studies to prove a causative link with resistance to ibv
aquatic birds harbor diverse influenza a viruses and are a major viral reservoir in nature the recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new h17n10 subtype in central american fruit bats suggests that other new world species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses using consensus degenerate rt-pcr we identified a novel influenza a virus designated as h18n11 in a flat-faced fruit bat artibeus planirostris from peru serologic studies with the recombinant h18 protein indicated that several peruvian bat species were infected by this virus phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that in some gene segments new world bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined indicative of a long-standing host-virus association structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release suggesting a unique mode of influenza a virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells taken together these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses
the employment of live attenuated vaccines has a long-standing record in human and veterinary medicine most of the vaccines in current use were empirically developed during the last century today due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible moreover live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors in each case the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity antigen synthesis antigen release and safety aspects have to be integrated a range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics but very few have been approved so far in many cases further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles in the present chapter we focus on current strategies which are employed for the development of new and the optimization of first generation recombinant live vaccines based on bacteria and viruses
one cross-sectional study describing the clinicopathologic abnormalities in 24 dogs seropositive to bartonella vinsonii ssp berkhoffi was identified three of 4 anemic dogs tested were coombs'-positive 1 yielding an ime value of 3.81 bartonella spp induce imha is low as the range of pathogenesis for this organism is still emerging further prospective controlled studies are needed to address this question borrelia spp one retrospective study described 1 dog with imha that was seropositive for b burgdorferi a phagocytophilium and r rickettsii 2 owing to the co-exposure status evidence for b burgdorferi as a cause of imha could not be evaluated in a separate study a coombs'positive anemia was documented in a dog with borrelia turicatae spirochetemia 3 yielding an ime value of 2.37 based on isolated case reports the overall evidence that borrelia spp infection induces imha is negligible considering that borrelia infection in dogs is associated with other immune-mediated conditions notably polyarthritis 4 future prospective
infectious bronchitis virus ibv is an endemic disease of chickens and a major contributor to economic losses for the poultry industry despite vaccination recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for ibv therefore we hypothesized that early ibv vaccination will generate an immature poorly protective ibv-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of ibv to test this hypothesis the ibv-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages this demonstrated a delayed production of igg and iga plasma antibodies in the 1 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower iga antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group similar observations were made for antibodies in tears in addition igg antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds the delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower igg avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon ibv field strain challenge the lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected these data strongly support ibv vaccination after day 7 post hatch
the hsv-1 envelope glycoprotein b gb plays a critical role in virus entry into host cells neutralizing antibodies can therefore potentially prevent virus entry into target cells and cell-to-cell spread of infection our present study focused on the selection of neutralizing single-chain fv scfv antibodies of a phage-displayed nonimmune human scfv antibody library against gb of hsv-1 to enrich specific scfvs two phage antibodies were isolated against amino acid residues 31-43 derived from the n-terminal part of gb using panning technique two scfvs scfv-gb 1 and scfv-gb 2 with frequencies of 45% and 20% were obtained from scfv clones after performing pcr and mvai fingerprinting in phage elisa analysis both gb 1 and gb 2 scfvs demonstrated high reactivity with the gb peptide in the neutralization assay scfv-gb 1 and scfv-gb 2 represented neutralizing effects of 55% and 59% respectively upon further enhancement of the neutralizing effects of these antibodies they can be considered as new potential alternatives in the treatment and prophylaxis of hsv-1 infections
knowledge of immunodominant regions in major viral antigens is important for rational design of effective vaccines and diagnostic tests although there have been many reports of such work done for sars-cov these were mainly focused on the immune responses of humans and mice in this study we aim to search for and compare immunodominant regions of the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins which are recognized by sera from different animal species including mouse rat rabbit civet pig and horse twelve overlapping recombinant protein fragments were produced in escherichia coli six each for the s and n proteins which covered the entire coding region of the two proteins using a membrane-strip based western blot approach the reactivity of each antigen fragment against a panel of animal sera was determined immunodominant regions containing linear epitopes which reacted with sera from all the species tested were identified for both proteins the s3 fragment aa 402-622 and the n4 fragment aa 220-336 were the most immunodominant among the six s and n fragments respectively antibodies raised against the s3 fragment were able to block the binding of a panel of s-specific monoclonal antibodies mab to sars-cov in elisa further demonstrating the immunodominance of this region based on these findings one-step competition elisas were established which were able to detect sars-cov antibodies from human and at least seven different animal species considering that a large number of animal species are known to be susceptible to sars-cov these assays will be a useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of sars-cov and to minimise the risk of animal-to-human transmission
viruslike particles grouped in clusters not bound by a membrane were seen in electron micrographs of fresh leucoblasts of an acute leukemic patient they consisted of large 100-nm diameter round particles apparently composed of subunits tubular structures 30-50-nm diameter were also seen in leucoblasts of the same patient the two types of structures were never seen simultaneously in the same cell the authors review the literature pertaining to the morphology of virus-like particles associated with malignant hematologic disease
in vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence and although the precise mechanisms are not clear it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity under-or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence the objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population malnutrition and obesity sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species guinea pigs viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling histopathology viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species additionally nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population in particular an n1124d change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals in vivo comparison of an 1124d plaque isolate to a clone with 1124n genotype indicated that 1124d was associated with increased virulence
the combination of sorting antigen-specific memory b cells with determining immunoglobulin ig genes at the single-cell level enables the isolation of monoclonal antibodies mabs in individuals this method requires a small amount of blood usually 10 ml and is rapid less than 2 weeks to isolate antigen-specific mabs due to the application of antigens as the bait to capture the specific memory b cells the majority of isolated mabs are true binders to the antigen which increases the isolation efficiency here applying this approach we describe the characterization of mabs against zika virus from a convalescent patient sample from 10 ml whole blood we sorted 33 zika envelope e protein-interacting single memory b cells the ig genes from 15 cells were determined and 13 mabs were found that bind to zika e protein with varied binding affinities
human papillomavirus hpv occurs in many types some of which cause cervical genital and other cancers while vaccination is available against the major cancer-causing hpv types many others are not covered by these preventive measures herein we present a bioinformatics study for the designing of multivalent peptide vaccines against multiple hpv types as an alternative strategy to the virus-like particle vaccines being used now our technique of rational design of peptide vaccines is expected to ensure stability of the vaccine against many cycles of mutational changes elicit immune response and negate autoimmune possibilities using the l1 capsid protein sequences we identified several peptides for potential vaccine design for hpv 16 18 33 35 45 and 11 types although there are concerns about the epitope-binding affinities for the peptides identified in this process the technique indicates possi bilities of multivalent adjuvanted peptide vaccines against a wider range of hpv types and tailor-made different combinations of the peptides to address frequency variations of types over different population groups as required for prophylaxis and at lower cost than are in use at the present time
background ticks are primary vectors for many well-known disease-causing agents that affect human and animal populations globally such as tick-borne encephalitis crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever and african swine fever in this study viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in rhipicephalus spp ticks collected in the zambezi valley of mozambique methods the rna was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification sispa and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the ion torrent platform the generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by blast codoncode aligner and seqman were used to assemble the sequences results the majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the orthomyxoviridae family although viruses similar to the parvoviridae and coronaviridae were also identified nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments ha np pb1 pb2 and pa were obtained and these showed an amino acid identity of 32-52% to known quaranjaviruses the sequences were most closely related to the wellfleet bay virus detected and isolated from common eider during a mortality event in the usa conclusions in summary this study has identified a highly divergent virus with in the orthomyxoviridae family associated with rhipicephalus ticks from mozambique further genetic and biological studies are needed in order to investigate potential pathogenesis of the identified orthomyxovirus article history
human prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation in the brain of proteinase k pkresistant prion protein designated prp27 -30 detectable by the 3f4 antibody against human prp109 -112 we recently identified a new pk-resistant prp species designated prp* 20 in uninfected human and animal brains it was preferentially detected with the 1e4 antibody against human prp 97 -108 but not with the anti-prp 3f4 antibody although the 3f4 epitope is adjacent to the 1e4 epitope in the prp* 20 molecule the present study reveals that removal of the nterminal amino acids up to residue 91 significantly increases accessibility of the 1e4 antibody to prp of brains and cultured cells in contrast to cells expressing wild-type prp cells expressing pathogenic mutant prp accumulate not only prp* 20 but also a small amount of 3f4-detected pk-resistant prp27 -30 remarkably during the course of human prion disease a transition from an increase in 1e4-detected prp* 20 to the occurrence of the 3f4-detected prp27 -30 was observed our study suggests that an increase in the level of prp* 20 characterizes the early stages of prion diseases preparation of recombinant human prp recombinant human prion protein prp23 -231 and prp90 -231 were prepared as previously described . in brief 632 j yuan et al
the immunogenicity and the efficacy of a beta-propiolactone-inactivated caprine herpesvirus 1 cphv-1 vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 tm were tested in goats following two subcutaneous immunizations goats developed high titers of cphv-1-specific serum and vaginal igg and high serum virus neutralization vn titers peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc stimulated in vitro with inactivated cphv-1 produced high levels of soluble ifn-gamma and exhibited high frequencies of ifn-gamma producing cells while soluble il-4 was undetectable on the other hand control goats receiving the inactivated cphv-1 vaccine without adjuvant produced only low serum antibody responses a vaginal challenge with virulent cphv-1 was performed in all vaccinated goats and in naïve goats to assess the efficacy of the two vaccines vaginal disease was not detected in goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm and these animals had undetectable levels of infectious challenge virus in their vaginal washes goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 in the absence of adjuvant exhibited a less severe disease when compared to naïve goats but shed titers of challenge virus that were similar to those of naïve goats detection and quantitation of latent cphv-1 dna in sacral ganglia in challenged goats revealed that the inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm vaccine was able to significantly reduce the latent viral load when compared either to the naïve goats or to the goats vaccinated with inactivated cphv-1 in the absence of adjuvant thus a vaccine composed of inactivated cphv-1 plus mf59 tm as adjuvant was strongly immunogenic and induced effective immunity against vaginal cphv-1 infection in goats
to test the potential for parainfluenza virus 5 piv5-based vectors to provide protection from vaccinia virus vacv infection piv5 was engineered to express secreted vacv l1r and b5r proteins two important antigens for neutralization of intracellular mature imv and extracellular enveloped eev virions respectively protection of mice from lethal intranasal vacv challenge required intranasal immunization with piv5-l1r/b5r in a prime-boost protocol and correlated with low vacv-induced pathology in the respiratory tract and anti-vacv neutralizing antibody mice immunized with piv5-l1r/b5r showed some disease symptoms following vacv challenge such as loss of weight and hunching but these symptoms were delayed and less severe than with unimmunized control mice while immunization with piv5 expressing b5r alone conferred at least some protection the most effective immunization included the piv5 vector expressing l1r alone or in combination with piv5-b5r piv5-l1r/b5r vectors elicited protection from vacv challenge even when cd8+ cells were depleted but not in the case of mice that were defective in b cell production mice were protected from vacv challenge out to at least 1.5 years after immunization with piv5-l1r/b5r vectors and showed significant levels of anti-vacv neutralizing antibodies these results demonstrate the potential for piv5-based vectors to provide long lasting protection against complex human respiratory pathogens such as vacv but also highlight the need to understand mechanisms for the generation of strong immune responses against poorly immunogenic viral proteins
ebola virus ebov is the most virulent pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with high 27 mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates the postexposure antibody therapies to 28 prevent ebov infection are considered efficient however due to the poor thermal stability of 29 mammalian antibody their application in the tropics has been limited here we developed a 30 thermostable therapeutic antibody against ebov based on chicken immunoglobulin y igy the igy antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability which retained their neutralizing 32 activity at 25°c for one year in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies 33 mabs we immunized laying hens with a variety of ebov vaccine candidates and confirmed 34 that vsvδg/ebovgp encoding the ebov glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing 35 antibodies against ebov the therapeutic efficacy of immune igy antibodies in vivo was 36 evaluated in the newborn balb/c mice model lethal dose of virus challenged mice were treated 37 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-ebov igy
emerging viruses such as ebola virus ebov lassa virus lasv and avian influenza virus h5n1 aiv are global health concerns since there is very limited options either vaccine or specific therapy approved for humans against these viruses there is an urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic treatments previously we reported a high-throughput screening hts protocol to identify entry inhibitors for three highly pathogenic viruses ebov lasv and aiv using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyping platform which allows us to perform the screening in a bsl-2 facility in this report we have adopted this screening protocol to evaluate traditional chinese medicines tcms in an effort to discover entry inhibitors against these viruses here we show that extracts of the following chinese medicinal herbs exhibit potent anti-ebola viral activities gardenia jasminoides ellis citrus aurantium l viola yedoensis makino prunella vulgaris l coix lacryma-jobi l var mayuen roman stapf pinellia ternata thunb breit and morus alba l this study represents a proof-of-principle investigation supporting the suitability of this assay for rapid screening tcms and identifying putative entry inhibitors for these viruses
recently emerged zikv is associated with severe neurological complications 41 such as guillain-barré syndrome in adults and congenital microcephaly in 42 newborns no zikv-specific therapeutics or vaccines are currently available 43 we and others have identified a number of neutralizing antibodies capable of 44 protecting experimental animals from zikv infection however the 3 45 development of these potent antibodies during zikv natural infection remains 46 unknown here we report on the longitudinal analysis of one such antibody 47 zk2b10 using next-generation sequencing ngs bioinformatics and 48 functional analysis we found that the zk2b10 germline-like antibodies 49 possess strong neutralizing activity in vitro and impressive protectivity against 50 lethal zikv infection in vivo these findings suggest that the potent and 51 protective antibody response against zikv can be generated within relative 52 short term with high germline identity which provide great hope and promise for 53 successful vaccine development against zikv.54
animals were immunized with transmissible gastroenteritis virus conjugated with gold nanoparticles the resultant antibodies had a higher titer than antibodies produced in response to native virus immunization with the antigen-colloidal gold complex led to a signifi cant increase of the peritoneal macrophages respiratory activity and of plasma ifn-γ level in immunized animals
serological assays for anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis guide epidemiological intervention and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration we developed and validated new anti-sars-cov-2 igg igm and iga elisa tests enzy-well sars-cov-2 elisa diesse diagnostica senese s p a based on whole-virus antigens we used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from covid-19 suspected and confirmed cases healthy donors and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions overall the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity especially for igg and iga we observed high sensitivity 92.5 and 93.6% respectively specificity was high >96% for all antibody types elisas in addition sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset dso due to the seroconversion window and for enzy-well sars-cov-2 igg and iga . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review medrxiv preprint 2 elisas resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 dso respectively the results showed that enzy-well sars-cov-2 elisas may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes covering all different antibody types developed in sars-cov-2 immune response
infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes a major disease problem for the poultry industry worldwide the currently used live-attenuated vaccines have the tendency to mutate and/or recombine with circulating field strains resulting in the emergence of vaccine-derived variant viruses in order to circumvent these issues and to develop a vaccine that is more relevant to egypt and its neighboring countries a recombinant avirulent newcastle disease virus rndv strain lasota was constructed to express the codon-optimized s glycoprotein of the egyptian ibv variant strain ibv/ck/eg/ cu/4/2014 belonging to gi-23 lineage that is prevalent in egypt and in the middle east a wild type and two modified versions of the ibv s protein were expressed individually by rndv a high level of s protein expression was detected in vitro by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses all rndv-vectored ibv vaccine candidates were genetically stable slightly attenuated and showed growth patterns comparable to that of parental rlasota virus single-dose vaccination of 1-day-old spf white leghorn chicks with the rndvs expressing ibv s protein provided significant protection against clinical disease after ibv challenge but did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding single-dose vaccination also provided complete protection against virulent ndv challenge however prime-boost vaccination using rndv expressing the wild type ibv s protein provided better protection after ibv challenge against clinical signs and significantly reduced tracheal viral shedding these results indicate that the ndv-vectored ibv vaccines are promising bivalent vaccine candidates to control both infectious bronchitis and newcastle disease in egypt
the ongoing battle against current and rising viral infectious threats has prompted increasing effort in the development of vaccine technology a major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing herein a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles svlps is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen svlps were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins following removal of free proteins antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy as compared to inoculation with free proteins vaccination with the svlps showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery stronger antibody titers increased splenic t-cell response and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the svlps the study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture
rabies is progressive fatal encephalitis who estimates 55000 rabies deaths and more than 10 million pep every year world-wide a variety of cell-culture derived vaccines are available for prophylaxis against rabies however their high cost restricts their usage in developing countries where such cases are most often encountered this is driving the quest for newer vaccine formulations dna vaccines being most promising amongst them here we explored strategies of antigen trafficking to various cellular compartments aiming at improving both humoral and cellular immunity these strategies include use of signal sequences namely tissue plasminogen activator tpa ubiquitin uq and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 lamp-1 tpa lamp-1 and their combination were aimed at enhancing the cd4 + t cell and antibody response in contrast the uq tag was utilized for enhancing cd8 + response the potency of modified dna vaccines assessed by total antibody response antibody isotypes cytokine profile neutralizing antibody titer and protection conferred against in vivo challenge was enhanced in comparison to native unmodified vaccine but the response elicited did not pertain to the type of target sequence and the directed arm of immunity interestingly the dna vaccines that had been designed to generate different type of immune responses yielded in effect similar response in conclusion our data indicate that the directing target sequence is not the exclusive deciding factor for type and extent of immune response elicited and emphasizes on the antigen dependence of immune enhancement strategies
background in china large-scale outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by viruses have occurred in pigs since late 2010 to investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in southern china during 2012-2018 were tested results porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples and 96.43% 162/168 in premises respectively porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples and 70.24% 118/168 in premises respectively both transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and porcine rotavirus porv were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises in this study we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov in diarrheal samples of piglets from fujian province in southern china and the prevalence rate of sads-cov was 10.29% 7/68 co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common the most frequent co-infection was pedv with pdcov with an average detection rate of 12.72% 380/2987 ranging from 8.26-17.33%. phylogenetic analysis revealed that pedvs circulating in southern china during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of pedv in genotype iia the most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent coe and epitope regions of the spike gene of the pedvs currently circulating in the field genetic relationships of pdcovs were closely related with chinese strains other than those present in the usa south korea thailand and lao's public conclusions the findings of this study indicated that variant pedv pdcov and sads-cov were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric covs were common in pigs in southern china during 2012-2018 thus significant attention should be paid in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea
dengue virus denv is transmitted by infectious mosquitoes during blood-feeding via saliva containing biologically-active proteins here we examined the effect of varying denv infection modality in rhesus macaques in order to improve the denv nonhuman primate nhp challenge model nhps were exposed to denv-1 via subcutaneous or intradermal inoculation of virus only intradermal inoculation of virus and salivary gland extract or infectious mosquito feeding the infectious mosquito feeding group exhibited delayed onset of viremia greater viral loads and altered clinical and immune responses compared to other groups after 15 months nhps in the subcutaneous and infectious mosquito feeding groups were re-exposed to either denv-1 or denv-2 viral replication and neutralizing antibody following homologous challenge were suggestive of sterilizing immunity whereas heterologous challenge resulted in productive yet reduced denv-2 replication and boosted neutralizing antibody these results show that a more transmission-relevant exposure modality resulted in viral replication closer to that observed in humans
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndromeprrs caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virusprrsv is one of the most infectious diseases in the swine industry worldwide causing big economic losses vaccines are major weapons against prrsv however current available vaccines have several limitations developing chemical drugs as alternatives is required on the basis of traditional medical knowledge we purposely selected 15 natural products originated from chinese herbs with anti-infectious effects their antiviral activities were evaluated by prrsv-induced cytopathic effectcpe on marc-145 cells and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionrt-pcr assay compounds ethoxysanguinarineeosg and atractylodinol were found to be the hits which could significantly reduce prrsv-associated cpe with 50% inhibited concentrationic 50 values of 7.9 and 39.4 μmol/l respectively meanwhile compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol significantly decreased mrna expression of orf7 gene in a dose-dependent manner study results suggest that compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol may be useful anti-prrsv drugs for swine industry or the hits for further lead optimization
current hemagglutinin ha-based seasonal influenza vaccines induce vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that usually fail to provide protection against mismatched circulating viruses inclusion in the vaccine of highly conserved internal proteins such as the nucleoprotein np and the matrix protein 1 m1 was shown previously to increase vaccine efficacy by eliciting cross-reactive t-cells however appropriate delivery systems are required for efficient priming of t-cell responses in this study we demonstrated that administration of novel self-amplifying mrna sam 1 vectors expressing influenza np sam np m1 samm1 and np and m1 samm1-np delivered with lipid nanoparticles lnp induced robust polyfunctional cd4 t helper 1 cells while np-containing sam also induced cytotoxic cd8 t cells robust expansions of central memory t cm and effector memory t em cd4 and cd8 t cells were also measured an enhanced recruitment of npspecific cytotoxic cd8 t cells was observed in the lungs of samnp-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge finally we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of rna samm1-np and protein monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine miiv was feasible induced simultaneously np- m1-and ha-specific t cells and ha-specific neutralizing antibodies and enhanced miiv efficacy against a heterologous challenge in conclusion systemic administration of sam vectors expressing conserved internal influenza antigens induced protective immune responses in mice supporting the sam 1 platform as another promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines
background constant treatment regimens with toltrazuril against cystoisospora suis infection in piglets are being applied in the intensive production systems for the last two decades but the possibility of resistance development has not been addressed so far despite limited availability of treatment alternatives recently a pig producer in the netherlands who routinely used toltrazuril complained about diarrhea in suckling piglets in the absence of bacterial and viral pathogens and oocysts of c suis could be isolated from feces of affected litters methods piglets from two litters were infected with a field isolate of c suis holland-i and treated with 0 holl-ctrl 20 holl-20 or 30 holl-30 mg/kg of body weight bw of toltrazuril baycox®. the efficacy of toltrazuril was measured by assessment of oocyst excretion fecal consistency and bw gain a separate litter was infected with a toltrazurilsusceptible strain of c suis wien-i and treated with 0 wien-ctrl or 20 wien-20 mg/kg bw of toltrazuril for comparison results treatment with the recommended 20 mg/kg dose of toltrazuril completely suppressed oocyst shedding and diarrhea in group wien-20 the prevalence of oocyst excretion was 100% in the groups infected with holland-i and 80% in the group wien-ctrl most days with diarrhea were observed in group holl-20 with an average of 6.40% followed by 5.71% in wien-ctrl while in holl-ctrl and holl-30 diarrhea was only seen in 1.79% of the samples n = 14/piglet oocyst excretion fecal consistency and bw gain did not differ significantly among groups infected with holland-i indicating loss of efficacy to toltrazuril conclusion experimental infections and treatment confirmed toltrazuril resistance against the field isolate even at increased dosage such isolates are a potential threat to pig production as no other effective and economically sustainable alternative treatment is currently available in the absence of a standardized protocol for resistance testing in c suis regular parasitological examination and if possible experimental confirmation should be considered to evaluate the extent and consequences of toltrazuril resistance
bats are natural reservoirs of several important emerging viruses cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential therefore understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species here we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents another important host group we show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species we identify host traits associated with important reservoir species gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network we identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence
influenza a virus h1n1 which arose in 2009 constituted the fourth pandemic after the cases of 1918 1957 and 1968 this new variant was formed by a triple reassortment with genomic segments from swine avian and human influenza origins the objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin n=2038 and neuraminidase n=1273 genes in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains estimate if these genes evolved through positive negative or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs a continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential
disease-modifying treatments including immunosuppressive treatments have shown positive effects on the disease course but are associated with systemic consequences on the immune system and may increase the risk of infections and alter vaccine efficiency therefore vaccination of ms patients is of major interest over the last years vaccine hesitancy has steadily grown especially in western countries partly due to fear of sequelae arising from vaccination especially neurological disorders the interaction of vaccination and ms has been discussed for decades in this review we highlight the immunology of vaccination provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of ms vaccination and immunosuppression in conclusion there is consensus that ms cannot be caused by vaccines neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines however particular attention should be paid to two aspects first in immunocompromised patients live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated albeit in weakened form second protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment in conclusion there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen ms thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections therefore vaccination should be in general recommended to ms patients
infections with the herpes simplex virus hsv and the human cytomegalovirus hcmv can lead to lifethreatening diseases particularly in immunosuppressed patients furthermore hsv infections at birth herpes neonatorum can result in a disseminated disease associated with a fatal multiorgan failure congenital hcmv infections can result in miscarriage serious birth defects or developmental disabilities antibody-based interventions with hyperimmunoglobulins showed encouraging results in clinical studies but clearly need to be improved the isolation of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is a promising strategy to establish potent therapy options against hsv and hcmv infections monoclonal antibodies are commonly isolated from hybridomas or ebv-immortalized b-cell clones the screening procedure to identify virus-specific cells from a cell mixture is a challenging step since most of the highly neutralizing antibodies target complex conformational epitopes on the virus surface conventional assays such as elisa are based on purified viral proteins and inappropriate to display complex epitopes to overcome this obstacle we have established two full-virus based methods that allow screening for cells and antibodies targeting complex conformational epitopes on viral surface antigens the methods are suitable to detect surface antigen-specific cells from a cell mixture and may facilitate the isolation of highly neutralizing antibodies against hsv and hcmv
respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract mostly causing mild diseases however in vulnerable populations such as newborns infants the elderly and immune-compromised individuals these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract causing a more severe disease e g pneumonia respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes furthermore as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier some of these pathogens like influenza a and sars-cov have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality for a few decades now data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system cns viruses infecting human cns cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy including encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses respiratory viruses may damage the cns as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals virus-induced neuro-immunopathology and/or viral replication which directly causes damage to cns cells virus-induced neuropathology the etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood herein we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in cns infection with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome sfts caused by the sfts virus sftsv a phlebovirus in the family bunyaviridae is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease that impacts humans this disease manifests as a decreased blood cell count and multi-organ failure with a case-fatality rate of more than 12% in china because vaccines or antiviral drugs for the treatment of this disease are not available monitoring the sfts circulation in animals and controlling the tick-mammal cycle are important for preventing sfts monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of sftsv were generated to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay celisa for the detection of antibodies against sftsv infection in cattle the specificity and sensitivity of celisa was assessed by comparing the results of this assay to those of an immunofluorescence assay ifa the results of the celisa using 416 field bovine serum samples and laboratory-immunized positive sera showed 98.1% consistency with those of the ifa the celisa used in this study did not show cross-reactivity with antisera against other viral cattle diseases the celisa presented in this study can be applied to detect antibodies against sftsv in cattle
a b s t r a c t coronaviruses covs are positive-stranded rna viruses with potential as immunization vectors expressing high levels of heterologous genes and eliciting both secretory and systemic immune responses nevertheless its high recombination rate may result in the loss of the full-length foreign gene limiting their use as vectors transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev was engineered to express porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv small protein domains as a strategy to improve heterologous gene stability after serial passage in tissue cultures stable expression of small prrsv protein antigenic domains was achieved therefore size reduction of the heterologous genes inserted in cov-derived vectors led to the stable expression of antigenic domains immunization of piglets with these tgev vectors led to partial protection against a challenge with a virulent prrsv strain as immunized animals showed reduced clinical signs and lung damage further improvement of tgev-derived vectors will require the engineering of vectors with decreased recombination rate
virus vaccines have to be immunogenic sufficiently stable safe and suitable to induce long-lasting immunity to meet these requirements vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of i the protective roles of antiviral b and t-cell-mediated immune responses ii the complexity and plasticity of major viral antigens and iii virus molecular biology and pathogenesis there are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines whole-inactivated virus vectored and live-attenuated virus vaccines each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations while nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines in most cases the latter induce longlasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination the chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus cov vaccines focusing on two zoonotic covs the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome cov both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans the development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic covs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that for example interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types such as macrophages dendritic and epithelial cells and t lymphocytes thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination
indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa enables detection and quantification of antigenspecific antibodies in biological samples such as human or animal sera most current mers-cov serological assays such as neutralization immunofluorescence or protein microarray rely on handling of live mers-cov in high containment laboratories highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and reagents representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited in this chapter we describe a validated and optimized indirect elisa protocol based on recombinant s1 subunit amino acids 1-725 of mers-cov for qualitative and quantitative determination of mers-covbinding antibodies
equine arteritis virus eav is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis eva a respiratory systemic and reproductive disease of horses and other equid species following natural infection 10-70% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed eav in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life recently we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulations of cd3 + t lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro eav infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with longterm carrier status following exposure to the virus in contrast stallions not possessing the cd3 + t lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers a genome wide association study gwas using the illumina equine snp50 chip revealed that the ability of eav to infect cd3 +
canine parvovirus cpv is an important pathogen in domestic dogs and the original antigenic types cpv-2 and its variants cpv-2a 2b and 2c are prevalent worldwide a multiplex taqman real-time pcr method was developed for the detection and differentiation of four antigenic types of cpv a set of primers and probes cpv-305f/cpv-305r and cpv-2-305p for cpv-2/cpv-2a-305p for cpv-2a 2b and 2c was able to differentiate cpv-2 and its variants cpv-2a 2b and 2c another set of primers and probes cpv-426f/cpv-426r and cpv-2-426p for cpv-2 and 2a/cpv-2b-426p for cpv-2b/cpv-2c-426p for cpv-2c was able to differentiate cpv-2a 2 cpv-2b and cpv-2c with these primers and probes the multiplex taqman real-time pcr assay detected effectively and differentiated cpv-2 2a 2b and 2c by two separate real-time pcrs no cross reactivity was observed with canine distemper virus canine adenovirus and canine coronavirus the detection limit of the assay is 10 1 genome copies/μl for cpv-2 cpv-2a cpv-2b and 10 2 copies/μl for cpv-2c the multiplex realtime pcr has 100% agreement with dna sequencing we provide a sensitive assay that simultaneously detects and differentiate four antigenic types of cpv and the method was also used for quantification of cpvs viral genome
streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus s zooepidemicus has caused several outbreaks of haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs in recent years this highly contagious and often fatal disease is characterised by sudden onset of clinical signs including pyrexia dyspnoea and haemorrhagic nasal discharge post mortem examination typically reveals pulmonary haemorrhage and pleural effusion histopathology demonstrates fibrino-suppurative necrotising and haemorrhagic pneumonia in most cases the pathogenesis of s zooepidemicus infection in dogs is incompletely understood bacterial virulence factors as well as host factors may contribute to the severe outcome s zooepidemicus occasionally causes zoonotic infections with potentially serious consequences canine vaccines for s zooepidemicus are currently not available and prevention of the disease therefore relies on limiting bacterial spread by implementing stringent control measures in kennels further research particularly sequence analysis of canine strains is required to gain insights into epidemiology and pathogenesis of this emerging disease
in the anthropocene context changes in climate land use and biodiversity are considered among the most important anthropogenic factors affecting parasites-host interaction and wildlife zoonotic diseases emergence transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector usually a macroparasite and its reservoir host in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate the scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens specifically we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in europe tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev and west nile virus wnv in both cases variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a one-health framework

different species of camelids play an important role in the epidemiology of various emerging infectious diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome for precise investigations of the immunopathogenesis in these host species appropriate immunohistochemical markers are highly needed in order to phenotype distinct immune cells populations in camelids so far specific immunohistochemical markers for camelid immune cells are rarely commercially available and cross-reactivity studies are restricted to the use of frozen dromedary tissues to bridge this gap 14 commercially available primary antibodies were tested for their suitability to demonstrate immune cell populations on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded ffpe tissue sections of dromedaries bactrian camels llamas and alpacas in the present study out of these 9 antibodies directed against cd3 cd20 cd79␣ hla-dr iba-1 myeloid/histiocyte antigen cd204 cd208 and cd68 antigen exhibited distinct immunoreaction patterns to certain camelid immune cell subsets the distribution of these antigens was comparatively evaluated in different anatomical compartments of thymus spleen mesenteric and tracheobronchial lymph nodes the presented results will provide a basis for further investigations in camelids especially with respect to the role of the immune response in certain infectious diseases which harbor a considerable risk to spill over to other species
infectious bronchitis virus ibv the first coronavirus described was initially associated with severe respiratory disease however outbreaks have more recently also been associated with nephropathogenesis topographically interrelated antigenic determinants of the nephropathogenic gray strain of ibv were characterized using eleven monoclonal antibodies mabs four mabs igg 2a~c defined epitopes that were both conformation-independent and group specific reacting with gray arkansas ark and massachusetts41 mass41 strains seven mabs igg 1~ defined conformation-dependent epitopes that could differentiate the gray from the ark and mass strains the spike protein specificity of the mabs was determined with the conformation-independent mabs and one mab that reacted only in "non-denaturing" western blot assays competitive binding studies using these mabs suggested a high degree of functional dependency among the associated epitopes as might be expected with a protein of complex secondary and tertiary structure at least two regions associated with complete protection of infected embryos were identified that consisted of both conformation-dependent and independent epitopes however a "non-neutralizing" mab which did not protect the embryo from gross lesions did inhibit virus-induced lesions and replication in the kidneys these mabs should be valuable tools in studying ibv pathogenesis

swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov is a newly identified enteric alphacoronavirus that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets in china here we propagated a virulent strain sads-cov/cn/gdwt/ 2017 in vero cells for up to 83 passages four strains of sads-cov/gdwt-p7 -p18 -p48 and -p83 were isolated and characterized sequence alignments showed that these four novel strains exhibited 16 nucleotide mutations and resultant 10 amino acid substitutions in open reading frame 1a/1b spike ns3a envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins furthermore a 58-bp deletion in ns7a/7b was found in p48 and p83 strains which led to the loss of ns7b and 38 amino acid changes of ns7a pig infection studies showed that the p7 strain caused typical watery diarrhea while the p83 strain induced none-to-mild delayed and transient diarrhea this is the first report on cell adaption of a virulent sads-cov strain which gives information on the potential virulence determinants of sads-cov
interest in the potential of monoclonal antibodies mabs to serve as therapeutic agents has surged in the past decade with a major emphasis on human viral diseases there has been much attention in this area directed towards the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 hiv-1 and promising research developments have emerged on the inhibition of hiv-1 infection by mabs and the identification of several highly conserved neutralizing epitopes more recently potent fully-human neutralizing mabs have been developed against a variety of important human viral disease agents including the paramyxoviruses hendra virus and nipah virus and human or humanized mabs have been developed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and west nile virus among others most of these more recently developed antiviral mabs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies and the implementation of simplified inexpensive yet efficient methods for expressing and purifying the initially selected fragment antibodies is of prime importance in further facilitating this area of research
semen is known to be a route of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv transmission a method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated prrsv rna in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference rnas as endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription rt-pcr ube2d2 mrna was selected particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of prrsv rna ube2d2 mrna is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed n = 36 however the amount of ube2d2 mrna in porcine semen varied up to 106-fold thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of prrsv rna for quantitation a synthetic non-metazoan rna was added to the rna isolation reaction at an exact copy number the photosynthesis gene ribulose-15-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit rbcl from arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike unexpectedly prrsv rna was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free spf boars which were tested elisa-negative for anti-prrsv antibodies therefore rt-pcr for seminal cell-associated prrsv is a powerful tool for managing the spf status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations

a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is being intensively pursued against its re-emergence we generated a sars coronavirus sars-cov spike protein-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus rvv-s using highly attenuated strain lc16m8 intradermal administration of rvv-s into rabbits induced neutralizing nt antibodies against sars-cov 1 week after administration and the nt titer reached 11000 after boost immunization with rvv-s significantly nt antibodies against sars-cov were induced by administration of rvv-s to rabbits that had been pre-immunized with lc16m8 rvv-s can induce nt antibodies against sars-cov despite the presence of nt antibodies against vv these results suggest that rvv-s may be a powerful sars vaccine including in patients previously immunized with the smallpox vaccine
host shifts where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species are a major source of 17 emerging infectious diseases they frequently occur between related host species and often rely on 18 the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species to 19 investigate genetic changes in novel hosts we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an rna 20 virus drosophila c virus in 19 different species of drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral 21 genomes we found a strong pattern of parallel evolution where viral lineages from the same host 22were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species when we 23 compared viruses that had evolved in different host species we found that parallel genetic changes 24 were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related this suggests that when a 25 virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species this 26 may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species and may mean that when 27 a new pathogen appears in a given species closely related species may become vulnerable to the 28 new disease.29

apart from bat-sars-cov we have identified a novel group 1 coronavirus bat-cov hku2 in rhinolophus sinicus chinese horseshoe bats since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif rbm of sars-cov may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-sars-cov and bat-cov hku2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of r sinicus in hong kong and guangdong complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-cov hku2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome 27164 nucleotides and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome this spike protein sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its c-terminus also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the rbm of spike protein of sars-cov which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-sars-cov these suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-cov hku2 bat-sars-cov and sars-cov
the common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the callitrichidae family weighing between 350 and 400 g the marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding model for studying aging reproduction neuroscience toxicology and infectious disease with regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents they are exquisite nhp models for viral protozoan and bacterial agents as well as prions the marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and susceptibility to wild type nonadapted viruses
nipah virus niv is a bat-borne zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe respiratory distress and encephalitis upon spillover into humans nipah virus is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts including humans pigs ferrets dogs cats hamsters and at least 2 genera of bats little is known about the biology of niv in the bat reservoir in this study we evaluate the potential for the egyptian fruit bat efb rousettus aegyptiacus to serve as a model organism for studying niv in bats our data suggest that niv does not efficiently replicate in efbs in vivo furthermore we show a lack of seroconversion against niv glycoprotein and a lack of viral replication in primary and immortalized efb-derived cell lines our data show that despite using a conserved target for viral entry niv replication is limited in some bat species we conclude that efbs are not an appropriate organism to model niv infection or transmission in bats
containing 36 ppm germanium the present study was conducted to better understand the effects of gb on immune responses in a mouse model and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases in the mouse model dietary supplementation with gb enhanced concanavalin a cona-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of cd3+cd8+ t lymphocytes in pigs experimentally infected with prrsv viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the gb-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that gb-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with prrsv infection compared to the control group indicating that gb promotes prrsv clearance these antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of gb to increase cd3+cd8+ t lymphocyte production observed in the mice hence this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease keywords germanium biotite immune enhancement porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 136 bock-gie jung et al
the filoviruses ebola ebov and marburg marv cause fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates but are associated with subclinical infections in bats with rousettus aegyptiacus egyptian rousette/erb being a natural marv reservoir to understand the nature of this resistance we have analyzed the effects of filovirus infection on the transcriptomes of multiple erb tissues we have found that while the primary locus of infection was the liver transcriptomic changes occurred in multiple tissues suggesting systemic responses the transcriptional changes are indicative of inhibition of the complement system induction of vasodilation changes in coagulation modulation of iron regulation activation of a t cell response and converting macrophages from the m1 to m2 state we propose that these events are facets of a systemic anti-inflammatory state that enables effective control of the infection in bats and dissecting this state can inform how to control a filovirus infection in humans jayaprakash_bat_filovirus
to combat the possibility of a zoonotic h5n1 pandemic in a timely fashion it is necessary to develop a vaccine that would confer protection against homologous and heterologous human h5n1 influenza viruses using a replicating modified vaccinia virus tian tan strain mvtt as a vaccine vector we constructed mvtt ha-qh and mvtt ha-ah which expresses the h5 gene of a goose-derived qinghai strain a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived anhui strain a/anhui/1/ 2005 the immunogenicity profiles of both vaccine candidates were evaluated vaccination with mvtt ha-qh induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies nabs against a homologous strain and a wide range of h5n1 pseudoviruses clades 1 2.1 2.2 2.3.2 and 2.3.4 neutralization tests nt and haemagglutination inhibition hi antibodies inhibit the live autologous virus as well as a homologous a/xingjiang/1/2006 and a heterologous a/vietnam/1194/2004 representing two human isolates from clade 2.2 and clade 1 respectively importantly mice vaccinated with intranasal mvtt ha-qh were completely protected from challenge with lethal dosages of a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 and the a/viet nam/ 1194/2004 respectively but not control mice that received a mock mvtt s vaccine however mvtt ha-ah induced much lower levels of nt against its autologous strain our results suggest that it is feasible to use the h5 gene from a/bar-headed goose/qinghai/1/2005 to construct an effective vaccine when using mvtt as a vector to prevent infections against homologous and genetically divergent human h5n1 influenza viruses
background the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai virus h5n1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry in addition it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high 60% mortality rate effective vaccination against hpai h5n1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission in the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin sh5 3 produced in mammalian cells the secreted purified sh5 3 was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner it was shown to protect chickens in a dosedependent manner against a lethal challenge with h5n1 after a single vaccination protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative rt-pcr on rna isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs also in mice vaccination with sh5 3 provided complete protection against challenge with hpai h5n1 conclusions/significance our results demonstrate that sh5 3 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against hpai h5n1 as these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses citation cornelissen lahm de vries rp de boer-luijtze ea rigter a rottier pjm et al 2010 a single immunization with soluble recombinant trimeric hemagglutinin protects chickens against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 plos one 55 e10645
pseudorabies virus prv a member of the herpesviridae is the causative agent of an acute infectious disease in a variety of animals the emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains therefore the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies in this study we found that germacrone one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from rhizoma curcuma was able to effectively inhibit prv replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro germacrone showed antiviral activity against prv in the early phase of the viral replication cycle moreover we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus nor does it affect the expression of the prv receptor protein nectin-1 nectin-2 and cd155 our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant prv
with a global population of about 35 million in 47 countries dromedary camels play a crucial role in the economy of many marginal desert areas of the world where they survive under harsh conditions nonetheless there is scarce knowledge regarding camelsʼ parasite fauna which can reduce their milk and meat productions in addition only scattered information is available about zoonotic parasites transmitted to humans via contamination e g cryptosporidium spp giardia duodenalis balantidium coli blastocystis spp and enterocytozoon bieneusi as foodborne infections e g toxoplasma gondii trichinella spp and linguatula serrata or by arthropod vectors trypanosoma spp herein we draw attention of the scientific community and health policy-making organizations to the role camels play in the epidemiology of parasitic zoonotic diseases also in the view of an increase in their farming in desert areas worldwide

adjuvants potentiate antigen-specific protective immune responses and can be key elements promoting vaccine effectiveness we previously reported that the onchocerca volvulus recombinant protein rov-asp-1 can induce activation and maturation of naïve human dcs and therefore could be used as an innate adjuvant to promote balanced th1 and th2 responses to bystander vaccine antigens in mice with a few vaccine antigens it also promoted a th1-biased response based on pronounced induction of th1-associated igg2a and igg2b antibody responses and the upregulated production of th1 cytokines including il-2 ifn-c tnf-a and il-6 however because it is a protein the rov-asp-1 adjuvant may also induce anti-self-antibodies therefore it was important to verify that the host responses to self will not affect the adjuvanticity of rov-asp-1 when it is used in subsequent vaccinations with the same or different vaccine antigens in this study we have established rov-asp-1's adjuvanticity in mice during the course of two sequential vaccinations using two vaccine model systems the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov spike protein and a commercial influenza virus hemagglutinin ha vaccine comprised of three virus strains moreover the adjuvanticity of rov-asp-1 was retained with an efficacy similar to that obtained when it was used for a first vaccination even though a high level of anti-rov-asp-1 antibodies was present in the sera of mice before the administration of the second vaccine to further demonstrate its utility as an adjuvant for human use we also immunized non-human primates nhps with rbd plus rov-asp-1 and showed that rov-asp-1 could induce high titres of functional and protective anti-rbd antibody responses in nhps notably the rov-asp-1 adjuvant did not induce high titer antibodies against self in nhps thus the present study provided a sound scientific foundation for future strategies in the development of this novel protein adjuvant
six monoclonal antibodies raised against feline calicivirus fcv strain f9 were used in an enzyme-linked immuno-flow-assay elifa to analyse 55 isolates of fcv forty seven field isolates were obtained from cats with acute oral/respiratory disease chronic oral lesions and from cats showing vaccine reactions i e clinical signs of fcv infection shortly after vaccination eight reference strains including f9 and three vaccine strains based on f9 were also examined all of the strains of f9 derived from various sources reacted with all six of the monoclonal antibodies whereas some of the field isolates did not react with any in general the field isolates showed a spectrum of reactivities and selected isolates could be distinguished however there were no clear cut differences between the clinical groups overall the oral/respiratory group showed less reactivity with the monoclonals suggesting they were less related to f9 although the other groups appeared to be more closely related to f9 none of the isolates tested reacted with all six monoclonal antibodies
infections by clostridium perfringens type a are perhaps the most common causes of clostridial hemorrhagic enteritis in neonatal ruminants affected calves exhibit tympany hemorrhagic abomasitis and abomasal ulceration gram-positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood but probably include dietary issues perhaps relating to overfeeding feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum or conditions which effect decreased gut motility fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome the calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea and the abdomen became distended and painful in spite of intensive therapy the calf died 48 h after birth at necropsy the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic the proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous and microscopic examination revealed gram-positive rods in association with acute necrotizing hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation isolates of c perfringens from this calf were pcr positive for cpb2 the gene encoding beta2 toxin this finding is of unknown significance only 14.3% 8/56 of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive and only 50% of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express cpb2 the most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease elucidation of virulence attributes and development and application of prevention and control strategies r
human rhinoviruses hrv represent the single most important etiological agents of the common cold and are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory infections in humans currently the performance of available animal models for immunization studies using hrv challenge is very limited the cotton rat sigmodon hispidus is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections in this work we show that without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus intranasal infection of cotton rats with hrv16 resulted in measurable isolation of infective virus lower respiratory tract pathology mucus production and expression of interferon-activated genes intramuscular immunization with live hrv16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies in addition cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-hrv16 serum were protected against hrv16 intranasal challenge finally protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of infectious virus loads in the lung following intranasal challenge overall our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection
in this study we were interested in determining if high titered egg adapted modified live infectious bronchitis virus ibv vaccines contain spike gene related quasispecies that undergo selection in chickens following vaccination we sequenced the spike glycoprotein of 12 ibv vaccines 5 different serotypes from 3 different manufacturers directly from the vaccine vial then compared that sequence with reisolated viruses from vaccinated and contact-exposed birds over time we found differences in the s1 sequence within the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers differences in s1 sequence between different vaccine serials from the same manufacturer and intra-vaccine differences or quasispecies comparing the sequence data of the reisolated viruses with the original vaccine virus we were able to identify in vivo selection of viral subpopulations as well as mutations to our knowledge this is the first report showing selection of a more fit virus subpopulation as well as mutations associated with replication of modified live ibv vaccine viruses in chickens this information is important for our understanding of how attenuated virus vaccines including potential vaccines against the sars-cov can ensure long-term survival of the virus and can lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new viral pathogens this information is also valuable for the development of safer modified live coronavirus vaccines
background individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis we studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic uk cats using results of a real time pcr assay for 8 enteropathogenic species feline coronavirus co feline panleukopenia virus pa clostridium perfringens cl salmonella enterica sa giardia spp gi tritrichomonas foetus tr cryptosporidium spp cr and toxoplasma gondii to age gender breed and history were recorded pcr panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis results overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% co 22.1% pa 56.6% cl 0.8% sa 20.6% gi 18.8% tr 24.4% cr and 1.0% to prevalence of co gi and tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats dsh and prevalence decreased with increasing age for co pa gi cr and tr co-infection was common ≥2 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats and 13.3% of cats had ≥4 enteropathogens mean x enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 ±1.3 sd was significantly higher in pedigree cats x =2.51 compared to dsh x =1.68 and decreased with age x =2.64 <6 months x =1.68 for >1 yr more cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested 12.7% than expected when exact combinations of co-infection were examined tr tended to be found in combinations with co cl and gi conclusions multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats and case management needs to take this into account in contrast the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay
severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus sars-cov causes sars the pathogenic mechanisms of sars-cov remain poorly understood six cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with the hku39849 isolate of sars-cov via four routes after intranasal inoculation the virus was isolated from respiratory swabs on days 2-7 postinoculation p i and virus genome was detected in intestinal tissues on day 7 p i virus was not detected after intragastric inoculation after intravenous inoculation infectious virus was isolated from rectal swabs and virus antigen was detected in intestinal cells on day 14 p i after intratracheal i t inoculation virus antigen-positive alveolar cells and macrophages were found in lung and infectious virus was detected in lymphoid and intestinal tissues the peribronchial lymph nodes showed evidence of an immune response lung tissue and ⁄ or fluid and ⁄ or the peribronchial lymph node of the intratracheally inoculated animals had high tnf-a il-8 and il-12 levels sars lung lesions are only generated in monkeys by i t inoculation the virus appears to spread into and perhaps via the intestinal and lymphatic systems it has been suggested previously that viraemia may cause intestinal infections in sars patients
canine influenza virus civ subtype h3n2 is a newly identified highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes cough pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms in dogs data indicate that the virus is responsible for recent clinical cases of dog disease in china however therapeutic options for this disease are very limited in this study seven monoclonal antibodies mabs against civ js/10 an h3n2 subtype virus were produced and characterized among them mab d7 which is specific for the ha2 glycopeptide gp induced the highest neutralization titers the protection provided by mab d7 was evaluated in balb/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of h3n2 influenza virus including two strains of civ and one strain of swine influenza virus siv the data show that mab d7 protected the mice from infection with the three viral strains especially the homologous strain which was indicated by the recovery of body weight reduction of viral load and reduction of tissue damage moreover the levels of ifn-γ and tnf-α in the lungs as detected by elisa were reduced in the infected mice treated with the mab d7 compared with those without mab d7 treatment thus our findings demonstrate for the first time that a mab could reduce the release of ifn-γ and tnf-α associated with tissue damage by civ infection and that the mab might be of great therapeutic value for civ infection
background immunization with the spike protein s of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-coronavirus cov in mice is known to produce neutralizing antibodies and to prevent the infection caused by sars-cov polyethylenimine 25k pei is a cationic polymer which effectively delivers the plasmid dna results in the present study the immune responses of balb/c mice immunized via intranasal i n route with sars dna vaccine pci-s in a pei/pci-s complex form have been examined the size of the pei/pci-s nanoparticles appeared to be around 194.7 ± 99.3 nm and the expression of the s mrna and protein was confirmed in vitro the mice immunized with i n pei/pci-s nanoparticles produced significantly p < 0.05 higher s-specific igg1 in the sera and mucosal secretory iga in the lung wash than those in mice treated with pci-s alone compared to those in mice challenged with pci-s alone the number of b220 + cells found in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice was elevated co-stimulatory molecules cd80 and cd86 and class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules i-a d were increased on cd11c + dendritic cells in cervical lymph node from the mice after pei/pci-s vaccination the percentage of ifn-γ- tnf-α-and il-2-producing cells were higher in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice than in control mice conclusion these results showed that intranasal immunization with pei/pci-s nanoparticles induce antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses

understanding the determinants of adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 is critical for fighting the ongoing covid-19 pandemic here we assayed both antibody and t-cell reactivity to sars-cov-2 antigens in covid-19 convalescent patients and healthy donors sampled before and during the pandemic our results show that while anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies can distinguish convalescent patients from healthy donors the magnitude of t-cell response was more pronounced in healthy donors sampled during covid-19 pandemic than in donors sampled before the outbreak this hints at the possibility that some individuals have encountered the virus but were protected by t-cell cross-reactivity observed a public and diverse t-cell response was observed for two a*02-restricted sars-cov-2 epitopes revealing a set of t-cell receptor motifs displaying germline-encoded features bulk cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell response to sars-cov-2 glycoprotein s is characterized by multiple groups of homologous t-cell receptor sequences some of which are shared across multiple donors indicating the existence of immunodominant epitopes overall our findings indicate that t cells form an efficient response to sars-cov-2 and alongside the antibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying sars-cov-2 exposure and immunity we hope that data including the set of specific tcell receptors identified in this study can serve as a basis for future developments of sars-cov-2 vaccinations and monitoring

induced host immune response but the relative contribution of each remains largely unknown for example c57bl/6 b6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus jhm strain jhmv develop severe encephalitis with death occurring within 7 days here we show that the host response to a single jhmvspecific immunodominant cd4 t-cell epitope is critical for severe disease we engineered a recombinant jhmv with mutations in the immunodominant cd4 t-cell epitope rj m y135q . infection of naïve b6 mice with this virus resulted in mild disease with no mortality however introduction of a cd4 t-cell epitope from listeria monocytogenes into rj m y135q generated a highly virulent virus the decrease in disease severity was not due to a switch from th1 to th2 predominance in rj m y135q -infected mice an effect on cd8 t-cell function or differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-␣ by jhmv-specific cd4 t cells these results show that the response to a single virus-specific cd4 t-cell epitope may contribute to a pathogenic host response in the setting of acute viral disease and that abrogation of this response ameliorates clinical disease without diminishing virus clearance
we describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef pork and chicken purchased from stores in san francisco in beef we detected four previously reported viruses two parvoviruses belonging to different genera an anellovirus and one circovirus-like virus and one novel bovine polyomavirus species bpyv2-sf whose closest relatives infect primates detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect both ungulate species in pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three genera an anellovirus and pig circovirus 2 chicken meat contained numerous gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel gyrovirus species gyv7-sf our results provide an initial characterization of some of the viruses commonly found in us store-bought meats which included a diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular dna genomes whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing human sera for specific antibodies
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov causes severe respiratory infection and continues to infect humans thereby contributing to a high mortality rate 34.3% in 2019 in the absence of an available licensed vaccine and antiviral agent therapeutic human antibodies have been suggested as candidates for treatment in this study human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by sorting b cells from patient's pbmc cells with prefusion stabilized spike s probes and a direct immunoglobulin cloning strategy we identified six receptor-binding domain rbd-specific and five s1 non-rbd-specific antibodies among which only the rbd-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing potency ic 50 0.006-1.787 μg/ml as well as high affinity to rbd notably passive immunization using a highly potent antibody knih90-f1 at a relatively low dose 2 mg/kg completely protected transgenic mice expressing human dpp4 against mers-cov lethal challenge these results suggested that human monoclonal antibodies isolated by using the rationally designed prefusion mers-cov s probe could be considered potential candidates for the development of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antiviral agents for mers-cov human infection
in order to evaluate sheep as experimental model to test the efficacy of hobi-like pestivirus vaccines for cattle 10 sheep at different stages of pregnancy 30 or 50 days were experimentally infected with the italian prototype isolate italy-1/10-1 irrespective of the stage of pregnancy virus inoculation resulted in reproductive failures consisting of abortion stillbirths or birth of weak or persistently infected pi lambs aborted fetuses stillborn and dead lambs displayed extensive histopathological changes consisting of hemorrhages congestion and mononuclear infiltration in major organs pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys pi lambs were constantly viremic shed the virus through the nasal secretions and feces and in all cases but one did not have detectable hobi-like pestivirus antibodies before the assumption of colostrum the single seropositive infected lamb showed low-titer viremia and viral shedding that ceased only several weeks after the 3-month observation period the study proves that sheep are susceptible to the reproduction failures caused by hobi-like pestivirus infection and can serve as a suitable model for the evaluation of the fetal protection induced by homologous experimental vaccines
influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases endangering the health of humans especially young children and the elderly although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza frequent mutations in viral surface antigens low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines however no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the united states in this study we found that a novel adjuvant rov-asp-1 co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model rov-asp-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine allowing antigensparring by 10-fold the rov-asp-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum importantly rov-asp-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain these results demonstrate that rov-asp-1 is an effective adjuvant that 1 accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine 2 allows for antigen sparing and 3 augments a th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain

aynaud j m bernard s bottreau e lantier i salmon h and vannier ph 1991 induction of lactogenic immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine using an attenuated coronavirus mutant able to survive in the physicochemical environment of the digestive tract vet microbiol 26 227-239 a transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus mutant 188-sg selected as attenuated and resistant to acidity and proteases of the digestive tract of adult pigs was used as vaccine "nouzilly strain" in sows to protect suckling piglets against a challenge exposure carried out with a highly virulent tgev strain the pregnant sows were immunized once 42-49 days before farrowing or twice 42-49 and 7-15 days before farrowing by the oral intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-sg strain sows exposed to virulent tgev in the field and experimentally infected sows two oral inoculations during pregnancy were used as positive controls leading to high protection the neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk no protection against mortality was observed in the litters of 1 the nine seronegative susceptible sows with piglet mortality of 65/70 2 the seven once orally vaccinated sows with mortality of 44/54 3 the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route with mortality of 55/76 moderate protection was observed in 1 the eight sows vaccinated intramuscularly twice with piglet mortality of 36 / 90 2 the seven orally and intramuscularly vaccinated sows with piglet mortality of 31 / 51 in contrast improved protection was observed in 1 the 10 sows vaccinated twice orally with piglet mortality of 23/95 2 the four naturally infected sows with piglet mortality of 6/41 3 the six sows experimentally infected with virulent tgev with piglet mortality of 1/59 no correlation was found between neutralizing antibodies titers in serum and milk and protection rate of the piglets the results indicate that relative protective lactogenic immunity against tgev is induced only by repeated ingestion of the attenuated 188-sg strain of tgev
effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor viral spread and immune responses however little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-ncov is available we used the immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses including sars-cov which has high sequence similarity to 2019-ncov and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses we identified multiple specific regions in 2019-ncov that have high homology to sars virus parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential b and t cell epitopes for 2019-ncov the independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-ncov we identified potential targets for immune responses to 2019-ncov and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates
widespread geographic movement and extensive comingling of exhibition swine facilitates the spread and transmission of infectious pathogens nasal samples were collected from 2862 pigs at 102 exhibitions and tested for five pathogens at least one pathogen was molecularly detected in pigs at 63 61.8% exhibitions influenza a virus was most prevalent and was detected in 498 17.4% samples influenza d virus was detected in two 0.07% samples more than one pathogen was detected in 165 5.8% samples influenza a virus remains a top threat to animal and human health but other pathogens may be disseminated through the exhibition swine population
background oral immunization with vaccines may be an effective strategy for prevention of clostridium difficile infection cdi however application of previously developed vaccines for preventing cdi has been limited due to various reasons here we developed a recombinant lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a c difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for cdi prevention methods recombinant l lactis vaccine was developed using the ptrkh2 plasmid a high-copy-number escherichia coli-l shuttle vector 1 l lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 secreted-protein plasmid carrying the usp45 signal peptide spusp45 nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment c tetc and 14 of the 38 c-terminal repeats 14cdta of nontoxic c difficile toxin a tcda and 2 l lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant ptrkh2 membrane-anchored plasmid carrying spusp45 tetc 14cdta and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein m6 cwam6 then 32 male syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups n = 8 each for gavage of normal saline blank control and l lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector secreted-protein plasmid and membrane-anchored plasmid respectively after 1-week gavage of clindamycin the animals were administered with c difficile spore suspension general symptoms and intestinal pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy respectively protein levels of anti-tcda igg/iga antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by tcda treatment with or without anti-tcda serum pre-incubation or treatment apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry fl assay expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction pcr assay results after the c difficile challenge the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4 indicating that the cdi animal model was established in hamster of the 3 immunization groups secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities body weight decreases and pathological scores with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group p < 0.05 the tilter of igg antibody directed against tcda was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty plasmid group p < 0.05 while the corresponding titer of iga antibody directed against tcda had no substantial differences p > 0.05 the anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml tcda with the best protective effect achieved by anti-tcda serum pre-incubation the incidences of tcda-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-tcda serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group p < 0.05 mcp-1 icam-1 il-6 and gro-1 mrna expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups conclusion recombinant l lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing cdi in the hamster model thus providing an alternative for immunization of c difficile-associated diseases
at the population level the virus-host relationship is not set up to end with the complete elimination of either or both pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population in turn the virus can never completely eliminate the host population because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite a certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship against this backdrop viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart the answer seems clear the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population the dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively dramatically challenging host immunity and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population in this article we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which has caused covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virushost relationship in fact only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick recover and develop immunity while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover if the pandemic does not stop in a few decades it is anticipated that sars-cov-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population keywords sars-cov-2 · virus-host relationship system · pandemic publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
cystoisospora suis is a pathogen that causes diarrhea in pigs and can lead to serious disease species identification especially by histopathological examination is often difficult because of morphologically similar parasites such as eimeria species in this study we used histopathological bacteriological virological and parasitological methods to identify the cause of the disease in two piglets with severe diarrhea villous atrophy diffuse necrosis and flattening of mucosal epithelial cells were found in the ilea of examined piglets and coccidian parasites were found in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells in some merozoites in the meronts the presence of two nuclei indicated type 1 merozoites characteristic of c suis according to cystoisospora-specific pcr targeting the rrna internal transcribed spacer 1 its1 gene the sequences of the products were 98.5% similar to those of c suis escherichia coli o149 serogroup exhibiting a virulence factor profile lt stb and east1 as toxins and f4 as a colonization factor was detected in one piglet no other bacteria or significant enteric viruses were found co-infection with c suis and e coli could imply aggravation of the disease although further study is needed to assess the pathogenicity of this interaction this study is the first to clarify by molecular analysis the sequences of c suis detected in piglets in japan
studies of immunity in bat species are rare however it is important to determine immunological variations to identify factors influencing the health status of these endangered mammals from an evolutionary ecological conservation and public health point of view immunity is highly variable and can be influenced by both internal e g hormone levels energy demand and external factors e g pathogens climate as bats have some peculiar ecological energetic and putative immunological characteristics they are outstanding study organisms for ecoimmunological studies we tested if i female bats have a higher immunity than males similar to most other mammalian species and ii individuals differ according to their energy demand e g reproductive status to study these questions we sampled female and male myotis daubentonii with different reproductive states and estimated their bacterial killing activity hemolysis/hemagglutination titer immunoglobulin g igg concentration and total and differential white blood cell counts these methods characterize the cellular and humoral branches of both the adaptive and the innate immune responses of these individuals reproductively active males had lower cellular immunity compared to non-reproductive individuals pregnant females had increased igg concentrations while hemolysis was enhanced during lactation no clear trade-off between immunity and reproduction was found instead immunity of males and female bats seems to be modulated differently due to varying hormonal and energetic states our data suggest that both adaptive and innate immunity as well as individual differences i e sex and reproductive state need to be considered to get a comprehensive overall picture of immunity in wild mammals
rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by a calicivirus and is characterized by fulminant hepatitis with a fatality rate of more than 90% in adult rabbits it is not present in the united states it is spread by direct contact between rabbits by flies feeding on carcasses and experimentally by fleas and mosquitoes a single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective myxomatosis is a lethal generalized viral disease of rabbits it is endemic in wild rabbit populations and in sylvilagus spp it commonly occurs in the pacific states of the united states in warmer months the virus is spread passively on the mouthparts of mosquitoes and fleas outbreaks in farmed laboratory and pet rabbits result from spillover in wild rabbit populations a single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective rabbit fibroma virus is endemic in sylvilagus spp in north america it is spread by mosquitoes and causes a cutaneous fibroma at the inoculation site with no systemic signs of disease the fibroma generally regresses within 3 to 4 weeks of infection it is one of the most common causes of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits cottontail rabbit papillomavirus also known as shope papillomavirus is a cause of papillomas warts on nonhaired or thinly haired skin of rabbits in 66% to 80% of infected rabbits papillomas develop into carcinomas 8 to 14 months later the virus is spread from sylvilagus spp to rabbits by mosquitoes infection is uncommon rabbit oral papillomavirus occurs naturally in rabbits and is widespread among domestic rabbits in europe and the americas particularly young animals the papillomas are localized mostly on the underside of the tongue and usually regress spontaneously within a few weeks to a few months the multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits can be caused by bacteria viruses and parasites several different viruses have been isolated from rabbits with diarrhea such as rotavirus coronavirus and astrovirus whether natural outbreaks of enteritis can be caused by these viral agents alone or in conjunction with other pathogens eg clostridia spp escherichia coli and coccidia is not clear
a major limitation for better understanding the role of the human gut virome in health and disease is the lack of validated methods that allow high throughput virome analysis to overcome this we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation centrifugation filtration chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome containing nine highly diverse viruses and a bacterial mock-community containing four faecal bacterial species using quantitative pcr and next-generation sequencing this resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16s rrna genetic material in favour of viruses from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads furthermore our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes we propose netovir novel enrichment technique of viromes which allows for a fast reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies introducing minimal bias this procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads
the major histocompatibility complex mhc is one of the most diverse genetic regions under pathogen-driven selection because of its central role in antigen binding and immunity the highest mhc variability both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies has so far been found in passerine birds this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats if extraordinary high mhc variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species then similarly diverse mhc architectures should be found in bats bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens conspecifics and allospecifics we have characterized the mhc class i diversity in 116 panamanian seba's short-tailed bats carollia perspicillata a widely distributed generalist neotropical species we have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of mhc class i genes with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual this diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and in both taxonomic groups further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms our findings support the hypothesis that for species with a geographically broader range high mhc class i variability is particularly adaptive investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high mhc diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses
hepatitis c virus is considered a major public health problem infecting 2%-3% of the human population hepatitis c virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in fact hepatitis c virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available hepatitis c virus displays a narrow host species tropism naturally infecting only humans although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection to date there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis c virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic in fact due to this restricted host range a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis immune control and prophylactic vaccine development recently several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis c virus belonging to the hepaci-and pegivirus genera in small wild mammals rodents and bats and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans dogs and horses genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis c virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis c virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models in this review article we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis c virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis c virus finally we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen hcv is an enveloped positive-stranded rna virus belonging to the genus hepacivirus in the family of flaviviridae a second species
malaria is a disease induced by parasites of the plasmodium genus which are transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes and represents a great socio-economic burden worldwide plasmodium vivax is the second species of malaria worldwide but it is the most prevalent in latin america and other regions of the planet it is currently considered that vaccines represent a costeffective strategy for controlling transmissible diseases and could complement other malaria control measures however the chemical and immunological complexity of the parasite has hindered development of effective vaccines recent availability of several genomes of plasmodium species as well as bioinformatics tools are allowing the selection of large numbers of proteins and analysis of their immune potential herein we review recently developed strategies for discovery of novel antigens with potential for malaria vaccine development
an old world fruit bat pteropus giganteus held in captivity and suffering from necrosis of its wing digits failed to respond to antibiotic therapy and succumbed to the infection samples submitted to the national centre for foreign animal disease were tested for viral infection vero e6 cells exhibited minor but unique cytopathic effects on second blind passage and full cpe by passage four utilizing an unbiased random amplification technique from cell culture supernatant we identified a bacterium belonging to the bradyrhizobiaceae purification of cell culture supernatant on ty media revealed a slow growing bacterial isolate in this study using electron microscopy 16s rrna gene analysis and whole genome sequencing we identify a novel bacterial species associated with the site of infection belonging to the genus afipia this genus of bacteria is very diverse with only a limited number of species characterized afipia felis previously described as the etiological agent to cause cat scratch disease and afipia septicemium most recently shown to cause disease in humans highlight the potential for members of this genus to form a branch of opportunistic pathogens within the bradyrhizobiaceae increased utilization of next generation sequencing and genomics will aid in classifying additional members of this intriguing bacterial genera
emerging diseases are a major challenge to public health revealing the evolutionary processes that allow novel pathogens to adapt to new hosts also the potential barriers to host adaptation is central to understanding the drivers of disease emergence in particular it is unclear how the genetics and ecology of pathogens interact to shape the likelihood of successful cross-species transmission to better understand the determinants of host adaptation and emergence we modelled key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics at both intra-and inter-host scales using parameter values similar to those observed in influenza virus we considered the possibility of acquiring the necessary host adaptive mutations both before 'off-the-shelf' emergence and after 'tailor-made' emergence a virus is transmitted from a donor to a new recipient species under both scenarios population bottlenecks at interhost transmission act as a major barrier to host adaptation greatly limiting the number of adaptive mutations that are able to cross the species barrier in addition virus emergence is hindered if the fitness valley between the donor and recipient hosts is either too steep or too shallow overall our results reveal where in evolutionary parameter space a virus could adapt to and become transmissible in a new species
infectious bursal disease ibd continues to pose potential threat to poultry industry all over the world the disease can spell disaster not only through its infection but also by break of immunity in chickens vaccinated for other diseases l-arginine a ubiquitous semi-essential amino acid has emerged as an imunostimulant from variety of human and animal studies in the present study we demonstrate the stimulatory effects of l-arginine on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte iiels functions as well as on systemic immune response in chickens orally vaccinated with live intermediate plus ip strain of ibd vaccine challenge studies with virulent ibdv revealed complete 100% protection in ip + l-arginine group compared with 80% protection recorded in ip strain vaccinated chickens functional activities of iiels evaluated by cytotoxicity assay demonstrated significantly high percentage cytotoxicity in ip + l-arginine groups compared with ip group p < 0.05 proliferative response of iiels against ibdv antigen and con-a was also significantly higher in ip + l-arginine group similar results were obtained with peripheral blood mononuclear cell blastogenic response to ibdv and con-a analyzed as an indicator of systemic cell-mediated immune response orally administered ip strain vaccine elicited good antibody titres in both the groups ip and ip + l-arginine however the antibody titres were significantly higher in ip + l-arginine group compared with ip vaccinated group p < 0.05 these results clearly demonstrate that l-arginine stimulates intestinal and systemic immune response against ibdv
to study the effects of concurrent infection of cryptosporidium parvum with rotavirus and coronavirus in comparison to single infection of rotavirus and coronavirus electrocardiographic parameters and serum electrolytes and microelements are compared between eight calves with concurrent infection and ten calves with single infection calves with single infections had higher serum concentrations of sodium and calcium and less potassium copper and iron which was not statistically significant they also had significantly shorter p and qrs wave amplitudes and longer t wave duration in electrocardiogram patterns
background canine parvovirus cpv in dogs has been documented in many countries however evidence of the infection is scanty in ghana this study was conducted to detect canine parvovirus antigen in dogs presented with diarrhoea to the government veterinary clinic in kumasi ghana materials and methods faecal samples from 72 dogs presented with diarrhoea were tested for the presence of canine parvovirus antigen using commercially available rapid test kit bit® rapid colour canine parvovirus ag test kit bioindist co ltd korea based on the principle of immunochromatography influence of breed sex age vaccination history and the nature of diarrhoea were assessed data obtained was analysed with spss and subjected to the chi-square test significance was at α 0.05 results we found 61.11% tested positive 44/72 for cpv based on sex 61.54% of males 20/33 and 60.61% of females tested positive 24/39 a total of 65.67% of samples from puppies below 6 months were positive 56.25% of cpv vaccinated dogs and 70.83% of unvaccinated dogs were positive respectively 69.05% of samples from haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs and 50.00% from non-haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs were positive of cpv the study is the first documented evidence of the existence of cpv in ghana it also revealed that absence of bloody diarrhoea does not necessarily rule out cpv infection

the present study was designed for the detection of the most prevalent respiratory infections in chicken flocks and clarifying their interaction and impact on flock health a total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of newcastle disease virus ndv infectious bronchitis virus ibv influenza type a mycoplasma gallisepticum mg and mycoplasma synoviae ms molecular prevalence of ndv ibv low pathogenic avian influenza virus lpaiv h9n2 mg and ms was carried out on swab and tissue samples collected from 55 backyard flocks and 11 commercial broiler flocks suffered from respiratory infections using polymerase chain reaction pcr and reverse transcription-pcr results seroprevalence of ndv ibv influenza type a virus mg and ms in chicken backyard flocks was 56.4% 50.9% 12.7% 14.5% and 3.6% respectively specific antibodies against one or more respiratory viruses and mycoplasma were detected in 36.4% of backyard flocks indicating concurrent viral infections the molecular survey showed that 90.9% of chicken backyard flocks were infected with common respiratory viruses ndv ibv and lpaiv h9n2 while 81.8% of commercial broiler flocks were infected the molecular prevalence rate of ndv ibv and lpaiv h9n2 was 46.97% 56.1% and 19.7% in backyard flocks respectively combined viral and bacterial infection represented 40% and 63.6% of the respiratory infections resulting in enhanced pathogenicity and increased mortalities of up to 87.5% and 27.8% in backyard and commercial flocks respectively mixed infection of ibv lpaiv h9n2 and/or escherichia coli is the most prevalent mixed infection in broiler flocks inducing severe clinical outcomes avian pathogenic e coli was respectively isolated from 40% of backyard flocks and 81.82% of broiler flocks staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three backyard chicken flocks mixed with other respiratory pathogens with elevated mortality mixed infection of e coli and mg reported in 9.1% of broiler flock mg was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks while ms was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with e coli and other viruses our results confirm that mixed infections are more commonly prevalent and associated with dramatic exacerbation in clinical outcomes than a single infection bidirectional synergistic interaction between these concurrently interacted respiratory pathogens explains the severe clinical impact and high mortality rate the high prevalence of ibv either as a single or combined infection with lpaiv h9n2 and/or e coli in spite of intensive use of commercial vaccines increases the need for revising vaccination programs and the application of standard biosecurity measures backyard chickens impose a great risk and threaten commercial flocks due to the high prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens
although not widely studied behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction r o of the pathogen the most notable example is rabies when a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression the virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated toxoplasmosis is another example when mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats thus increasing their chances of being eaten toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans e g through cat feces has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period thus producing an obvious vector for transmission here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus sars-cov2 which produces the covid-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans
conventional influenza vaccines need to be designed and manufactured yearly however they occasionally provide poor protection owing to antigenic mismatch hence there is an urgent need to develop universal vaccines against influenza virus using nucleoprotein np and extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 m2e genes from the influenza a virus a/beijing/30/95 h3n2 we constructed four recombinant vaccinia virus-based influenza vaccines carrying np fused with one or four copies of m2e genes in different orders the recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to immunize balb/c mice humoral and cellular responses were measured and then the immunized mice were challenged with the influenza a virus a/puerto rico/8/34 pr8 np-specific humoral response was elicited in mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying full-length np while robust m2e-specific humoral response was elicited only in the mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying multiple copies of m2e all recombinant viruses elicited np-and m2e-specific cellular immune responses in mice only immunization with rvj-4m2enp induced remarkably higher levels of il-2 and il-10 cytokines specific to m2e furthermore rvj-4m2enp immunization provided the highest cross-protection in mice challenged with 20 mld 50 of pr8 therefore the cross-protection potentially correlates with both np and m2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by rvj-4m2enp which expresses a fusion antigen of full-length np preceded by four m2e repeats these results suggest that the rational fusion of np and multiple m2e antigens is critical toward inducing protective immune responses and the 4m2enp fusion antigen may be employed to develop a universal influenza vaccine
background the only natural hosts of pseudorabies virus prv are members of the family suidae sus scrofa scrofa in species other than suids infection is normally fatal in these mammals including carnivores prv typically causes serious neurologic disease the endangered iberian lynx lynx pardinus is a wild feline endemic to southwestern europe iberian peninsula the iberian lynx was found to be the world's most endangered felid species in 2002 in wild felines prv infection has only been previously reported once in a florida panther in 1994 no seropositive lynxes have ever been found nor has prv been detected in dead iberian lynxes to date case presentation we describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an iberian lynx lynx pardinus pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild iberian lynx from extremadura sw spain by histopathological examination immunohistochemistry polymerase chain reaction pcr and sequence analysis gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine pseudorabies virus prv antigen was found in neuronal and nonneuronal cells of the brain tonsils and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis the presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested pcr the sequence analysis of the 146 bp fragment from the viral glycoprotein b gene showed that the amplified sequence matched with 100% identity the prv genome furthermore specific dna from glycoprotein d and e encoding-genes was detected by conventional and real-time pcr respectively confirming the latter that this infection was produced by a wild-type prv strain conclusions this study supports the suspicion that prv could infect the iberian lynx the detection of prv in a dead iberian lynx suggests that the virus may have a negative impact on the survival of endangered lynxes in the wild however because this is the first verified instance of lynx mortality resulting from pseudorabies its true impact on the population is unknown
vaccine development has had a huge impact on human health however there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential this review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers -1 the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines and 2 the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases that will allow for translation nanoparticle-based vaccines including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development these include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells enable cross-protection against divergent strains act as adjuvants or immunomodulators allow for sustained release of antigen enable single dose delivery and potentially obviate the cold chain while mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic an overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections with advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed taken together advances in nanotechnology combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections
development of necrotizing enterocolitis nec requires a susceptible host typically a premature infant or an infant with congenital heart disease enteral feedings and bacterial colonization although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of nec the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive unlike established normal adult gut microbiota which is quite complex uniform and stable early postnatal bacterial populations are simple diverse and fluid these properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of nec a broad variety of bacterial viral and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental nec frequently however the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals clustered outbreaks of nec in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest but do not prove a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease studies in cronobacter sakazakii the best characterized nec pathogen have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole but rather a characteristic of certain strains which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic the fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in nec progress in understanding the infectious nature of nec may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models
specified pathogen-free cats were naturally infected with fcov or experimentally infected with fcov type i seroconversion was determined and the course of infection was monitored by measuring the fcov loads in faeces whole blood plasma and/or monocytes tissue samples collected at necropsy were examined for viral load and histopathological changes experimentally infected animals started shedding virus as soon as 2 days after infection they generally displayed the highest viral loads in colon ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes seroconversion occurred 3-4 weeks post infection naturally infected cats were positive for fcov antibodies and monocyteassociated fcov viraemia prior to death at necropsy most animals tested positive for viral shedding and fcov rna was found in spleen mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow both experimentally and naturally infected cats remained clinically healthy pathological findings were restricted to generalized lymphatic hyperplasia these findings demonstrate the presence of systemic fcov infection with high viral loads in the absence of clinical and pathological signs
thanks to their strong immunostimulating properties and safety for humans plant viruses represent an appropriate basis for the design of novel vaccines the coat protein of alternanthera mosaic virus can form virus-like particles that are stable under physiological conditions and have adjuvant properties this work presents a recombinant human rotavirus a antigen based on the epitope of rotavirus structural protein vp6 using alternanthera mosaic virus coat protein as a carrier an expression vector containing the gene of alternanthera mosaic virus mu strain coat protein fused to the epitope of rotavirus protein vp6 was designed immunoblot analysis showed that the chimeric protein was effectively recognized by commercial polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus and therefore is a suitable candidate for development of a vaccine prototype interaction of the chimeric recombinant protein with the native coat protein of alternanthera mosaic virus and its rna resulted in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes that were recognized by antirotavirus antibodies
the hamadryas baboon papio hamadryas hamadryas is the only indigenous species of nonhuman primates nhp found in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa there are no peerreviewed publications on viral infections of the baboons of ksa apart from camels other animals are likely sources of the novel middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov for humans we investigated evidence of highly pathogenic coronavirus infections including merscov in a large group of commensal baboons accompanied by feral dogs on the outskirts of ta'if city ksa in february 2013 fifty baboons 16 juveniles and 34 adults were screened for serum antibodies to human coronaviruses hcov-043/-nl63/-229 and canine coronaviruses ccov-1-3 using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa technique and for merscov antibodies using serum neutralization test snt of the 50 sampled baboons 22% n = 11 were seropositive to hcovs 10% n = 5 were seropositive to ccovs while none had detectable merscov antibodies these findings bear potentially significant implications for public health canine health and baboon conservation efforts necessitating follow-up investigations and preventive measures at locations where baboons frequent human habitations or are regarded as tourist attractions in ksa
rino rappuoli is a graduate of siena university where he also earned his phd before moving to the sclavo research center the italian vaccine institute also in siena he then spent two years in the usa mostly at harvard with john murphy and alwin pappenheimer working on a new diphtheria vaccine based on a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin which has since become the basis for conjugate vaccines against haemophilus meningococcus and pneumococcal infections before returning to the sclavo research center where he developed an acellular vaccine based on a mutant pertussis toxin with many achievements in vaccine development to his credit he is now global head of vaccines research and development for novartis vaccines in siena and has most recently pioneered reverse vaccinology in which the genome of the pathogen is screened for candidate antigenic and immunogenic vaccine components we spoke to him about the potential for outbreaks of the kind we are now seeing with ebolavirus in west africa and what can be done to prevent them
background infectious diarrhea can be caused by bacteria viruses or protozoan organisms or a combination of these the identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established the objective of this study was to use a real-time pcr diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea as well the frequency in different countries feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus canine coronavirus canine parvovirus type 2 cpv-2 clostridium perfringens alpha toxin cpa cryptosporidium spp giardia spp and salmonella spp using molecular techniques results in total 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study overall 71/104 68.3% dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen a single infection in 39/71 dogs 54.9% and co-infections in 32/71 dogs 45.1% including 21/32 dogs 65.6% with dual 5/32 15.6% with triple and 6/32 18.8% with quadruple infections in the control group 13/43 30.2% dogs were positive all with single infections only the most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were cpa 40/104 dogs 38.5% cpv-2 36/104 dogs 34.6% and giardia spp 14/104 dogs 13.5%. cpv-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections associated with cpa cryptosporidium spp or giardia spp no statistical difference p = 0.8374 was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths p = 0.5722 in the presence or absence of single or co-infections conclusions diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections therefore multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors
three hundred sera were collected from horses in various parts of mongolia in 2007 and seroepidemiological surveys for several equine viruses performed on them equid herpesvirus 1 and equine rhinitis a virus were prevalent and equine arteritis virus and equid herpesvirus 3 were detected over a wide area though their rates of antibody-positivity were not high equine infectious anemia was distributed locally the rates of horses antibody-positive for japanese encephalitis virus and equine influenza virus were low but these were detected bovine coronavirus antibodies were detected at a high rate but it was not clear whether they were due to horse coronavirus
background more than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 have been confirmed while pcr-based assays are used for diagnosis high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion potential plasma donors and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen a luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from covid-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of sars-cov-2 findings fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric sars-cov-2 s protein ectodomain or its central portion the receptor binding domain rbd coated beads were incubated with sera followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total ig antibodies and phycoerythrin pe-labeled streptavidin readout using a luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subjects delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects interpretation antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with sars-cov-2 and have seroconverted as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered the use of the luminex binding ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours uses very little antigen and permits a high through-put of samples/day amanat f nguyen t chromikova v et al a serological assay to detect sars-cov-2 seroconversion in humans medrxid 2020

passive therapy with neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies mabs could be an effective therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov utilizing the human immunoglobulin transgenic mouse xenomouse® we produced fully human sars-cov spike s protein specific antibodies antibodies were examined for reactivity against a recombinant s1 protein to which 200 antibodies reacted twenty-seven antibodies neutralized 200tcid 50 sars-cov urbani additionally 57 neutralizing antibodies were found that are likely specific to s2 mapping of the binding region was achieved with several s1 recombinant proteins most s1 reactive neutralizing mabs bound to the rbd aa 318-510 however two s1 specific mabs reacted with a domain upstream of the rbd between aa 12 and 261 immunoglobulin gene sequence analyses suggested at least 8 different binding specificities unique human mabs could be used as a cocktail that would simultaneously target several neutralizing epitopes and prevent emergence of escape mutants
a simple and rapid immunochromatographic assay ica to detect satsuma dwarf virus sdv was developed using colloidal gold conjugates of anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies of six homogenization buffers tested 0.1 m citrate buffer ph 7.0 gave the best results for the ica in the ica addition of 0.1% thioglycolic acid in the homogenization buffers that have been widely used in enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa was deleterious to the reaction because of undesirable coagulation of the colloidal gold ica using the anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies was 8 times and 16 times more sensitive than double antibody sandwich-elisa and ica using the anti-sdv polyclonal antibody respectively the analysis is complete in only 15 min furthermore ica using the anti-sdv monoclonal antibodies could also detect sdv-related viruses
ebola virus ebov is a significant human pathogen that presents a public health concern as an emerging/re-emerging virus and as a potential biological weapon substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against ebov among these prospects a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is particularly robust as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment a concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent vsv vectors that express ebov glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with hiv this is especially important as all ebov outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of central and western africa with high hiv incidence rates in the population in order to address this concern we evaluated the safety of the recombinant vsv vector expressing the zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein vsvdg/zebovgp in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus shiv all six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the vsvdg/ zebovgp vaccine suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations while one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy the vaccine protected 4 of 6 shiv-infected macaques from death following zebov challenge evaluation of cd4+ t cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal zebov challenge had the lowest cd4+ counts suggesting that cd4+ t cells may play a role in mediating protection against zebov
background since rotavirus is one of the leading pathogens that cause severe gastroenteritis and represents a serious threat to human and animal health researchers have been searching for cheap safe and effective anti-rotaviral drugs there is a widespread of interest in using natural products as antiviral agents and among them licorice derived from glycyrrhiza spp has exerted antiviral properties against several viruses in this study anti-rotaviral efficacy of glycyrrhiza uralensis extract gue as an effective and cheaper remedy without side-effects was evaluated in colostrums-deprived piglets after induction of rotavirus diarrhea methods colostrums-deprived piglets were inoculated with porcine rotavirus k85 g5p strain on the onset of diarrhea piglets were treated with different concentration of gue to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of gue fecal consistency score fecal virus shedding and histological changes of the small intestine mrna expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines il8 il10 ifn-β ifn-γ and tnf-α signaling molecules p38 and jnk and transcription factor nfκb in the small intestine and spleen were determined results among the dosages 100-400 mg/ml administrated to animals 400 mg/ml of gue cured diarrhea and markedly improved small intestinal lesion score and fecal virus shedding mrna expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines il8 il10 ifn-β ifn-γ and tnf-α signaling molecules p38 and jnk and transcription factor nfκb in the small intestine and spleen were markedly increased in animals with rva-induced diarrhea but dose-dependently decreased in gue treated animals after rva-induced diarrhea conclusions gue cures rotaviral enteritis by coordinating antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects therapy of this herbal medicine can be a viable medication for curing rotaviral enteritis in animals and humans
the role played by bats as a potential source of transmission of leptospira spp to humans is poorly understood despite various pathogenic leptospira spp being identified in these mammals here we investigated the prevalence and diversity of pathogenic leptospira spp that infect the straw-colored fruit bat eidolon helvum we captured this bat species which is widely distributed in africa in zambia during 2008-2013 we detected the flagellin b gene flab from pathogenic leptospira spp in kidney samples from 79 of 529 e helvum 14.9% bats phylogenetic analysis of 70 flab fragments amplified from e helvum samples and previously reported sequences revealed that 12 of the fragments grouped with leptospira borgpetersenii and leptospira kirschneri however the remaining 58 flab fragments appeared not to be associated with any reported species additionally the 16s ribosomal rna gene rrs amplified from 27 randomly chosen flab-positive samples was compared with previously reported sequences including bat-derived leptospira spp all 27 rrs fragments clustered into a pathogenic group eight fragments were located in unique branches the other 19 fragments were closely related to leptospira spp detected in bats these results show that rrs sequences in bats are genetically related to each other without regional variation suggesting that leptospira are evolutionarily well-adapted to bats and have uniquely evolved in the bat population our study indicates that pathogenic leptospira spp in e helvum in zambia have unique genotypes
the conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide this issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout north america so called 'colony collapse disorder' yet we still have little understanding of the causes of bee declines wild bumble bees bombus spp have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops is a possible cause we constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and using laboratory experiments and the literature estimated parameter values for the spillover of crithidia bombi a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial bombus we also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover and compared the fit of our model to patterns of c bombi infection observed in the field our model predicts that during the first three months of spillover transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse however a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly infecting up to 35-100% of wild bombus and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk in the field although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection the prevalences of c bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model indeed we found that spillover has allowed c bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses given the available evidence it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild bombus in north america improved management of domestic bees for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover
the present report describes outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal cross bred cattle calves ageing 1-2 months in an organized dairy farm the protozoan infection was confirmed by identifying bright red oocysts of cryptosporidium spp in the faecal samples after staining with modified acid fast zeihl-neelsen stain metronidazole and furazolidone combination was able to induce clinically and parasitological recovery this is believed to be the first report on the successful use of this drug combination against cryptosporidiosis
non-vaccine streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes are increasingly associated with disease we evaluated isolates of the same sequence type st199 but different serotype 15b/c 19a for growth in vitro and pathogenic potential in a chinchilla otitis media model we also developed a qpcr assay to quantitatively assess each isolate circumventing the need for selectable markers in vitro studies showed faster growth of serotype 19a over 15b/c both were equally capable of colonization and middle ear infection in this model serotype 19a is included in new conjugate vaccine formulations while serotype 15b/c is not non-capsular vaccine targets will be important in disease prevention efforts
leishmune ® is the industrialized version of the fml-saponin vaccine which has been shown to develop 92-95% protection in vaccinated dogs and 76-80% vaccine efficacy against field canine visceral leishmaniasis cvl in brazil leishmune ® has been proven to be safe and tolerable and a transmission-blocking vaccine which renders vaccinated dogs non-infectious to sand fly vectors in the present investigation 550 healthy seronegative dogs of endemic and epidemic areas of brazil were monitored for leishmune ®induced immunogenicity during a 2-year trial another group of 588 untreated exposed dogs was also studied in parallel both groups were seronegative on day 0 the strong immunogenicity induced by leishmune ® vaccine was demonstrated by the 98% of fml-seroconversion increase in absorbencies the 82.7% dth positive reactions and increase in skin test size diameters the average increase in cd8+ total lymphocytes population in blood 27.1% expected for qs21 saponin-containing vaccine the sustained proportions of cd4+ t cells and the average increased proportions of cd21+ b lymphocytes 42.3%. the leishmune ® -induced protection against cvl is demonstrated by the results 98.8% asymptomatic dogs at the end of first year and 99% healthy survivors at the end of the second year among vaccinated dogs compared to the 79.4% asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs p < 0.001 monitored in the untreated exposed cohort in spite of the low vaccine coverage it was possible to detect a 66.1% p < 0.005 reduction in belo horizonte and an 80.2% p < 0.005 reduction in araç atuba of the incidence of cvl among vaccinated dogs when compared to the global incidence of cvl of each town respectively our preliminary results support the potential use of leishmune ® to prevent cvl epidemics
bridger j c woode g n and meyling a 1978 isolation of coronaviruses from neonatal calf diarrhoea in great britain and denmark vet mierobiol 3 101--113 coronaviruses were isolated from neonatal calves with diarrhoea in great britain and denmark they were serially passed in gnotobiotic calves which developed acute diarrhoea pathological lesions were found in the small and large intestines coronaviruses were demonstrated by electron microscopic examination of the faeces and intestinal contents immunofluorescent staining of sections of small and large intestine and by isolation in tracheal organ cultures in early passages of the british coronavirus particles of about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the faeces by electron microscopy these particles were removed from the coronavirus preparations by cross-protection experiments in calves the coronaviruses were morphologically and antigenically similar to the bovine coronavirus isolated in the united states and the british virus was adapted to replicate in calf kidney cell cultures
hepatitis e virus hev and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv and are both globally prevalent in the pig population while hev does not cause clinical disease in pigs its zoonotic potential has raised concerns in the food safety sector prrs has become endemic in the united kingdom uk since its introduction in 1991 and continues to cause considerable economic losses to the swine industry a better understanding of the current prevalence and diversity of prrsv and hev in the uk and their potential association is needed to assess risks and target control measures appropriately this study used plasma tonsil and cecal content samples previously collected from pigs in 14 abattoirs in england and northern ireland to study the prevalence of several pathogens including prrsv and hev the diversity of prrsv strains detected in these samples was analyzed by sequencing open reading frame 5 orf5 revealing no substantial difference in prrsv strains from these clinically unaffected pigs relative to those from clinical cases of disease in the uk despite the potential immuno-modulatory effect of prrsv infection previously demonstrated to affect salmonella and hev shedding profiles no significant association was found between positive prrsv status and positive hev status
background pre-weaning diarrhea pwd is a syndrome affecting farm-raised neonatal mink kits apart from diarrhea it causes greasy skin exudation dehydration and distressed behavior and can ultimately lead to death no specific causative agents have been identified and the syndrome is regarded as multifactorial the aim of the present study was to investigate a possible inflammatory state in mink kits with pwd as indicated by raised serum concentrations of the acute phase protein serum amyloid a saa and by changes in intestinal pathomorphology and intestinal contents of bacteria samples collected from 20 diarrheic mink kits with pwd and 20 age-matched non-diarrheic control mink kits from two commercial danish farms during the pre-weaning period april-may in 2016 were analyzed concentrations of saa in serum samples from mink kits with pwd were significantly higher up to 1000fold compared to non-diarrheic control mink kits significant features of enterocytic vacuolization atrophy and fusion of villi in jejunum and mucosal atrophy of the colon of kits with pwd were found moreover attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes was more often found in kits suffering from pwd while intra-cytoplasmic eosinophil bodies were more frequently observed in control kits cellular infiltrations with mononuclear and neutrophil leukocytes were not associated with disease status bacteria from the staphylococcus intermedius group such as staphylococcus delphini were more frequently cultivated from control mink kits whereas enterococcus spp dominated in mink kits with pwd escherichia coli was cultivated from both control and mink kits with pwd but with a higher frequency from mink kits with pwd conclusion a significant increase in circulating concentrations of saa was found in pwd affected mink kits from 6 to 23 days old compared to controls the histopathological changes in pwd mink kits suggest that the type of diarrhea is secretory attachment of coccoid bacteria therefore might be responsible for an enterotoxic effect causing a loss of balance in movements of ions and water leading to the vacuolization and swelling of the enterocytes the slight to moderate infiltrations of neutrophils irrespectively of diarrheic status and the attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes are comparable to observations found in piglets suffering from new neonatal porcine diarrhea © the authors 2018 this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license http//creat iveco mmons .org/licen ses/by/4.0/ which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made the creative commons public domain dedication waiver
the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov it spread rapidly to many countries and developing a sars vaccine is now urgently required in order to study the immunogenicity of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov virion as a vaccine candidate we subcutaneously immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov with or without an adjuvant we chose aluminum hydroxide gel alum as an adjuvant because of its long safety history for human use we observed that the uv-inactivated sars-cov virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory b cells with the addition of alum to the vaccine formula serum igg production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice though it was still insufficient to elicit serum iga antibodies notably the sars-cov virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant anti-sars-cov antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus furthermore the uv-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node t-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production il-2 il-4 il-5 ifn-c and tnf-a upon restimulation with inactivated sars-cov virion in vitro thus a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a sars vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity
development of necrotizing enterocolitis nec requires a susceptible host typically a premature infant or an infant with congenital heart disease enteral feedings and bacterial colonization although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of nec the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive unlike established normal adult gut microbiota which is quite complex uniform and stable early postnatal bacterial populations are simple diverse and fluid these properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of nec a broad variety of bacterial viral and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental nec frequently however the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals clustered outbreaks of nec in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest but do not prove a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease studies in cronobacter sakazakii the best characterized nec pathogen have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole but rather a characteristic of certain strains which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic the fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in nec progress in understanding the infectious nature of nec may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models
gs-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that showed therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of ebola virus infection it has been administered under compassionate use to two ebola patients both of whom survived and is currently in phase 2 clinical development for treatment of ebola virus disease here we report the antiviral activities of gs-5734 and the parent nucleoside analog across multiple virus families providing evidence to support new indications for this compound against human viruses of significant public health concern
the hemagglutinins has of h9 influenza viruses isolated from birds and mammals of different species were antigenically and genetically analyzed antigenic variants were selected from a/swine/hong kong/10/ 98 h9n2 and a/duck/hokkaido/13/00 h9n2 in the presence of monoclonal antibodies mabs based on the reactivity patterns of these mutants with a panel of mabs at least five non-overlapping antigenic sites were defined using eight mabs which recognized seven distinct epitopes on the h9 ha molecule based on the reactivity patterns with the panel of monoclonal antibodies 21 h9n2 virus strains isolated from birds and mammals were divided into 7 antigenically distinct groups the present findings indicate that it is important to monitor the antigenic variation in h9 influenza viruses the panel of mabs in the present study thus should be useful for detailed antigenic analysis of the h9 has for epidemiological studies the selection of vaccine strains and diagnosis
of recent advances antibodies through passive or active immunization play a central role in prophylaxis against many infectious agents while neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses the relative contribution of fc-dependent and complement-dependent antiviral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies the multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses in addition to virus size influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization these new findings will improve our strategies in therapeutic antibody engineering and rational vaccine design
an indirect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv anti-immunoglobulin ig g elisa based on the s1 portion of the spike protein was validated and compared with an indirect immunofluorescence assay in serum samples from experimentally infected pigs n = 35 anti-igg pedv antibodies were detected as early as 7 days post-infection in field serum samples n = 239 the diagnostic sensitivity of the s1 elisa was 100% and the diagnostic specificity was 94%. the s1 elisa showed no cross-reactivity with antibodies against other porcine coronaviruses colostrum samples n = 133 were also tested for anti-pedv igg and iga the diagnostic sensitivity was 92% for igg and 100% for iga and the diagnostic specificity was 90% for igg and 99.4% for iga these data suggest that the s1 elisa is a sensitive and specific test that could also be used to evaluate pedv colostral immunity
ducks play an important role in transmitting and maintaining mammalian viruses in nature and are a reservoir host of many animal viruses we analyzed the fecal virome of four strains a b c and d of ducks living in isolation by using metagenomic analysis the feces of the ducks tested contained 18 animal virus families the percentage values of rna virus reads compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% a 97.30% b 98.01 c and 67.49% d and were mainly from orthomyxoviridae mimiviridae bunyaviridae picobirnaviridae and reoviridae meanwhile the minority of dna virus reads were related to herpesviridae adenoviridae iridoviridae and other low abundance viral families the percentage values of orthomyxoviridae mimiviridae bunyaviridae picobirnaviridae and herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains a b and c however there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain d in summary this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present these results can be used as a reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential
in this study the performance of 10 serological assays for the diagnosis of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was evaluated a total of 145 sera from 120 patients were tested they were obtained from patients who were serologically positive for m pneumoniae infection as well as from patients who were infected with microorganisms that may cause interstitial pneumonia the following assays were utilized seromp igm and igg seromp recombinant igm iga and igg liaison m pneumoniae igm and igg and m pneumoniae igm iga and igg elisa medac the seromp recombinant and liaison assays both showed low igm specificity and crossreactivity was mainly observed in groups of patients with acute cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus infections for iga the medac assay was less specific than the seromp recombinant assay discrepancies between the four tests were observed in igg analyses and due to the lack of a gold standard 22 results were removed prior to determining the sensitivity and specificity therefore the overall performance of igg assays may be overstated nevertheless the seromp assay demonstrated a lack of sensitivity the seroprevalence of igg appears to be very low raising concerns regarding whether the serological techniques can detect igg levels over time serology remains a biological tool of choice for diagnosing m pneumoniae infection but improvement and standardization of the assays are needed particularly for the determination of igg
bats are reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses that can have a profound impact on human and animal health including lyssaviruses filoviruses paramyxoviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars-covs in the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in contexts where human-bat contact might facilitate more efficient interspecies transmission of viruses we surveyed gastrointestinal tissue obtained from bats collected in caves in nigeria that are frequented by humans et al 2010 identification of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in a leaf-nosed bat in nigeria mbio 14coronavirus consensus pcr and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing revealed the presence of coronavirus sequences related to those of sars-cov in a commerson's leaf-nosed bat hipposideros commersoni additional genomic sequencing indicated that this virus unlike subgroup 2b covs which includes sars-cov is unique comprising three overlapping open reading frames between the m and n genes and two conserved stem-loop ii motifs phylogenetic analyses in conjunction with these features suggest that this virus represents a new subgroup within group 2 covs importance bats order chiroptera suborders megachiroptera and microchiroptera are reservoirs for a wide range of viruses that cause diseases in humans and livestock including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov responsible for the global sars outbreak in 2003 the diversity of viruses harbored by bats is only just beginning to be understood because of expanded wildlife surveillance and the development and application of new tools for pathogen discovery this paper describes a new coronavirus one with a distinctive genomic organization that may provide insights into coronavirus evolution and biology

bats play a significant role in maintaining their ecosystems through pollination dispersal of seeds and control of insect populations but they are also known to host many microorganisms and have been described as natural reservoirs for viruses with zoonotic potential the diversity of viruses in these animals remains largely unknown however because studies are limited by species location virus target or sample type therefore the aim of this study was to detect fragments of viral genomes in bat samples we performed high-throughput sequencing analysis and specific pcr and rt-pcr on pools of anal and oropharyngeal swabs from artibeus lituratus and sturnira lilium collected in southern brazil as a result a member of the family adenoviridae related to human adenovirus c was detected in anal swabs from s lilium in addition we detected a papillomavirus in an anal swab from a lituratus our analyses also allowed the detection of adenoviruses and parvoviruses in oropharyngeal swabs collected from a lituratus these results increase our knowledge about viral diversity and illustrate the importance of conducting virus surveillance in bats
nipah virus niv causes a severe and often fatal neurological disease in humans whilst fruit bats are considered the natural reservoir niv also infects pigs and may cause an unapparent or mild disease direct pig-to-human transmission was responsible for the first and still most devastating niv outbreaks in malaysia and singapore in 1998-99 with nearly 300 human cases and over 100 fatalities pigs can therefore play a key role in the epidemiology of niv by acting as an "amplifying" host the outbreak in singapore ended with the prohibition of pig imports from malaysia and the malaysian outbreak was ended by culling 45% of the country's pig population with costs exceeding us$500 million despite the importance of niv as an emerging disease with the potential for pandemic no vaccines or therapeutics are currently approved for human or livestock use in this mini-review we will discuss current knowledge of niv infection in pigs our ongoing work to develop a niv vaccine for use in pigs and the pig as a model to support human vaccine development
cryptosporidium species are coccidian parasites with a large capacity to reproduce and to disseminate several species are known to infect farm animals although the economic importance of cryptosporidiosis is highly host species dependent this paper reviews the impact of cryptosporidial infections in livestock and poultry for dierent farm animals the cryptosporidium spp that occur as well as their clinical and pathological features and their interactions with other pathogens are described in addition data concerning the prevalence the transmission and the epidemiology of the disease are mentioned and a description of the economic losses associated with cryptosporidiosis in each of the hosts is given cryptosporidiosis seems to be mainly a problem in neonatal ruminants cryptosporidium parvum is considered to be an important agent in the aetiology of the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome of calves lambs and goat kids causing considerable direct and indirect economic losses avian cryptosporidiosis is an emerging health problem in poultry associated with respiratory disease in chickens and other galliformes and with intestinal disease in turkeys and quails because of limited availability of eective drugs the control of cryptosporidiosis relies mainly on hygienic measures and good management #
serum antibodies against human coronavirus oc43 in different age groups were measured by complement fixation cf haemagglutination inhibition hi radial diffusion haemolysis-in-gel hig and solid-phase radioimmunoassay ria methods antigen grown in suckling mouse brain was used in all tests results obtained by the cf and hig tests and the ria were in good agreement with regard t o the presence or absence of antibodies similar results were also obtained with the hi test if nonspecific haemagglutination inhibitors were first removed by treatment with phospholipase c and only titers of 1 20 or greater were considered positive children 6-23 months of age n = 45 were without measurable coronavirus antibodies in all four assays a rapid increase in the prevalence of antibodies then occurred in subsequent age groups and practically all persons 6 years of age or older were found t o have oc43 antibodies as measured by the hig test or the ria the mean antibody levels determined by these two methods continued t o increase however up t o the age group of 10-14 years this increase in antibody levels after the initial antibody incidence plateau may be due t o boosting effects caused by related coronavirus strains since oc43 antigens are known t o cross-react with antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses taken together these data suggest that oc43 virus or an antigenically related coronavirus strain is very common in finland

bats are reservoirs for many different coronaviruses covs as well as many other important zoonotic viruses we sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within colorado from 2007 to 2009 we detected alphacoronavirus rna in bats of 4 species big brown bats eptesicus fuscus 10% prevalence long-legged bats myotis volans 8% prevalence little brown bats myotis lucifugus 3% prevalence and western long-eared bats myotis evotis 2% prevalence overall juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for cov rna as adult bats at two of the rural sampling sites cov rnas were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study cov rna was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for cov rna and later sampled again all became cov rna negative nucleotide sequences in the rdrp gene fell into 3 main clusters all distinct from those of old world bats similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat indicating that a cov may be capable of infecting bats of different genera these data suggest that ongoing evolution of covs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species alphacoronavirus rna was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations 10% and known to have direct contact with people 19% suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses further cov surveillance studies in bats throughout the americas are warranted
in order to survey the infectious situation of canine coronavirus ccv in giant panda population a virus neutralization test detecting specific antibodies against ccv in giant panda's sera was established by using two-fold dilutions of serum and 100 tcidso of the virus the 62 sera samples of giant pandas which were gathered from zoos and reserve region of sichuan province china were detected the neutralization antibody titer of 14 was recognized as the positive criterion 8 sera samples were detected to be positive and the positive rate was 12.9%. the titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 18 to 132 it was the first comprehensive investigation on neutralization antibodies against ccv in giant panda population in china the results of study showed that the infection of ccv in giant panda population was universal which has posed a threat to the health of giant panda therefore it is incumbent on us to study safe and effective vaccines to protect giant panda against ccv infection
emerging viruses pose a major threat to humans and livestock with global public health and economic burdens vaccination remains an effective tool to reduce this threat and yet the conventional cell culture often fails to produce sufficient vaccine dose as an alternative to cell-culture based vaccine virus-like particles vlps are considered as a highpriority vaccine strategy against emerging viruses vlps represent highly ordered repetitive structures via macromolecular assemblies of viral proteins the particulate nature allows efficient uptake into antigen presenting cells stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses towards enhanced vaccine efficacy increasing research activity and translation opportunity necessitate the advances in the design of vlps and new bioprocessing modalities for efficient and cost-effective production herein we describe major achievements and challenges in this endeavor with respect to designing strategies to harnessing the immunogenic potential production platforms downstream processes and some exemplary cases in developing vlp-based vaccines
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is an economically important enteric coronavirus with over a 90% mortality rate in neonatal piglets the virus emerged in the us in 2013 resulting in severe production losses effective vaccine development against pedv is a challenge inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy attenuated vaccines while more effective require a relatively long lead development time are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks to combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated pedv vaccines respectively in this study we tested the hypothesis that subjecting pedv virions to heat treatment at 44 • c for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins followed by exposure to rnase to fragment the genome would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities we expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model following the heat and rnase treatment pedv virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in vero cells indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro strong pedv spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets upon challenge all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology while the unvaccinated controls were not the vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge nor did they develop intestinal lesions thus the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for pedv immunization
dear editor astroviruses astvs family astroviridae are positive-sense singlestranded rna viruses that infect a large diversity of mammalian and avian species 1 in humans eight serotypes have been described worldwide accounting for 2%-9% of all acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis cases in children 2 astvs have been detected from over 80 non-human host species including a large diversity of bat species in asia europe and africa 3 and recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that the long-term evolution of astvs is determined by frequent crossspecies transmission events 45 during the past decade numerous astvs with potential zoonotic transmission have been described highlighting the need for improved knowledge on their biology to prevent future health threats 2 bats are recognized as a major reservoir of infectious agents madagascar shelters over 46 bat species of which nearly 80% are endemic occupying different types of day roosts including natural and synanthropic sites recent investigations have shown that the compositions of malagasy bat species assemblages are correlated with factors associated with the diversity and transmission of infectious agents such as paramyxoviruses and leptospira 67 the detection of new betacoronaviruses in endemic malagasy fruit bats also underlined the urgent need to better understand bat-associated infectious agents and thus assess the potential for spillover to human populations in this major biodiversity hotspot 8 herein malagasy bats were sampled for the detection of astvs in the context of a multilevel research program examining the systematics and biogeography of these animals and their associated infectious agents bats were trapped at two locations ambohitantely and anjohibe using mist nets harp traps and butterfly nets in anjohibe several different species were trapped in a large cave network whereas in ambohitantely two species were sampled at different sites myotis goudoti in a cave roost and mormopterus jugularis in a public school rectal and buccal swabs were obtained using sterile rayon-tipped applicators puritan guilford me usa pooled swabs from each individual bat one rectal+one buccal swab were placed in the same tube containing 1.5 ml of brain heart infusion medium conda madrid spain supplemented with penicillin g 1000 units/ml streptomycin 1 mg/ml kanamycin 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin
bovine coronavirus bcov is a causative agent of respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle and calves bcov infection was also evident in captive wild ruminants recently water deer are recognized as the most common wildlife to approach farmhouses and livestock barns in korea therefore we investigated 77 nasal swab samples from non-captive wild water deer hydropotes inermis between november 2016 and september 2017 and identified three samples positive for coronavirus indicating potential for respiratory shedding the full genomic sequences of the water deer coronavirus were closely related to bcov >98%. therefore effective biosecurity system in bovine farms would be necessary to prevent contact between farm ruminants and free-ranging wild water deer bovine coronavirus carrier nasal swab water deer
the application of the immunoperoxidase ip plaque staining procedure ip test to the diagnosis of canine coronavirus ccv infection was investigated the ip test did not react with sera from either 15 speci¢c pathogen-free spf dogs or 7 spf dogs immunized with a multivalent vaccine including canine parvovirus type 2 canine distemper virus canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parain£uenza virus to compare the ip test with the neutralizing test nt sera from 240 healthy dogs and from 3 experimentally ccv-infected dogs were examined all 60 sera positive for nt antibody were positive for ip antibody and all 180 sera negative for nt antibody were negative for ip antibody in the healthy dogs the ip titres showed similar changes with time after ccv inoculation to those of the nt titres in the experimentally infected dogs these ¢ndings indicate that the ip test speci¢cally detected anti-ccv antibodies when the ip test and nt were compared in dogs with diarrhoeic signs 2.1% of 48 sera and 20.3% of 74 sera which were all negative for nt antibody were positive for ip antibody in the dogs of under one year of age and at least one year of age respectively the di¡erence between the ip and nt titres log 10 ^log 10 for the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age 2.350+0.931 was signi¢cantly larger than that for the healthy dogs 0.982+0.447 p50.0001 the nt titre being negative or very low despite a high ip titre in many diarrhoeic dogs hence the ip test is more able to detect anti-ccv antibodies especially in dogs showing clinical signs the ip-positivity rate was signi¢cantly higher in the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age 48.7% than in the healthy dogs 25.0% w 2 = 19.844 p50.0001 suggesting that ccv may contribute to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs

sera from adults in southern iraq were collected during winter and screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibodies to the two antigenic groups of human coronaviruses the 229e and the oc43 groups 91% of the sera had antibodies to at least one of the groups whereas 4 and 5% of the sera had antibodies to only the 229e or oc43 groups respectively there was significant correlation between the levels of antibody to the 229e and oc43 group coronaviruses in these sera
respiratory syncytial virus rsv was first described 160 years ago but was not officially recognized as a cause of serious illness in children until the late 1950s it has been estimated that virtually all children have had at least one rsv infection by their second birthday rsv is responsible for annual disease outbreaks usually during a defined winter seasonal period that can vary by community and year rsv is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization among young children worldwide infants of young chronologic age and children with predisposing factors such as premature birth pulmonary disease or congenital heart disease are most susceptible to serious illness unlike other viruses immunity to rsv infection is incomplete and short lived and reinfection is common throughout life initial attempts to develop a vaccine in the 1960s met with unexpected and tragic results many children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated wild-type virus developed serious pulmonary disease upon subsequent natural infection numerous other vaccine technologies have since been studied including vectored approaches virus-like particles dna vaccines and live attenuated virus vaccine as of early 2010 only two companies or institutions had rsv vaccine candidates in early clinical trials and no vaccine is likely to be licensed for marketing in the immediate future
to better understand the evolution of hepadnaviruses we sampled bats from guizhou henan and zhejiang provinces china and rodents from zhejiang province genetically diverse hepadnaviruses were identified in a broad range of bat species with an overall prevalence of 13.3%. in contrast no rodent hepadnaviruses were identified the newly discovered bat hepadnaviruses fell into two distinct phylogenetic groups the viruses within the first group exhibited high diversity with some closely related to viruses previously identified in yunnan province strikingly the newly discovered viruses sampled from jiyuan city in the second phylogenetic group were most closely related to those found in bats from west africa suggestive of a long-term association between bats and hepadnaviruses a co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species genera and families overall these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses
human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv two members of the pneumoviridae family account for the majority of severe lower respiratory tract infections worldwide in very young children they are also a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunocompromised adults high levels of neutralizing antibodies mostly directed against the viral fusion f glycoprotein correlate with protection against either hrsv or hmpv however no cross-neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified f proteins based on crystal structures of hrsv f and hmpv f we designed chimeric f proteins in which certain residues of well-characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens the antigenic changes were monitored by elisa with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross-neutralizing antibody responses and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site these results provide a proof of principle for chimeric fusion proteins as single immunogens that can induce cross-neutralizing antibody and protective responses against more than one human pneumovirus
the emergence of influenza viruses resistant to existing classes of antiviral drugs raises concern and there is a need for novel antiviral agents that could be used therapeutically or prophylacticaly surfactant protein d sp-d belongs to the family of ctype lectins which are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with activity against bacteria and viruses including influenza viruses in the present study we evaluated the potential of recombinant porcine sp-d as an antiviral agent against influenza a viruses iavs in vitro to determine the range of antiviral activity thirty iavs of the subtypes h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 that originated from birds pigs and humans were selected and tested for their sensitivity to recombinant sp-d using these viruses it was shown by hemagglutination inhibition assay that recombinant porcine sp-d was more potent than recombinant human sp-d and that especially higher order oligomeric forms of sp-d had the strongest antiviral activity porcine sp-d was active against a broad range of iav strains and neutralized a variety of h1n1 and h3n2 iavs including 2009 pandemic h1n1 viruses using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea we demonstrated that recombinant porcine sp-d prevented attachment of human seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract it was concluded that recombinant porcine sp-d holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against influenza and further development and evaluation in vivo seems warranted citation hillaire mlb van eijk m van trierum se van riel d saelens x et al 2011 assessment of the antiviral properties of recombinant porcine sp-d against various influenza a viruses in vitro plos one 69 e25005

phase i human clinical studies involving therapeutics for emerging and biodefense pathogens with low incidence such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov requires at a minimum preclinical evaluation of efficacy in two well-characterized and robust animal models thus a ferret sars-cov model was evaluated over a period of 58 days following extensive optimization and characterization of the model in order to validate clinical histopathological virological and immunological endpoints ferrets that were infected intranasally with 10 3 tcid 50 sars-cov showed higher body temperature 2-6 d p i sneezing 5-10 d p i lesions 5-7 d p i and decreased wbc/lymphocytes 2-5 d p i sars-cov was detected up to 7 d p i in various tissues and excreta while neutralizing antibody titers rose at 7 d p i and peaked at 14 d p i at 29 d p i one group was challenged with 10 3 tcid 50 sars-cov and an anamnestic response in neutralizing antibodies was evident with no detectable virus this study supports the validity of the ferret model for use in evaluating efficacy of potential therapeutics to treat sars
despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of rsv-associated disease but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection in contrast the role of memory cd8 t cells in protecting against a secondary rsv infection is less established we recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory cd8 t cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following rsv infection but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by ifn-γ to evaluate the ability of rsv-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory cd8 t cell-mediated immunopathology mice with high-magnitude memory cd8 t cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to rsv challenge neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following rsv challenge compared with igg-treated controls neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication which caused a substantial reduction in memory cd8 t cell activation and ifn-γ production directly resulting in survival in contrast therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity mortality or ifn-γ levels despite significantly reducing lung viral titers therefore only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory cd8 t cell-mediated immunopathology following rsv infection overall our results have important implications for the development of future rsv vaccines mucosal immunology 2020 13507-517 https//doi
the prevalence of antibodies to bovine coronavirus bcv and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv infections was studied in 20 conventional and 20 organic dairy herds the organic farms had produced 'certified' milk for at least 2 years on two occasions with a 1-year interval 699 serum samples from 624 peri-parturient cows were tested by elisa for antibodies to bcv and brsv accompanying data relating to the sampled animals were collected in order to identify potential factors associated with increased antibody prevalence the antibody prevalence was high at both sampling times with approximately 85% and 80% of animals positive for antibodies to bcv and to brsv respectively conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to bcv and brsv than the organically managed herds p < 0.01 animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence p < 0.001 the findings of this study suggest that organic farm management may be effective in reducing the seroprevalence of these viruses relative to conventional farming methods
the vaccines developed over the first two hundred years since jenner's lifetime have accomplished striking reductions of infection and disease wherever applied pasteur's early approaches to vaccine development attenuation and inactivation are even now the two poles of vaccine technology today purification of microbial elements genetic engineering and improved knowledge of immune protection allow direct creation of attenuated mutants expression of vaccine proteins in live vectors purification and even synthesis of microbial antigens and induction of a variety of immune responses through manipulation of dna rna proteins and polysaccharides both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology the profusion of new vaccines enables new populations to be targeted for vaccination and requires the development of routes of administration additional to injection with all this come new problems in the production regulation and distribution of vaccines
we previously demonstrated the presence of ige directed to fetal calf serum fcs in the sera from dogs that developed allergic reactions after vaccination in this study by an immunoblot analysis we investigated the ige-reactive components of fcs using sera from 16 dogs that exhibited allergic reactions after vaccination the immunoblot analysis revealed that several fcs proteins of approximately 25- 50- 66- 75- 120- and 175-kda strongly reacted with ige in the sera from dogs that showed post-vaccination allergic reactions the 66-kda band was detected in the sera from 14 of the 16 dog serum samples analyzed in the immunoblot analysis for fcs and it was speculated to be albumin based on its molecular weight however serum ige reactivity to bovine serum albumin could be detected in only four of the 14 dog samples these findings demonstrated that a variety of fcs components including albumin could function as allergens in dogs that developed allergic reactions after vaccination #
porcine parvovirus ppv is a dna virus that causes reproductive failure in gilts and sows resulting in embryonic and fetal losses worldwide epitope mapping of ppv is important for developing new vaccines in this study we used spot synthesis analysis for epitope mapping of the capsid proteins of ppv nadl-2 strain and correlated the findings with predictive data from immunoinformatics the virus was exposed to three conditions prior to inoculation in pigs native untreated high hydrostatic pressure 350 mpa for 1 h at room temperature and high hydrostatic pressure 350 mpa for 1 h at − 18°c and was compared with a commercial vaccine produced using inactivated ppv the screening of serum samples detected 44 positive spots corresponding to 20 antigenic sites each type of inoculated antigen elicited a distinct epitope set in silico prediction located linear and discontinuous epitopes in b cells that coincided with several epitopes detected in spot synthesis of sera from pigs that received different preparations of inoculum the conditions tested elicited antibodies against the vp1/vp2 antigen that differed in relation to the response time and the profile of structurally available regions that were recognized
yersinia pestis the cause of plague could be weaponized unfortunately development of new vaccines is limited by lack of correlates of protection we used pre-and post-vaccination sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a flagellin adjuvanted f1/v vaccine trial to evaluate for protective markers here we report for the first time in humans that inverse caspase-3 levels which are measures of protective antibody significantly increased by 29% and 75% on days 14 and 28 post-second vaccination respectively in addition there were significant increases in t-cell responses on day 28 post-second vaccination the strongest positive and negative correlations between protective antibody levels and gene expression signatures were identified for ifng and ensg00000225107 genes respectively flagellin/f1/v subunit vaccine induced macrophage-protective antibody and significant cd4 + t-cell responses several genes associated with these responses were identified that could serve as potential correlates of protection npj vaccines 2020 56 https//doi
in felids feline leukemia virus felv infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive virus readily eliminated and never detectable to progressive infection persistent viremia and viral shedding recently a novel outcome was postulated for low felv infectious doses naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted indicating infection but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood felv provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression to investigate the impact of low felv doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses blood p27 proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection tissue proviral loads were determined as well the immune response was monitored by measuring felv whole virus and p45 antibodies and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen focma assay one cat showed regressive infection transient antigenemia persistent provirus-positivity and seroconversion with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice in 7 of the 20 remaining cats focma assay positivity was the only sign of infection while all other tests were negative overall the results show that felv low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection therefore commonly used detection methods do not detect all felv-infected animals possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection felv / pathogenesis / infection outcome / abortive infection / focma assay
canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a major cause of morbidity in dogs worldwide and is associated with a number of new and emerging pathogens in a large multi-centre european study the prevalences of four key emerging cird pathogens canine respiratory coronavirus crcov canine pneumovirus cnpnv influenza a and mycoplasma cynos m cynos were estimated and risk factors for exposure infection and clinical disease were investigated cird affected 66% 381/572 of the dogs studied including both pet and kennelled dogs disease occurrence and severity were significantly reduced in dogs vaccinated against classic cird agents canine distemper virus cdv canine adenovirus 2 cav-2 and canine parainfluenza virus cpiv but substantial proportions 65.7% 201/306 of vaccinated dogs remained affected crcov and cnpnv were highly prevalent across the different dog populations with overall seropositivity and detection rates of 47% and 7.7% for crcov and 41.7% and 23.4% for cnpnv respectively and their presence was associated with increased occurrence and severity of clinical disease antibodies to crcov had a protective effect against crcov infection and more severe clinical signs of cird but antibodies to cnpnv did not involvement of m cynos and influenza a in cird was less apparent despite 45% of dogs being seropositive for m cynos only 0.9% were pcr positive for m cynos only 2.7% of dogs were seropositive for influenza a and none were positive by pcr
neonatal diarrheal disease is responsible for significant economic losses to the livestock industries in canada and around the world microbes responsible are diverse and include escherichia coli salmonella rotavirus coronavirus and cryptosporidia while the use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in recent decades the increasing pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics in animals has caused the livestock industry to seek appropriate alternatives antimicrobial/host defense peptides are natural compounds present on skin and in secretions in plants and animals that are microbicidal for bacteria viruses and parasites and they stimulate the immune system to combat infectious diseases our objective is to establish orally-obtained host defense peptides hdps as an alternative to antibiotics to protect against neonatal diarrheal disease in calves we devised a method to allow the cow udder to act as a factory to produce hdps so that suckling calves will receive a continuous oral dose of hdps over several weeks to protect them against neonatal diarrhea we will use adenovirus to deliver a gene coding for several hdps in-frame into mammary epithelial cells the epithelial cells will secrete the hdp protein into milk to be consumed by the suckling calves and trypsin in the calf gut will release the hdps through cleavage thus the novelty of this research lies not only in the proposed alternative to antibiotics to protect neonates against disease but in the method by which we introduce the peptides to the suckling offspring
recently we have realized that viruses numerically dominate all life although viruses are known to affect host survival in populations this has not been previously evaluated in the context of host group selection group selection per se is not a currently accepted idea and its apparent occurrence is explained by statistical gene frequency models of kin selection viruses were not considered in such models prevalent views associate viruses and disease yet many viruses establish species-specific persistent inapparent infections that are stable on an evolutionary time scale such persistent infections can have large effects on relative reproductive fitness of competing host populations in this essay i present arguments on how persistent infections can promote population survival mouse hepatitis virus is used as well studied examplar to reevaluate the theoretical basis of the mouse haystack model of m smith this virus-centric re-examination concludes that viruses can indeed affect and promote relative group selection
canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a multi-factorial infection that affects many kennelled dogs despite the wide use of vaccination current vaccines aim to protect against viral agents and a single bacterial agent bordetella bronchiseptica we sought to examine the role of streptococcal species in cird the isolation and identification of streptococci in the lower respiratory tract of clinically healthy dogs and those with cird were used to correlate the presence of specific streptococcal species with respiratory disease in this study we report that the presence of s equi subsp zooepidemicus is associated with increasing severity of disease in a population of kennelled dogs with endemic cird
middle east respiratory syndrome mers is an acute high-mortality-rate severe infectious disease caused by an emerging mers coronavirus mers-cov that causes severe respiratory diseases the continuous spread and great pandemic potential of mers-cov make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines we previously demonstrated that the application of gram-positive enhancer matrix gem particles as a bacterial vector displaying the mers-cov receptor-binding domain rbd is a very promising mers vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies we have also used the rabies virus rv as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the mers-cov s1 spike protein on the surface of the rv in this study we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in balb/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses the results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the gem particles vector however the gem particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response even at a very low dose of 1 µg these results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model this discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for mers-cov vaccine development but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens
the evaluation of the immunogenicity of sabin strain based inactivated poliovirus vaccines sipv necessitates the use of wild strains in neutralization assays to assess the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies the live virus strains including wild and sabin strains must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories to develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus we constructed mahoney mef-1 and saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins afterward we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test pnt and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility we tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sipv vaccines by pnt and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests cnt a strong correlation was observed between two methods with the correlation coefficients of all three types of ipv vaccines being greater than 0.82 p < 0.0001 the geometric mean titer gmt values obtained by pnt were approximately four times higher than that by cnt revealing the better sensitivity of pnt in conclusion pnt is a safe rapid and sensitive quantitative assay with the potential of being an alternative for the evaluation of the potency of polio vaccines article history
background the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature and originate from wildlife reservoirs borna disease caused by borna disease virus 1 bodv-1 is an infectious disease affecting mammals but recently it has also been shown to cause fatal encephalitis in humans the endemic character of borna disease points towards a nature-bound reservoir with only one shrew species identified as reservoir host to date bats have been identified as reservoirs of a variety of zoonotic infectious agents endogenous borna-like elements in the genome of certain bat species additionally point towards co-evolution of bats with bornaviruses and therefore raise the question whether bats could serve as a potential reservoir of orthobornaviruses methods frozen brain samples n = 257 of bats of seven different genera from germany were investigated by orthobornaviral rt-pcr additionally tissue slides of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of a subset of these bats n = 140 were investigated for orthobornaviral phosphoprotein by immunohistochemistry results the brain samples were tested by rt-pcr without any evidence of orthobornavirus specific amplicons immunohistochemistry revealed a faint immunoreaction in 3/140 bats but with an untypical staining pattern for viral antigen conclusions rt-pcr-screening showed no evidence for orthobornaviral rna in the investigated bats however immunohistochemistry results should be investigated further to elucidate whether the reaction might be associated with expressed endogenous bornaviral elements or other so far unknown bornaviruses
tuberculosis tb remains a serious health problem worldwide and an urgent need exists to improve or replace the available vaccine mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guérin bcg most vaccination protocols adapt two or three doses to induce long-term lasting immunity our previous study showed that the naked dna encoding the triple-antigen fusion tfp846 rv3615c-mtb10.4-rv2660c induced robust t cellular immune responses accompanying four inoculations against mycobacteria infection however a number of compliance issues exist in some areas lacking the appropriate medical infrastructure with multiple administrations in this study a novel vesicular stomatitis virus expressing tfp846 vsv-846 was developed and the immune responses elicited by vsv-846 were evaluated we observed that intranasal delivery of vsv-846 induced a potent antigen-specific t cell response following a single dose and vsv-846 efficiently controlled bacterial growth to levels ∼10-fold lower than that observed in the mock group 6 weeks post-infection in bcg-infected mice importantly mice immunized with vsv-846 provided long-term protection against mycobacteria infection compared with those receiving p846 or bcg immunization increased memory t cells were also observed in the spleens of vsv-846-vaccinated mice which could be a potential mechanism associated with long-term protective immune response these findings supported the use of vsv as an antigen delivery vector with the potential for tb vaccine development
healthcare settings have played a major role in propagation of ebola virus ebov outbreaks healthcare workers hcws have elevated risk of contact with ebov-infected patients particularly if safety precautions are not rigorously practiced we conducted a serosurvey to determine seroprevalence against multiple ebov antigens among hcws of boende health zone democratic republic of the congo the site of a 2014 ebov outbreak interviews and specimens were collected from 565 consenting hcws overall 234 41.4% of enrolled hcws were reactive to at least 1 ebov protein 159 28.1% were seroreactive for anti-glycoprotein immunoglobulin g igg 89 15.8% were seroreactive for anti-nucleoprotein igg and 54 9.5% were vp40 positive additionally sera from 16 2.8% hcws demonstrated neutralization capacity these data demonstrate that a significant proportion of hcws have the ability to neutralize virus despite never having developed ebola virus disease symptoms highlighting an important and poorly documented aspect of ebov infection and progression

this study represents the initial part of an investigation into the potential for non-native wild freeliving muntjac deer muntiacus reevesi to carry viruses that could be a threat to livestock a degenerate pcr assay was used to screen a range of tissues from muntjac deer culled in northern ireland for the presence of herpesviral nucleic acids this was followed by sequencing of pcr amplicons and phylogenetic analysis we report the detection of a novel gammaherpesvirus most closely related to a type 2 ruminant rhadinovirus from mule deer it remains to be determined if this new virus is pathogenic to deer or presents a risk to food security through the susceptibility of domestic livestock keywords muntjac deer á muntiacus reevesi á rhadinovirus á gammaherpesvirus á degenerate pcr deer especially introduced species are of major concern with regards to impacts on biodiversity forestry and agriculture . deer also affect humans directly causing fatalities and injury through deer-vehicle collisions . consequently expansion of non-native introduced and
background hematologic and serum biochemical reference values obtained from captive or free-ranging wildlife populations may not be comparable as there can be significant variations due to preanalytic and analytic differences including methods of capture and restraint overall management in captivity including diet and composition of animal groups and analytic methods being used hematology and serum biochemistry have never been studied in captive or free-ranging populations of sechuran foxes lycalopex sechurae objectives the purposes of the study were to determine hematologic and serum biochemical ri in sechuran foxes and to explore differences in these variables related to sex and overall life circumstances methods blood samples were obtained from 15 free-ranging and 15 captive sechuran foxes hematology variables were assessed by blood smear examination and automated analyzer methodology serum biochemical analysis was performed by automated analyzer methodology descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable data obtained from free-ranging and captive groups were statistically compared and ris were calculated results captive sechuran foxes had significantly p < .05 higher mch mchc and eosinophil counts and significantly lower band neutrophil counts than free-ranging foxes free-ranging sechuran foxes had significantly p < .05 higher serum lipase and globulins and significantly lower albumin total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin than captive foxes conclusions these findings suggest that there are hematologic and serum biochemical differences between captive and free-ranging sechuran fox populations hence such differences should be considered when using these variables to assess the health status of this species blood canidae wild animals zoo animals foxes feed on wild plant species or wild fruit and during the wet
crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus cchfv is a tick-born virus of the nairovirus genus within the bunyaviridae family which is widespread and causes high fatality the nucleocapsid of cchfv is comprised of n proteins that are encoded by the s segment in this research the n protein of cchfv was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus under an electron microscope virus-like particles vlps with various size and morphology were observed in cytoplasmic vesicles in the infected cells sucrose-gradient purification of the cell lysate indicated that the vlps were mainly located in the upper fraction after ultracentrifugation which was confirmed by western blot analysis and immuno-electron microscopy iem
the induction of immunological memory which is mediated by memory t and b cells is central to adaptive protective immunity to pathogens induced by previous infection and is the cornerstone of effective vaccine design recent studies in mice have suggested that memory t cells that accumulate in tissues termed tissue-resident memory t trm cells play a crucial role in maintaining long-term protective immunity to mucosal pathogens cd4 and cd8 trm cells can be induced following infection at mucosal sites or the skin where they are maintained and poised to respond rapidly to reinfection with the same pathogen trm cells can also be generated by vaccination but their induction is influenced by a number of factors including the type of vaccine the adjuvant and the route of immunization live attenuated vaccines appear to be more effective than killed or subunit vaccines at inducing trm cells and mucosal immunization especially by intranasal route is more effective than parenteral delivery however evidence is emerging that formulation of killed or subunit vaccines with novel adjuvants especially those that generate th1 and th17 responses can promote the induction of trm cells while trm cells are also present at high number in mucosal tissues in humans one of the challenge will be to develop methodologies for routine quantification of these cells in humans nevertheless the identification of approaches for optimum induction of trm cells in mice should assist in the design of more effective vaccines that sustain protective immunity against a range of human pathogens
while classical virology techniques such as virus culture electron microscopy or classical pcr had been unsuccessful in identifying the causative agent responsible for the fulminating disease of guinea fowl we identifi ed a novel avian gammacoronavirus associated with the disease using metagenomics nextgeneration sequencing is an unbiased approach that allows the sequencing of virtually all the genetic material present in a given sample
coronaviruses covs can cause mild to severe disease in humans and animals their host range and environmental spread seem to have been largely underestimated and they are currently being investigated for their potential medical relevance infectious bronchitis virus ibv belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of ibv is poorly understood in the present study we examined 1002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the beringia area for the presence of covs and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses we detected diverse covs by rt-pcr in wild birds in the beringia area sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to ibv these findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically we concluded that covs are widespread among wild birds in beringia and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised thus avian cov can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic covs considering the great animal health and economic impact of ibv as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as sarscoronavirus it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in cov infection biology and epidemiology
background the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel 11 vaccine targets for protective immunity against sars-cov-2 consistent with observations for 12 sars-cov a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 sars outbreak early reports 13 identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for sars cov-2.14 methods in this study we leveraged hla-i and hla-ii t cell epitope prediction tools from 15 recon® real-time epitope computation for oncology our bioinformatic pipeline that was 16 developed using proteomic profiling of individual hla-i and hla-ii alleles to predict rules for 17 peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles we applied these binding predictors to viral 18 genomes from the coronaviridae family and specifically to identify sars-cov-2 t cell 19 epitopes 20 2 results to test the suitability of these tools to identify viral t cell epitopes we first validated 1 hla-i and hla-ii predictions on coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the virus 2 pathogen database and analysis resource vipr database we then use our hla-i and hla-ii 3 predictors to identify 11776 hla-i and 7991 hla-ii candidate binding peptides across all 12 4 open reading frames orfs of sars-cov-2 this extensive list of identified candidate peptides 5 is driven by the length of the orfs and the significant number of hla-i and hla-ii alleles that 6 we are able to predict 74 and 83 respectively providing over 99% coverage for the us 7 european and asian populations for both hla-i and hla-ii from our sars-cov-2 predicted 8 peptide-hla-i allele pairs 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the vipr 9 database originating from other forms of coronaviruses 320 of these pairs 89.1% had a 10 positive mhc-binding assay result this analysis reinforces the validity our predictions
we previously showed that an intraperitoneal infection with mouse hepatitis virus mhv persists in interferon-g ifn-g-deficient c57bl/6 b6-gko mice and results in subacute fatal peritonitis which bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis to examine the role of other host factors in mhv infection in mice ifn-g-deficient mice with a balb/c background balb-gko were infected intraperitoneally with mhv and compared with b6-gko mice in contrast to b6-gko mice balb-gko mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure the viral titer of the liver in balb-gko mice was significantly higher than that in b6-gko mice all hepatocytes in balb-gko mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected b6-gko mice the serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected balb-gko mice were higher than that of b6-gko mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice administration of exogenous ifn-g to balb-gko partially inhibited the acute death these results indicate that balb-gko and b6-gko mice clearly show different diseases following mhv infection although wild type counterparts of both mice apparently showed the same clinical course after mhv infection

background the recent ebola virus ebov epidemic highlights the need for efficacious virucidal products to help prevent infection and limit the spread of ebola virus disease however there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against ebov because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide the virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the european standard en144762013/fpra12015 modified vaccinia virus ankara mva was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. for ebov also an enveloped virus the suitability of mva as a surrogate needs to be proven the aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine pvp-i formulations against ebov 4 % pvp-i skin cleanser 7.5 % pvp-i surgical scrub 10 % pvp-i solution and 3.2 % pvp-i and 78 % alcohol solution the formulations were tested with mva to define the test conditions and as a secondary objective the suitability of mva as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like ebov was assessed methods according to en14476 a standard suspension test was used for mva large-volume plating was used for ebov to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects all products were tested under clean 0.3 g/l bsa and dirty 3.0 g/l bsa + 3.0 ml/l erythrocytes conditions with mva for 15 30 and 60 s the concentration-contact time values obtained with mva were verified for ebov results viral titres of mva and ebov were reduced by >99.99 % to >99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of the test products for 15 seconds conclusions all products showed excellent virucidal efficacy against ebov demonstrating the important role pvp-i can play in helping to prevent and limit the spread of ebola virus disease the efficacy against both test viruses after 15 s is helpful information for the implementation of guidance for people potentially exposed to ebov and confirms the excellent virucidal efficacy of pvp-i against enveloped viruses mva was found to be a suitable surrogate for enveloped viruses like ebov
we determined the untranslated 5 -leader sequence for three different isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv pathogenic european-and american-types as well as an american-type vaccine strain 5 -leader from european-and american-type prrsv differed in length 220 and 190 nt respectively and exhibited only approximately 50% nucleotide homology nevertheless highly conserved areas were identified in the leader of all 3 prrsv isolates which constitute candidate motifs for binding of proteins involved in viral replication these comparative data provide a priori knowledge for mutational identification of virulence determinants in the 5 nontranslated part of the prrsv genome
bats a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents of significance to human and animal health in the present study we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families in particular from flying foxes pteropodidae eidolon helvum in west africa and from two species of new world leaf-nosed fruit bats phyllostomidae artibeus jamaicensis and artibeus lituratus in central america a sequence-independent virus discovery technique vidisca was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses a parv4-like virus named eh-btpv-1 in eidolon helvum from ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in artibeus jamaicensis from panama aj-btpv-1 those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. aj-btpv-1 was also found in artibeus lituratus 5.5%. both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations up to 10e8 and to 10e10 copies/ml for aj-btpv-1 and eh-btpv-1 respectively eh-btpv-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats brain lungs liver spleen kidneys and intestine and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock we also provide evidence that a variety of parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin ecologies and climatic ranges
twenty-two flocks of turkeys affected by enteric problems with ages between 10 and 104 days and located in the southern region of brazil were surveyed for turkey by pcr for turkey astrovirus type 2 tastv-2 turkey coronavirus tcov hemorrhagic enteritis virus hev rotavirus reovirus salmonella spp and lawsonia intracellularis li infections eleven profiles of pathogen combination were observed the most frequently encountered pathogen combinations were tcov-li followed by tcov-tastv-2-li tcov-tastv-2 only tcov was detected as the sole pathogen in three flocks eight and 19 flocks of the 22 were positive for tastv-2 and tcov respectively six were positive for salmonella spp and l intracellularis was detected in 12 turkey flocks reovirus and hev were not detected in this survey these results throw new light on the multiple etiology of enteritis in turkeys the implications of these findings and their correlation with the clinical signs are comprehensively discussed illustrating the complexity of the enteric diseases
the classic development of vaccines is lengthy tedious and may not necessarily be successful as demonstrated by the case of hiv this is especially a problem for emerging pathogens that are newly introduced into the human population and carry the inherent risk of pandemic spread in a naïve population for such situations a considerable number of different platform technologies are under development these are also under development for pathogens where directly derived vaccines are regarded as too complicated or even dangerous due to the induction of inefficient or unwanted immune responses causing considerable side-effects as for dengue virus among platform technologies are plasmid-based dna vaccines rna replicons single-round infectious vector particles or replicating vaccine-based vectors encoding a critical antigens of the target pathogens among the latter recombinant measles viruses derived from vaccine strains have been tested measles vaccines are among the most effective and safest life-attenuated vaccines known therefore the development of schwarz- moraten- or aik-c-strain derived recombinant vaccines against a wide range of mostly viral but also bacterial pathogens was quite straightforward these vaccines generally induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses in appropriate animal models i e transgenic mice or nonhuman primates also in the recent first clinical phase i trial the results have been quite encouraging the trial indicated the expected safety and efficacy also in human patients interestingly independent from the level of prevalent anti-measles immunity before the trial thereby recombinant measles vaccines expressing additional antigens are a promising platform for future vaccines
astroviruses cause disease in a variety of species yet little is known about the epidemiology of a majority of astroviruses including porcine astrovirus type 3 poastv3 which is a putative cause of polioencephalomyelitis in swine accordingly a cross-sectional study was conducted on sow farms with or without reported poastv3-associated neurologic disease in growing pigs weaned from those farms additionally a conveniently selected subset of piglets from one farm was selected for gross and histologic evaluation the distribution of poastv3 in the enteric system was evaluated through in situ hybridization poastv3 as detected by rt-qpcr on fecal samples was frequently detected across sows and piglets 66-90% on all farms 65-85%. poastv3 was detected subsequently at a similar detection frequency 77% vs 85% on one farm after three months viral shedding as determined by the cycle quantification value suggests that piglets shed higher quantities of virus than adult swine no link between gastrointestinal disease and poastv3 was found however poastv3 was detected by in situ in myenteric plexus neurons of piglets elucidating a possible route of spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system these data suggest poastv3 has endemic potential is shed in the feces at greater quantities by suckling piglets when compared to sows and infection is widespread on farms in which it is detected
immunization of mucosal surfaces has become an attractive route of vaccine delivery because of its ability to induce mucosal immunity although various methods of inducing mucosal immunity are being developed our laboratory has focused on developing adenoviruses as replication-competent and replication -incompetent vectors the present report will summarize our progress in sequencing the entire bovine adenovirus-3 genome and identifying regions which can be deleted and subsequently used as insertion sites for foreign genes in developing recombinant viral vaccines using these recombinant viruses we demonstrated the 'proof-of-principle' in developing mucosal immunity and more importantly inducing protection against bovine herpes virus in a natural host -cattle finally we demonstrated that immunity and protection occurred even in animals that had pre-existing antibodies to the vector
background recent studies have clearly demonstrated the enormous virus diversity that exists among wild animals this exemplifies the required expansion of our knowledge of the virus diversity present in wildlife as well as the potential transmission of these viruses to domestic animals or humans methods in the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples n = 42 collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of spain using random pcr in combination with next-generation sequencing samples were collected from american mink neovison vison european mink mustela lutreola european polecat mustela putorius european pine marten martes martes stone marten martes foina eurasian otter lutra lutra and eurasian badger meles meles of the family of mustelidae common genet genetta genetta of the family of viverridae red fox vulpes vulpes of the family of canidae and european wild cat felis silvestris of the family of felidae results a number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected including a theilovirus phleboviruses an amdovirus a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses conclusions using random pcr in combination with next generation sequencing sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal samples collected from spanish carnivores detected novel viruses highlight the viral diversity that is present in fecal material of wild carnivores
canine parvovirus type 2 cpv2 is one of the most important intestinal pathogens in dogs and puppies cpv2 has been evolved into three genetic and antigenic variants 2a 2b and 2c which are distributed worldwide we reported the first study of genetic diversity of cpv2 in chile sixty-five samples were collected from puppies presenting with severe gastroenteritis and different vaccination statuses pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp and partial sequencing of the coding region of the structural viral protein vp2 was performed thirty of a total of 65 samples tested positive by pcr out of which 19 were further classified as cpv2c and one as cpv2a using rflp and sanger sequencing the phylogeny was in concordance with the rflp analysis this is the first report of the genetic characterization of cpv2 in chile and reveals a high occurrence of cpv2c
neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle among enteropathogens cryptosporidium spp are primary causes of diarrhea but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle from january to april in 2016 severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province of east china approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy in this study 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay eia in a post-outbreak investigation 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp by eia and pcr respectively to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm cryptosporidium spp were genotyped using established techniques initial eia tests showed that 15/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for cryptosporidium parvum while 8/18 were positive for rotavirus the overall infection rate of cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7% with odds of the cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak four cryptosporidium spp were identified after the outbreak including c parvum n = 79 cryptosporidium ryanae n = 48 cryptosporidium bovis n = 31 and cryptosporidium andersoni n = 3 with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals infection with c parvum 73/79 was found in the majority of calves aged 3 weeks consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak all c parvum isolates were identified as subtype iida19g1 in the post-outbreak investigation c parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves c ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre-and post-weaned calves while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that c bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves thus we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by c parvum iida19g1 in dairy calves more attention should be directed toward preventing the dissemination of this virulent subtype in china.ó
recombinant subvirual particles retain similar antigenic features of their authentic viral capsids and thus have been applied as nonreplicating subunit vaccines against viral infection and illness additionally the self-assembled polyvalent subviral particles are excellent platforms to display foreign antigens for immune enhancement for vaccine development these subviral particle-based vaccines are noninfectious and thus safer than the conventional live attenuated and inactivated vaccines while several vlp vaccines are available in the markets numerous others including dual vaccines against more than one pathogen are under clinical or preclinical development this article provides an update of these efforts
zoonoses are a worldwide public health concern accounting for approximately 75% of human infectious diseases in addition zoonoses adversely affect agricultural production and wildlife we review some mathematical models developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and identify areas where further modeling efforts are needed
an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in humans associated with a new coronavirus was reported in southeast asia europe and north america in early 2003 to address speculations that the virus originated in domesticated animals or that domestic species were susceptible to the virus we inoculated 6week-old pigs and chickens intravenously intranasally ocularly and orally with 106 pfu of sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov clinical signs did not develop in any animal nor were gross pathologic changes evident on postmortem examinations attempts at virus isolation were unsuccessful however viral rna was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in blood of both species during the first week after inoculation and in chicken organs at 2 weeks after inoculation virus-neutralizing antibodies developed in the pigs our results indicate that these animals do not play a role as amplifying hosts for sars-cov
pseudotyped viral particle production has been used extensively and broadly for many viruses to evaluate levels of neutralizing antibodies viral entry inhibitors and vaccine immunogenicity this assay is extremely safe and useful alternative to live virus-based assay without the need for high containment facilities in this chapter we describe the generation of mers-cov pseudotyped viral particles merspp expressing fulllength spike protein using second-generation lentiviral packaging system this platform is optimized to generate high titer of merspp and to test sera from different mammalian species
hantaviruses are the causative agents of hfrs and hcps hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome two severe and often fatal human diseases mortality from hfrs varies between hantaviruses hantaan and dobrava show the highest seoul intermediate and puumala low mortality saaremaa genetically closely related to dobrava is also known to induce hfrs with low or no mortality in this study mice were inoculated with dobrava and saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility lethality viremia nitric oxide production and antibody responses out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of dobrava virus respectively 1/8 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18e26 days in all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production all suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50 500 or 5000 focus-forming units of saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted clearly lower viral titers were observed for the saaremaa virus-inoculated mice also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection compared to those in mice that died following dobrava virus infection dobrava saaremaa puumala and hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic and the anti-nucleocapsid protein igg2a/igg1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with dobrava virus than in those inoculated with saaremaa virus elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice and inosÿ/ÿ mice like normal mice cleared viremia in conclusion we show that dobrava virus and saaremaa virus induce distinct differences in terms of survival viremia nitric oxide production and antibody responses in mice
bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv has been recognised as an important pathogen in calf pneumonia for 30 years but surprisingly few effective infection models for studies of the immune response and the pathogenesis in the natural host have been established we present a reproducible experimental infection model for brsv in 2-5-month-old conventionally reared jersey calves thirty-four colostrum-fed calves were inoculated once by aerosol and intratracheal injection with brsv respiratory disease was recorded in 91% of the brsv-inoculated calves 72% had an accompanying rise in rectal temperature and 83% exhibited >5% consolidation of the lung tissue the disease closely resembled natural outbreaks of brsv-related pneumonia and detection of brsv in nasal secretions and lung tissues confirmed the primary role of brsv nine mock-inoculated control calves failed to develop respiratory disease this model is a valuable tool for the study of the pathogenesis of brsv and for vaccine efficacy studies
the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first discovered in late 2012 and has gone on to cause over 1800 infections and 650 deaths there are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccinations for mers-cov the mers-cov spike s protein is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells is immunodominant and induces neutralizing antibodies in vivo all of which make the s protein an ideal target for anti-mers-cov vaccines in this study we demonstrate protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine and matrix-m1 adjuvant combination in mice the mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine produced high titer anti-s neutralizing antibody and protected mice from mers-cov infection in vivo
anti-coronaviral activity of a mixture of oleoresins and essential oils from botanicals designated qr448a was examined in vitro and in vivo treatment of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv with qr448a reduced the virus titer as measured in two laboratory host systems vero e6 cells and embryonating eggs the effect of qr448a on ibv in chickens was also investigated administering qr448a to chickens at a 120 dilution by spray 2 h before challenge with ibv was determined to be the most effective treatment treatment decreased the severity of clinical signs and lesions in the birds and lowered the amount of viral rna in the trachea treatment with qr448a protected chickens for up to 4 days posttreatment from clinical signs of disease but not from infection and decreased transmission of ibv over a 14-day period anti-ibv activity of qr448a was greater prior to virus attachment and entry indicating that the effect is virucidal in addition qr448a had activity against both massachusetts and arkansas type ib viruses indicating that it can be expected to be effective against ibv regardless of serotype to our knowledge this is the first report on the in vivo use of a virucidal mixture of compounds effective against the coronavirus ibv
a 73-year-old man was confirmed to have an influenza a h7n9 virus infection and the causative agent a/beijing/02/2014h7n9 virus was isolated genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the virus belonged to a novel genotype which probably emerged and further reassorted with other h9 or h7 viruses in poultry before transmitting to humans this virus caused a severe infection with high levels of cytokines and neutralizing antibodies eventually the patient was cured after serially combined treatments taken together our findings indicated that this novel genotype of the human h7n9 virus did not evolve directly from the first beijing isolate a/beijing/01/2013h7n9 suggesting that the h7n9 virus has not obtained the ability for human-to-human transmissibility and the virus only evolves in poultry and then infects human by direct contact hence the major measures to prevent human h7n9 virus infection are still to control and standardize the live poultry trade early antiviral treatment with combination therapies including mechanical ventilation nutrition support and symptomatic treatment are effective for h7n9 infection
this prospective longitudinal study investigated the epidemiology of enteric disease associated with infections in calves aging up to 70 days a total of 850 fecal samples were collected from 67 calves seventeen isolates of salmonella spp were recovered from feces of 11 calves 16.4 % and statistical analysis revealed no association between the presence of salmonella spp and clinical signs of diarrhea or age virulence factors of escherichia coli were identified in 103 strains eae 7 k99/sta 7 stx1 7 stx1/eae 36 stx1/stx2/eae 2 stx2 43 and stx2/eae 1 there was statistical association between diarrheic animals carrying e coli stx1/eae + in their feces at 2 and 4 weeks of age p= 0.003 and e coli stx2 + at 5 weeks of age p=0.03 rotavirus was detected in 49 5.76 % fecal samples collected from 33 calves 49.2 %. the presence of rotavirus was correlated with diarrheic feces p<0.0001 rather than feces with normal consistency there was a significant relationship between age group and diarrhea p = 0.001 bovine coronavirus bcov was detected in 93 fecal samples collected from 46 calves 68.6 %. there was an association p<0.0001 between diarrheic animals positive for bcov and age groups the results demonstrate the importance of the pathogens studied in the etiology of diarrhea in calves

background porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs is one of the most significant swine diseases worldwide despite its relevance serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection have not yet been identified surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry seldi-tof ms is a reproducible accurate and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum this work describes the seldi-tof ms analyses of sera of 60 prrsv-positive and 60 prrsv-negative as measured by pcr asymptomatic large white piglets at weaning sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin < 4.52 μg/ml were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1-200 kda were obtained with the cm10 imac30 and h50 surfaces results a total of 200 significant peaks p < 0.05 were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase the majority of peaks 42 were up-regulated in prrsv-positive piglets while 5 were down-regulated a panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 ph = 9 on the surface cm10 and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between prrsv-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73% respectively conclusions seldi-tof ms profiling of sera from prrsv-positive and prrsv-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of prrsv infection in weaning piglets furthermore seldi-tof protein markers represent a refined phenotype of prrsv infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies
the vast majority of human pathogens colonize and invade at the mucosal surfaces preventing infection at these sites via mucosally active vaccines is a promising and rational approach for vaccine development however it is only recently that the stimulation of local immunity at the mucosal surfaces has become a primary objective in addition to inducing systemic immunity this review describes vaccine formulations designed for mucosal delivery to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue via intranasal administration the association of antigens with mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems is emphasised
canine parvovirus cpv is the etiological agent of a severe viral disease of dogs after its emergence in late 1970s the cpv original type cpv-2 was rapidly and totally replaced by three antigenic variants named cpv-2a cpv-2b and cpv-2c cpv has an evolutionary rate nearest to those of rna viruses with consequences on disease diagnosis and epidemiology this paper reports the molecular characterization of eight cpv-2a strains collected from dogs in italy in 2016-2017 genetic analysis was conducted on a cpv genomic region encompassing both open reading frames orfs encoding for nonstructural ns1-ns2 and structural proteins vp1-vp2 sequence analysis indicates new and unreported sequence changes mainly affecting the vp2 gene which included the mutation tyr324leu this study represents the first evidence of a new cpv-2a mutant vp2 324leu and illustrates the importance of a continuous molecular survey in order to obtain more information on effective spread of new cpv mutants

background the intention of the following study was to describe the interrelationship between villagers domestic animals and wildlife at the community forestry concession of uaxactún guatemala by means of participatory epidemiological methods the main focus was generating information regarding different livestock diseases considered important by villagers and their relevance as well as obtaining knowledge concerning hunting activities and cooking methods to gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of people and animals and the diseases of their animals for poultry an overall prevalence of 41 % of newcastle disease was found by means of the elisa test by antibody detection chicken being the most affected species in the village no samples were positive to avian influenza with the hi test no virus was isolated by means of the tracheal or cloaca swabbing of ducks for hunting all species could be hunted by chance at any time of the year there was a difference in species hunted between seasons peccaries being more frequently hunted during the dry season and in contrast deer and wild avian during the rainy season for cooking villagers did not consume any raw meat the cooking methods depended on the species stewing was the most favoured method for peccaries wild birds tepezcuintle and domestic poultry whereas grilling was preferable for deer roasting for armadillos and marinating for pork according to the generated information the most important domestic livestock species in the village are chickens and pigs chickens being the most affected by diseases no evident health problems on pigs were observed in this study hunting was shown as an activity enhanced by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities in the village and was mostly directed at larger species such as deer and peccaries from the viewpoint of a transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans cooking methods mostly reflected a protective factor as no raw meat was eaten stews and broths being the most common forms of cooking involving an exposure of meat to high temperatures nonetheless both agricultural and hunting activities represent a risk factor for the spread of diseases as hunters may act as mechanical vectors for different pathogens within domestic and wild animal populations
humans who experience a primary dengue virus denv infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection affected individuals also generate cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous denv serotypes which are non-neutralizing dengue cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection of fc receptor bearing cells and potentially exacerbate disease the actual binding sites of human antibody on the denv particle are not well defined we characterized the specificity and neutralization potency of polyclonal serum antibodies and memory b-cell derived monoclonal antibodies hmabs from 2 individuals exposed to primary denv infections most denv-specific hmabs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing moreover many hmabs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble recombinant antigen re protein nonetheless by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to re we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of denv our mabs results indicate that in these two individuals exposed to primary denv infections a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization
in vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against rift valley fever virus rvfv infection we have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia ankara mva encoding rvfv glycoproteins rmvagngc was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal rvfv challenge protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific cd8+ cells with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies in this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after mva vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy thus we tested the efficacy and immune responses in balb/c mice of recombinant mva viruses expressing either glycoprotein gn rmvagn or gc rmvagc in the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the rvfv challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against gc epitopes the involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent furthermore our data suggest that the rmva based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rmvagngc or rmvagn immune serum thus gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in balb/c mice contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response
background in malaria-endemic areas human populations are frequently exposed to immunomodulatory salivary components injected during mosquito blood feeding the consequences on pathogen-specific immune responses are not well known this study evaluated and compared the humoral responses specific to merozoite stage vaccine candidates of plasmodium falciparum in children differentially exposed to anopheles bites in a natural setting the cross-sectional study was carried out in bouaké côte d'ivoire where entomological data and blood samples from children 0-14 years were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence antibody igg igg1 igg3 responses to pfama1 and pfmsp1 were evaluated by elisa univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to p falciparum antigens and exposure to anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site separately the individual level of exposure to anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific igg response to the anopheles gsg6-p1 salivary peptide which represents a proxy of anopheles exposure
• many parasites appear to exhibit host specificity • many parasites are also efficient in cross-species transmissions.• the above two phenomenon are largely incompatible without adaptive mutations • superinfection facilitates apparent host specificity and cross-species transmission a b s t r a c t parasites are either dedicated to a narrow host range or capable of exploiting a wide host range understanding how host ranges are determined is very important for public health as well as wildlife plant livestock and agricultural diseases our current understanding of host-parasite associations hinges on co-evolution which assumes evolved host preferences host specialization of the parasite despite the explanatory power of this framework we have only a vague understanding of why many parasites routinely cross the host species' barrier here we introduce a simple model demonstrating how superinfection in a heterogeneous community can promote host-parasite association strikingly the model illustrates that strong host-parasite association occurs in the absence of host specialization while still permitting cross-species transmission for decades host specialization has been foundational in explaining the maintenance of distinct parasites/strains in host species we argue that host specializations may be exaggerated and can occur as a byproduct not necessarily the cause of host-parasite associations
the emergence of new pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and ebola virus poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for novel antiviral approaches monoclonal antibodies mabs have been successfully used to treat various diseases particularly cancer and immunological disorders antigen-specific mabs have been isolated using several different approaches including hybridoma transgenic mice phage display yeast display and single b-cell isolation consequently an increasing number of mabs which exhibit high potency against emerging viruses in vitro and in animal models of infection have been developed in this paper we summarize historical trends and recent developments in mab discovery compare the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to mab production and discuss the potential use of such strategies for the development of antivirals against emerging diseases we also review the application of recently developed human mabs against sars-cov mers-cov and ebola virus and discuss prospects for the development of mabs as therapeutic agents against emerging viral diseases
bats are reservoir hosts of several high-impact viruses that cause significant human diseases including nipah virus marburg virus and rabies virus they also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts including sars and mers coronaviruses as is usual with reservoir hosts these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections a lack of reagents methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work these challenges can be addressed in part with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock
human coronavirus strain 229e hcov-229e and human alphaherpesvirus 1 were isolated from the plasma of a haitian child in 2016 with suspected arbovirus diseases to our knowledge this is the first description of hcov-229e in human plasma which is the focus of this article
the antiquated system used to manufacture the currently licensed inactivated influenza virus vaccines would not be adequate during an influenza virus pandemic there is currently a search for vaccines that can be developed faster and provide superior long-lasting immunity to influenza virus as well as other highly pathogenic viruses and bacteria recombinant vectors provide a safe and effective method to elicit a strong immune response to a foreign protein or epitope this review explores the advantages and limitations of several different vectors that are currently being tested and highlights some of the newer viruses being used as recombinant vectors
infectious bronchitis virus ibv poses a major threat to the chicken industry worldwide in this study we developed a recombinant fowlpox virus rfpv vaccine expressing the ibv s1 gene and chicken interleukin-18 gene il-18 rfpv-s1/il18 recombinant plasmid psy-s1/il18 was constructed by cloning chicken il-18 into fowlpox virus transfer plasmid containing s1 gene and transfected into the chicken embryo fibroblasts cell pre-infected with s-fpv-017 to generate rfpv-s1/il18 expression of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by rt-pcr and ifa we also constructed the recombinant fowlpox virus rfpv-s1 without il-18 one-day-old chickens were vaccinated by wing-web puncture with the two rfpvs and the induced humoral and cellular responses were evaluated there was a significant difference in elisa antibody levels p < 0.05 elicited by either rfpv-s1 or rfpv-s1/il18 the ratios of cd4 + to cd8 + in chickens immunized with rfpv-s1/il18 were significantly higher p < 0.05 than in those immunized with rfpv-s1 all chickens immunized with rfpv-s1/il18 were completely protected 20/20 after challenge with the virulent ibv hn99 strain 43 days after immunization while only 15 out of 20 of the chickens immunized with the rfpv-s1 were protected our results show that the protective efficacy of the rfpv-s1 vaccine could be enhanced significantly by simultaneous expression of il-18

zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans if so then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods these were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans virologists ecologists and computational biologists from academia federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts vectors and reservoirs this workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal h3n2 and pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps to answer the question of where to look prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife bats rodents arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed finally opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps taken together these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps
a ferret model of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov infection was used to evaluate the efficacy of an adenovirus vaccine animals were subjected to heterologous prime-boost using vectors from human serotype 5 and chimpanzee derived adenoviruses human adhu5 and chimpanzee adc7 expressing spike protein followed by intranasal challenge with sars-cov vaccination led to a substantial reduction in viral load and prevented the severe pneumonia seen in unvaccinated animals the same prime-boost strategy was effective in rhesus macaques in eliciting sars-cov specific immune responses these data indicate that a heterologous adenovirus-based prime-boost vaccine strategy could safely stimulate strong immunity that may be needed for complete protection against sars-cov infection
the aim of this study was to identify the receptors for prrsv on porcine alveolar macrophages pams by producing monoclonal antibodies mabs against these cells hybridoma supernatants were selected for their ability to block prrsv infection four mabs 1-8d2 9.4c7 9.9f2 and 3-3h2 inhibited infection and recognised cell surface pam-specific antigens as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay these mabs were then used to identify cellular proteins involved in prrsv infection by radioimmunoprecipitation assays ripas mabs 1-8d2 and 9.9f2 each recognised a 150 kda-polypeptide doublet while mabs 9.4c7 and 3-3h2 both recognised a 220 kda-polypeptide glycosidase treatment demonstrated all these polypeptides to be n-glycosylated thus multiple glycoproteins appear to be involved in infection of pams by prrsv * porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus prrsv is an enveloped positive stranded rna virus and a member of the arteriviridae family other members of this family are equine arteritis virus eav lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus ldv and simian haemorrhagic fever virus shfv . prrsv has a highly restricted tropism for macrophages particularly for porcine alveolar macrophages pams both in vivo and in vitro . recently prrsv was also shown to replicate in testicular germ cells . the only non-porcine cells known to support prrsv replication are the african green monkey kidney
background bat trypanosomes have been implicated in the evolutionary history of the t cruzi clade which comprises species from a wide geographic and host range in south america africa and europe including bat-restricted species and the generalist agents of human american trypanosomosis t cruzi and t rangeli methods trypanosomes from bats rhinolophus landeri and hipposideros caffer captured in mozambique southeast africa were isolated by hemoculture barcoding was carried out through the v7v8 region of small subunit ssu rrna and fluorescent fragment length barcoding fflb phylogenetic inferences were based on ssu rrna glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ggapdh and spliced leader sl genes morphological characterization included light scanning and transmission electron microscopy results new trypanosomes from bats clustered together forming a clade basal to a larger assemblage called the t cruzi clade barcoding phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances based on ssu rrna and ggapdh supported these trypanosomes as a new species which we named trypanosoma livingstonei n sp the large and highly polymorphic sl gene repeats of this species showed a copy of the 5s ribosomal rna into the intergenic region unique morphological large and broad blood trypomastigotes compatible to species of the subgenus megatrypanum and cultures showing highly pleomorphic epimastigotes and long and slender trypomastigotes and ultrastructural cytostome and reservosomes features and growth behaviour when co-cultivated with hela cells at 37°c differentiated into trypomastigotes resembling the blood forms and do not invaded the cells complemented the description of this species conclusion phylogenetic inferences supported the hypothesis that trypanosoma livingstonei n sp diverged from a common ancestral bat trypanosome that evolved exclusively in chiroptera or switched at independent opportunities to mammals of several orders forming the clade t cruzi hence providing further support for the bat seeding hypothesis to explain the origin of t cruzi and t rangeli
the immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex mhc are classical examples for high levels of genetic diversity and non-neutral evolution this is particularly true for the regions containing the antigen-binding sites as for instance in the exon 2 of the mhc class ii gene drb we surveyed for the first time in the order chiroptera the genetic diversity within this exon in the sac-winged bat saccopteryx bilineata we detected 11 alleles among 85 bats of which 79 were sampled in one population pairwise comparisons revealed that interallelic sequence differences ranged between 3 and 22% although nucleotide substitutions were not evenly distributed along the exon sequence this was most probably the result of intragenic recombination high levels of sequence divergence and significantly more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions d n /d s 41 suggest long-term balancing selection thus the data are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination gives rise to new alleles at the drb locus of the sac-winged bat and these are maintained in the population through balancing selection in this respect the sac-winged bat closely resembles other mammalian species
in chinese meishan/german landrace cross-bred swine f 2 generation interferon gamma ifn-g production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc was determined directly ex vivo at different time points after survival of a virulent pseudorabies virus prv infection this reactivity was compared with the reactivity of naïve pbmc significant ifn-g production was determined in elisa and elispot only after in vitro pbmc re-stimulation with prv and not with the closely related bovine herpesvirus bhv-1 the prv-specific ifn-g secretion from re-stimulated pbmc showed high levels 6 days after infection before the presence of serum antibodies and it persisted at a high level over a 3 months period the response of a group of eight piglets infected intranasally with prv varied only two animals showed the expected typical fever response prv specific ifn-g production by pbmc clearly indicated that infection had occurred early significant ifn-g production by primed pbmc turned out to be a reliable and specific ex vivo marker for cellular response against productive prv infection in swine before antibody formation #
this review focuses on reports of hepatitis e virus hantavirus rotavirus coronavirus and arenavirus in synanthropic rodents rattus rattus rattus norvegicus and mus musculus within urban environments despite their potential impact on human health relatively few studies have addressed the monitoring of these viruses in rodents comprehensive control and preventive activities should include actions such as the elimination or reduction of rat and mouse populations sanitary education reduction of shelters for the animals and restriction of the access of rodents to residences water and food supplies
background diarrhea in piglets directly affects commercial swine production the disease results from the interaction of pathogens with the host immune system and is also affected by management procedures several pathogenic agents such as campylobacter spp clostridium perfringens escherichia coli salmonella spp group a rotavirus rv-a coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus as well as nematode and protozoan parasites can be associated with disease cases results all bacterial viral protozoan and parasitic agents here investigated with the exception of salmonella spp as well as both coronaviruses were detected in varying proportions in piglet fecal samples and positive animals were equally distributed between case and control groups a statistically significant difference between case and control groups was found only for cystoisospora suis p = 0.034 and eimeria spp p = 0.047 when co-infections were evaluated a statistically significant difference was found only for c perfringens β2 and c suis p = 0.014 the presence of pathogens in piglets alone does not determine the occurrence of diarrhea episodes thus the indiscriminate use of antibiotic and anthelminthic medication should be re-evaluated this study also reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis and correct interpretation of results as well as the relevance of control and prophylactic measures
background the pig faecal virome which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces is complex and consists of pig viruses bacteriophages transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species only little is known about factors influencing its general composition here the effect of the probiotic bacterium enterococcus faecium e faecium ncimb 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets which received either the probiotic bacterium or not results from 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial dna and rna virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled next generation sequencing resulting in 390650 sequence reads in average 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses the percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest 55-77% in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest 8-10% in the samples of the sows in contrast the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows the dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets kobuvirus 54 day-old piglets boca- dependo-and pig stool-associated small circular dna virus and the sows pigscv circovirus and ''circovirus-like'' viruses cb-a and rw-a in addition the shannon index which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets no consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group conclusion the analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium e faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method
the present study was to characterize turkey coronavirus associated with turkey poult enteritis and mortality intestinal contents or intestines from affected turkey poults and inoculated turkey embryos contained coronaviruses as revealed by electron microscopy or were positive for turkey coronavirus by immunofluorescent antibody assay sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of the virus-containing intestinal homogenate yielded two opalescent bands corresponding to the buoyant densities of 1.14-1.15 and 1.18-1.20 g/ml respectively coronaviral particles from intestinal contents or the sucrose density gradient preparation were mainly spherical in shape and had envelope and central depression they were surrounded by a fringe of regularly spaced petal-shaped projections attached to the particles by a short stalk purified viruses hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 16 major protein bands of purified viruses analyzed by sds-page were located at 200 100-110 50-60 and 30-35 kda the patterns of protein bands were consistent with those of minnesota or quebec turkey coronavirus isolates a 568 bp nucleotide fragment of turkey coronavirus spike protein gene was amplified from rna of inoculated turkey embryo intestine or purified virus sequence analysis of the 568 bp pcr product revealed high degree of identity with the corresponding spike protein gene sequence of human and bovine coronaviruses the results indicated that turkey coronavirus was associated with turkey poults with acute enteritis #
canine non-rabies combined vaccines are widely used to protect animals from infectious agents and also play an important role in public health we performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events vaaes including anaphylaxis in japan by distributing questionnaires on vaaes to veterinary hospitals from april 1 2006 through may 31 2007 valid responses were obtained for 57300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals we obtained vaaes information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital we found that of the 57300 359 dogs showed vaaes of the 359 dogs death was observed in 1 anaphylaxis in 41 dermatological signs in 244 gastrointestinal signs in 160 and other signs in 106 onset of vaaes was mostly observed within 12 h after vaccination n = 299 83.3%. in this study anaphylaxis events occurred within 60 min after vaccination and about half of these events occurred within 5 min n = 19 46.3%. furthermore where anaphylaxis was reported additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs 27 of these demonstrated collapse 87.1% 24 demonstrated cyanosis 77.4% and both signs occurred in 22 71.0%. higher rates of animal vaaes anaphylaxis and death were found in japan than in other countries further investigations including survey studies will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for vaaes and thus develop safer vaccines moreover it may also be necessary to continually update the data of vaaes
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a newly identified virus that causes watery diarrhea in newborn piglets and results in significant economic losses to the pig industry since first reported in hong kong in 2012 pdcov has been subsequently detected in usa south korea thailand and mainland china here we isolated a strain of pdcov named chn-gd-2016 from the intestinal content of a diseased newborn piglet with severe diarrhea in a pig farm in guangdong china pdcov chn-gd-2016 could be identified by immunofluorescence with pdcov specific rabbit antisera and typical crown-shaped particles with spiky surface projections of this pdcov were observed with electron microscopy genomic analysis showed that the pdcov chn-gd-2016 was closely related to other chinese pdcov strains with the highest sequence similarity with the strain chn/tianjin/2016 importantly inoculation of newborn piglets with 1 9 10 5 tcid 50 of chn-gd-2016 by oral feeding successfully reproduced clear clinical symptoms including vomiting dehydration and severe diarrhea in piglets in addition the virus rna in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation was detected macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed and viral antigen was also detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining collectively the data show in this study confirms that pdcov is present in guangdong china and is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets
we established a source animal barrier facility saf for generating designated pathogen-free dpf pigs to serve as donors of viable organs tissues or cells for xenotransplantation into clinical patients this facility was populated with caesarian derived colostrum deprived cdcd piglets from sows of conventionalspecific or specified pathogen-free spf health status in six cohorts over a 10-month period in all cases cdcd piglets fulfilled dpf status including negativity for porcine circovirus pcv a particularly environmentally robust and difficult to inactivate virus which at the time of saf population was epidemic in the us commercial swine production industry two outbreaks of pcv infection were subsequently detected during sentinel testing the first occurred several weeks after pcv-negative animals were moved under quarantine from the nursery into an animal holding room the apparent origin of pcv was newly installed stainless steel penning which was not sufficiently degreased thereby protecting viral particles from disinfection the second outbreak was apparently transmitted via employee activities in the caesarian-section suite adjacent to the barrier facility in both cases pcv was contained in the animal holding room where it was diagnosed making a complete facility depopulation-repopulation unnecessary method infectious pcv was eliminated during both outbreaks by the following euthanizing infected animals disposing of all removable items from the affected animal holding room extensive cleaning with detergents and degreasing agents sterilization of equipment and rooms with chlorine dioxide vaporized hydrogen peroxide and potassium peroxymonosulfate and for the second outbreak also glutaraldehyde/ quaternary ammonium impact on other barrier animals throughout the process was monitored by frequent pcv diagnostic testing after close monitoring for 6 months indicating pcv absence from all rooms and animals herd animals were removed from quarantine status
to determine if a hypersensitive-type lung pathology might occur when mice were given an inactivated mers-cov vaccine and challenged with infectious virus as was seen with sars-cov vaccines we prepared and vaccinated mice with an inactivated mers-cov vaccine neutralizing antibody was induced by vaccine with and without adjuvant and lung virus was reduced in vaccinated mice after challenge lung mononuclear infiltrates occurred in all groups after virus challenge but with increased infiltrates that contained eosinophils and increases in the eosinophil promoting il-5 and il-13 cytokines only in the vaccine groups inactivated mers-cov vaccine appears to carry a hypersensitive-type lung pathology risk from mers-cov infection that is similar to that found with inactivated sars-cov vaccines from sars-cov infection
one of the most important anthropic missions is preventing the global spread of infectious diseases vaccination is the only available preventive treatment for infectious diseases but the availability of vaccines in developing countries is not adequate we report a simple easy-to-use noninvasive hydrogel patch transcutaneous vaccination system antigen ag-specific igg production was induced by applying an agimmersed patch to non-pretreated mouse auricle or hairless rat back skin immunofluorescence histochemical analysis revealed that langerhans cells resident in the epidermal layer captured the antigenic proteins delivered by the hydrogel patch which promoted the penetration of antigenic proteins through the stratum corneum and that ag-capturing langerhans cells migrated into draining lymph nodes humoral immunity elicited by our transcutaneous vaccination system demonstrated neutralizing activity in both adenoviral infection and passive-challenge tetanus toxin experiments the use of this hydrogel patch transcutaneous vaccination system will facilitate the global distribution of effective and convenient vaccines
isotype-capture elisas for bcv-speci®c iga and igm were developed and tested on milk and serum samples from swedish cattle the capture elisas showed higher sensitivity than indirect elisas for detection of bcv-speci®c iga and igm in the capture elisas the agreement between detection in milk and serum samples was 94% for iga and 86% for igm the correlation between log 10 titres in milk and serum was r0.82 p<0.001 for iga and 0.84 p<0.001 for igm milk seemed a better target than serum for diagnosing speci®c iga at low levels there was no variation in the isotype-speci®c bcv antibody titres between healthy quarters of the same udder but subclinical mastitis was associated with higher levels of iga antibodies and weak false igm positive reactions in undiluted milk bovine iga and igm antibodies in milk and serum showed high stability towards freezing and thawing and storage at room temperature the antibody responses to bcv were followed in milk and serum from six dairy cows and in serum from four calves for a period of 1 year after an outbreak of winter dysentery wd in this outbreak some animals became reinfected with bcv the iga and igm capture elisas differentiated between primarily bcv infected and reinfected animals in the primarily infected cattle igm antibodies were ®rst detected in milk and serum four to nine days after the ®rst wd veterinary microbiology 72 2000 183±206 s 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 9 9 0 0 2 0 8 -4 symptoms observed and were subsequently detected for at least 2±3 weeks igm was also detected in the reinfected cows but mostly at lower levels and for a shorter period of time than in the primarily infected animals in milk however the igm response of the reinfected cows was detected for a longer period of time than in serum six months after the outbreak iga was still detected in both serum and milk of all six cows and also in serum of one calf the reinfected cows showed higher and more long-lasting peak levels of iga in milk and serum than the primarily infected cows indicating boosting of the iga response #
zoonoses are a worldwide public health concern accounting for approximately 75% of human infectious diseases in addition zoonoses adversely affect agricultural production and wildlife we review some mathematical models developed for the study of viral zoonoses in wildlife and identify areas where further modeling efforts are needed
background neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial condition commonly present on pig farms and leads to economic losses due to increased morbidity and mortality of piglets immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens the microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are rotavirus a coronavirus enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec clostridium perfringens type c cryptosporidium spp giardia spp cystoisospora suis and strongyloides ransomi however in recent years the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens the primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of e coli enterococcus spp c perfringens and c difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens furthermore an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated results the prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for e coli c perfringens and c difficile was similar in both groups of piglets however enterococcus spp was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets furthermore adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets these bacteria were identified as e coli and enterococcus spp and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes the results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-etec e coli and enterococcus spp can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea these bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets when detection of common well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful
equine coronavirus ecov is considered an emerging enteric virus with reported morbidity rates ranging from 10 to 83% and fatality rates ranging from 7 to 27% in adult horses a vaccine for ecov is currently not available this study investigated the safety humoral response and viral shedding in horses inoculated with a commercially available modified-live bovine coronavirus bcov vaccine twelve healthy adult horses were vaccinated twice 3 weeks apart either orally intranasally or intrarectally two healthy unvaccinated horses served as sentinel controls following each vaccine administration horses were monitored daily for physical abnormalities whilst the onset and duration of bcov shedding was determined by quantitative pcr qpcr in nasal secretions and faeces whole blood was collected every 3 weeks to determine bcov-specific antibody response with the exception of transient and self-limiting changes in faecal character observed in seven vaccinated and one control horse no additional abnormal clinical findings were found in the study horses following the first and second vaccine administration two and one horse respectively tested qpcrpositive for bcov in nasal secretions 1-day post intranasal vaccination no vaccinated horses tested qpcr-positive for bcov in faeces following each vaccine administration one of the two horses that shed bcov seroconverted to bcov after the first vaccine administration and an additional two vaccinated horses oral and intrarectal seroconverted to bcov after the second vaccine administration in conclusion the results show that the modified-live bcov is safe to administer to horses via various routes causes minimal virus shedding and results in detectable antibodies to bcov in 27% of the vaccinates
we have shown previously that replacement of the spike s gene of the apathogenic ibv strain beau-r with that from the pathogenic strain of the same serotype m41 resulted in an apathogenic virus beaur-m41s that conferred protection against challenge with m41 . we have constructed a recombinant ibv beaur-4/91s with the genetic backbone of beau-r but expressing the spike protein of the pathogenic ibv strain 4/91uk which belongs to a different serogroup as beaudette or m41 similar to our previous findings with beaur-m41s clinical signs observations showed that the s gene of the pathogenic 4/91 virus did not confer pathogenicity to the ribv beaur-4/91s furthermore protection studies showed there was homologous protection beaur-4/91s conferred protection against challenge with wild type 4/91 virus as shown by the absence of clinical signs ibv rna assessed by qrt-pcr and the fact that no virus was isolated from tracheas removed from birds primarily infected with beaur-4/91s and challenged with ibv 4/91uk a degree of heterologous protection against m41 challenge was observed albeit at a lower level our results confirm and extend our previous findings and conclusions that swapping of the ectodomain of the s protein is a precise and effective way of generating genetically defined candidate ibv vaccines
avian infl uenza virus h5n1 can be transmitted to humans resulting in a severe or fatal disease the aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian infl uenza h5n1 strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal infl uenza a h1n1/h3n2 a small frequency of cd4 t cells specifi c for subtype h5n1 was detected in several persons at baseline and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive cd4 t cells we also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against infl uenza h5n1 in a large number of donors no correlation between infl uenzaspecifi c cd4 t cells and humoral responses was observed n1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point these fi ndings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza a virus subtype h5n1 by seasonal infl uenza vaccination

about 30 ~ of weanling rats inoculated with jhm virus developed a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis sde 3 weeks after inoculation a i from the remaining animals 5~ displayed overt neurological signs 3 6 and 8 months a i animals with and without clinical signs 6-8 months a i were morphologically examined fresh demyelinating lesions could be demonstrated in paralyzed animals viral antigen was demonstrated and infectious jhm virus could be recovered from one animal which developed clinical signs at 3 months a i in one animal with clinical onset of 8 months a i completely remyelinated areas as well as recent demyelinating lesions were observed suggesting a recurrence of the disease process remyelinated areas were also found in 40 ~ of clinically silent animals the morphology of the late onset of the demyelination was similar to that occurring in sde remyelination consisted of both cns and pns-type this animal model offers the possibility to investigate the virus-host relationship which is responsible for the induction of a demyelinating process after a long incubation period
filovirdae that causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate as high as 90%. avi-7288 a positively charged antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer pmoplus targeting the viral nucleoprotein gene was evaluated as a potential therapeutic intervention for marv infection following delayed treatment of 1 24 48 and 96 h post-infection pi in a nonhuman primate lethal challenge model a total of 30 cynomolgus macaques were divided into 5 groups of 6 and infected with 1830 plaque forming units of marv subcutaneously avi-7288 was administered by bolus infusion daily for 14 days at 15 mg/kg body weight survival was the primary endpoint of the study while none 0 of 6 of the saline group survived 83-100% of infected monkeys survived when treatment was initiated 1 24 48 or 96 h post-infection pi the antisense treatment also reduced serum viremia and inflammatory cytokines in all treatment groups compared to vehicle controls the antibody immune response to virus was preserved and tissue viral antigen was cleared in avi-7288 treated animals these data show that avi-7288 protects nhps against an otherwise lethal marv infection when treatment is initiated up to 96 h pi marburg virus marv is a filovirus closely related to ebola virus and similarly causes hemorrhagic fever in humans marv is endemic throughout parts of tropical africa severe outbreaks of marburg virus disease mvd have occurred involving hundreds of plos neglected tropical diseases |
hepatitis c virus infects approximately 1% of the world's population and no vaccine is currently available due to the high variability of hcv and its ability to actively escape the immune response a goal of hcv vaccine design is to induce neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes here we performed structure-based design of several epitopes of the hcv e2 envelope glycoprotein to engineer its antigenic properties designs were tested in vitro and in vivo demonstrating alteration of the e2 antigenic profile in several cases and one design led to improvement of cross-neutralization of heterologous viruses this represents a proof of concept that rational engineering of hcv envelope glycoproteins can be used to modulate e2 antigenicity and optimize a vaccine for this challenging viral target
zoonotic pathogens are significant burdens on global public health because they are transmitted to humans from non-human animals the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors the 'dilution effect' proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity however the meta-analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors and their ecology rather than patterns of species biodiversity
currently under evaluation as a human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 vaccine vector the most compelling reasons to develop rvsv as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture numerous preclinical studies with rvsv vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility flexibility and potential efficacy of the rvsv vaccine platform when administered to nonhuman primates nhps rvsv vectors expressing hiv-1 gag and env elicited robust hiv-1specific cellular and humoral immune responses and animals immunized with rvsv vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus siv gag and hiv env were protected from aids after challenge with a pathogenic siv/hiv recombinant however results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in nhps indicated that these prototypic rvsv vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations to address this safety concern a variety of different attenuation strategies designed to produce a range of further attenuated rvsv vectors are currently under investigation additional modifications of further attenuated rvsv vectors to upregulate expression of hiv-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation
hendra virus causes sporadic but typically fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern australia fruit-bats of the genus pteropus commonly known as flying-foxes are the natural host of the virus and the putative source of infection in horses infected horses are the source of human infection effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy this study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported hendra virus infection in horses spatial autocorrelation global moran's i showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km a distance consistent with the foraging 'footprint' of a flying-fox roost suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering getis-ord gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern australia coast from far north queensland to central new south wales with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern queensland to northern new south wales geographically weighted regression gwr showed the density of p alecto and p conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of hendra virus for horses than p poliocephalus or p scapulatus the density of horses climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors but the residuals from the gwr suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors
how to cite this article ismail zm el-deeb ah el-safty mm hussein ha 2018 enhanced pathogenicity of low-pathogenic h9n2 avian influenza virus after vaccination with infectious bronchitis live attenuated vaccine veterinary world 11 7 977-985 aim in the present study two experiments were carried out for studying the pathogenicity of h9n2 avian influenza virus aiv in broiler chickens after vaccination with different live respiratory viral vaccines one-day-old specific pathogen-free spf chicks were divided into four groups in each experiment in experiment 1 groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with h9n2 aiv through nasal route in 1 day old groups 1 and 3 were vaccinated with live infectious bronchitis coronavirus ibv vaccine in 5 days old and group 4 was left as a negative control in experiment 2 groups 5 and 6 were inoculated with aiv subtype h9n2 through nasal route in 1 day old group 5 was vaccinated with live ibv vaccine and live newcastle disease virus ndv vaccine in 5 and 18 days old respectively groups 6 and 7 were vaccinated with live ndv vaccine in 18 days old and group 8 was left as a negative control chicks were kept in isolators for 18 days in the first experiment and 35 days in the second experiment tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from 3 5 7 10 12 and 15 day's old chicks from all groups in experiment 1 and 21 23 25 and 28 days old from all groups in experiment 2 quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr was applied on the collected tracheal swabs for detecting rna copies of h9n2 aiv cloacal swabs and the positive rrt-pcr tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old spf embryonated chicken eggs ece to confirm rrt-pcr results internal organs kidney trachea and spleen from all chicken groups were collected weekly for histopathological examination to determine severity of the lesions serum samples were collected on a weekly basis for the detection of humoral immune response against h9n2 ndv and ibv from all chicken groups results rrt-pcr results with virus titration in eces revealed a significant increase in h9n2 aiv titer with extension in the period of viral shedding in groups 1 and 5 severe lesion score was observed for groups 1 and 5 the humoral immune response against h9n2 aiv ndv and ibv revealed a significant increase in h9n2 aiv titer in groups 1 and 5 ndv titer showed a significant increase in group 7 and ibv titer increased in groups 1 3 and 5 results demonstrated the increase in pathogenicity of h9n2 aiv especially when h9n2-infected chicks vaccinated with live ibv vaccine
porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov also known as porcine coronavirus hku15 was first detected in north america in early 2014 and associated with enteric disease in pigs resulting in an urgent need to further investigate the ecology of this virus while assays detecting nucleic acids were implemented quickly assays to detect anti-pdcov antibodies have not been available in this study an indirect anti-pdcov igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa based on the putative s1 portion of the spike protein was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-pdcov igg in u s pigs the diagnostic sensitivity of the pdcov elisa was 91% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%. a total of 968 serum samples were tested including samples with confirmed infection with pdcov porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus there was no cross-reactivity with any of the other coronaviruses among 355 arbitrarily selected serum samples collected in 2014 and originating from 51 farms across 18 u s states anti-pdcov igg antibodies were detected in 8.7% of the samples and in 25.5% of the farms whereas anti-pedv igg was detected in 22.8% of the samples and in 54.9% of the farms in addition anti-pdcov igg antibodies were detected in archived samples collected in 2010 perhaps indicating an earlier undetected introduction into the u s pig population overall the obtained data suggest that pdcov seroprevalence in u s pigs is lower compared to pedv and pdcov may have been introduced to the u s prior to pedv
european populations of free-living wildcats have been shown to be exposed to cat viruses luxembourg has a high degree of habitat fragmentation and hybridisation rates between domestic cats and wildcats are high we therefore assessed the seroprevalence of six viruses in 34 serum samples collected between 2001 and 2016 from wildcats in luxembourg the values for feline leukemia virus felv 52.9% and feline coronavirus fcov 47.1% were amongst the highest reported for wildcats we found evidence for the cumulative likelihood of exposure to fcov affecting its seroprevalence routine monitoring of viral agents in this strictly protected species should be considered
sars-cov infection of human results in antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses however it is critical to determine whether sars-cov-specific memory t cells can persist for long periods of time in this study we analyzed the cellular immune response from 21 sarsrecovered individuals who had been diagnosed with sars in 2003 by using elisa cba elispot and multiparameter flow cytometry assays our results demonstrated that low levels of specific memory t cell responses to sars-cov s m e and n peptides were detected in a correspondence to chang-you wu changyou_wu@yahoo com proportion of sars-recovered patients and ifn-γ was the predominant cytokine produced by t cells after stimulation with peptides cytometry analysis indicated that the majority of memory cd8 + t cells produced ifn-γ whereas memory cd4 + t cells produced ifn-γ il-2 or tnf-α these results might provide valuable information on the cellular immune response in recovered sars-cov patients for the rational design of vaccines against sars-cov infection fan et al
pigs are increasingly recognized to harbor a wide range of viruses that apparently establish long-term persistence in these animals they serve as reservoirs for a number of human zoonotic diseases in this study a porcine astrovirus pastv strain designated as pastv jwh-1
background rotavirus rv is a member of the reoviridae family and an important etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in the young rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals in this paper we report the first characterisation of a rv strain from a giraffe calf results this report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old giraffe giraffa camelopardalis presenting with acute diarrhea the rv strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as g10p . detailed sequence analysis of vp4 and vp7 revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to bovine rv borv this study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of rv strains in various animal populations which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported furthermore extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types
the existence of coronaviruses in bats is unknown until the recent discovery of bat-sars-cov in chinese horseshoe bats and a novel group 1 coronavirus in other bat species among 309 bats of 13 species captured from 20 different locations in rural areas of hong kong over a 16-month period coronaviruses were amplified from anal swabs of 37 12% bats by rt-pcr phylogenetic analysis of rna-dependent-rna-polymerase pol and helicase genes revealed six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species in addition to the two previously described coronaviruses among the six novel coronaviruses four were group 1 coronaviruses bat-cov hku2 from chinese horseshoe bat bat-cov hku6 from rickett's big-footed bat bat-cov hku7 from greater bent-winged bat and bat-cov hku8 from lesser bent-winged bat and two were group 2 coronaviruses bat-cov hku4 from lesser bamboo bats and bat-cov hku5 from japanese pipistrelles an astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was observed in bats
ferret and mink coronaviruses typically cause catarrhal diarrhea in ferrets and minks respectively in recent years however systemic fatal coronavirus infection has emerged in ferrets which resembles feline infectious peritonitis fip in cats fip is a highly fatal systemic disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus infection in cats despite the importance of coronavirus infections in these animals there are no effective commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these infections we have previously reported the efficacy of a protease inhibitor in cats with fip demonstrating that a virally encoded 3c-like protease 3clpro is a valid target for antiviral drug development for coronavirus infections in this study we extended our previous work on coronavirus inhibitors and investigated the structure-activity relationships of a focused library of protease inhibitors for ferret and mink 3clpro using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay we identified potent inhibitors broadly effective against feline ferret and mink coronavirus 3clpro multiple amino acid sequence analysis and modelling of 3clpro of ferret and mink coronaviruses were conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings the results of this study provide support for further research to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents for multiple coronavirus infections to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on small molecule inhibitors of ferret and mink coronaviruses
emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health throughout the world over the past decade west nile virus wnv dengue virus denv and chikungunya virus chikv have caused annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis hemorrhagic fever\shock syndromes and arthritis respectively currently no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines exist for use in humans to combat or prevent these viral infections thus there is a pressing need to define the virus-host interactions that govern immunity and infection outcome recent technological breakthroughs in 'omics' resources and high-throughput based assays are beginning to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and improve on current strategies for vaccine design in this review we highlight studies with wnv and discuss how traditional and systems based approaches are being used to rapidly identify novel host targets for therapeutic intervention and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the host response to virus infection
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the most common cause of respiratory infection in infants and no vaccine is available in this report recombinant aik-c measles vaccines expressing the rsv g or f protein of subgroup a mvaik/rsv/g or f were investigated as a rsv vaccine candidate mvaik/rsv/g or f had the original ts phenotype and expressed rsv/g or f protein cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against rsv subgroups a and b were detected in cotton rats immunized intramuscularly with mvaik/rsv/f but not mvaik/rsv/g in cotton rats infected with rsv rsv was recovered and lung histopathological finding was compatible with interstitial pneumonia demonstrating thickening of alveolar walls and infiltration of mononuclear cells when cotton rats immunized with mvaik/rsv/f were challenged with homologous rsv subgroup a no infectious rsv was recovered and very mild inflammation was noted without rsv antigen expression when they were challenged with subgroup b protective efficacy decreased when cotton rats immunized with mvaik/rsv/g were challenged with rsv subgroup a low levels of infectious virus were recovered from lung when challenged with subgroup b no protective effects was demonstrated demonstrating large amounts of rsv antigen in bronchial-epithelial cells mvaik/rsv/f is promising candidate and protective effects should be confirmed in monkey model
h9n2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus lpaiv is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines the disease still remains widespread we speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of h9n2 viruses in this study we constructed a novel lactococcus lactis l lactis strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the m1 and ha2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic h9n2 virus strain the m1-ha2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from l lactis by western blotting we assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant l lactis strain eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant l lactis strain fecal and intestinal samples sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7 14 and 21 days post-vaccination dpv chickens vaccinated with the recombinant l lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies t cell-mediated immune responses and mucosal secretory iga siga following challenge with h9n2 virus at 21 dpv chickens vaccinated with the recombinant l lactis strain showed decreased weight loss lower viral titers in the lung and reduced lung pathological damage in summary our results demonstrated that a recombinant l lactis strain expressing an h9n2 m1-ha2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity this oral vaccine is h9n2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control h9n2 virus infection
twenty-four volunteers at the common cold unit were divided into two groups of twelve one group was vaccinated orally with an enterovirus lev 4 and the other with nutrient broth both groups were challenged three days later with intranasal rhinovirus i and they were observed clinically and monitored by laboratory tests to see if any modification of the rhinovirus infection occurred all&he vaccinated volunteers were successfully infected with lev 4 and were excreting the enterovirus in the faeces at near maximum titres at the time of the rhinovirus infection following which 67 per cent of the volunteers were infected and 29 per cent developed symptoms however the vaccinated group did not differ from the unvaccinated in respect of the illness induced the excretion of rhinovirus type 4 or the rise of rv4 antibody titre lev4 was isolated from the nasopharynx of some of the volunteers but the rhinovirus infection was not modified even in these interferon was present in the serum and nasal washings of nine volunteers in all of whom only 3 had received the lev 4 vaccination two additional volunteers were shown to be insusceptible to reinfection with lev4 it was concluded that live enterovirus vaccination does not induce viral interference
in addition we observed protection in immunized mice challenged with mouse-adapted h9n2 aiv and h1n1 influenza virus as evidenced by reductions in the lung virus titers improvements in lung pathology and weight loss and complete survival our data are promising for the generation of effective non-traditional influenza vaccines against aivs
in this article we review important established newly emergent and potential viral diseases of cats dogs and rabbits topics covered include virus epidemiology disease pathogenesis existing and prospective immunoprophylaxis against the viruses for some feline viruses notably the immunodeficiency virus leukaemia virus and peritonitis virus available vaccines are poorly efficacious but there are good prospects for this a further challenge for the industry is likely to be due to viruses jumping species and the emergence of more virulent variants of established viruses resulting from mutations as has been the case for the canine parvovirus coronaviruses and feline calicivirus
minimm-disease md cats raised in a barrier-maintained feline breeding colony routinely become coronavirus cv antibody-positive at 5-8 weeks of age and remain seropositive indefinitely in addition they shed coronavirus-like particles cvlps in their feces which are morphologically distinct from "typical" coronaviruses 0ronasal intraperitoneal intraduodenal and intravenous inoculations of cvlps were uniformly unsuccessful in the seroconversion of eats to cv whereas subsequent prolonged close contact with colony eats did result in seroconversion such evidence indicates that md eats in this barrier colony are infected with at least two non-crossreactive agents 1 feline enteric cvlps which are shed in feces and are morphologically and antigenicmly distinct from established coronaviruses cvs and 2 a virus which is antigenically cross-reactive with cvs but which is apparently shed by some route other than the lower gastrointestinal tract
dromedary or one-humped camels camelus dromedarius are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk currently there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels with highest numbers in africa and the middle east the hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them especially as a stable protein source camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals the ability for camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species we conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications 65% focused on middle east respiratory syndrome mers brucellosis echinococcus granulosus and rift valley fever the high fatality from mers outbreaks during 2012-2016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of mers-related publications however we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as yersinia pestis coxiella burnetii and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts camel populations particularly in sub-saharan africa are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts and thus the risk of zoonoses increases as well in this review we provide an overview of the major zoonotic diseases present in dromedary camels their risk to humans and recommendations to minimize spillover events
five cryptosporidium-free canada geese branta canademis were individually orally dosed with 3.5 x to' cryptosporidium parvum oocysts infectious to neonatal balevc mice after intestinal passage inoculum-derived oocysts extracted from goose faeces established severe infection in 14 neonatal balb/c mice inoculum dose 2.5 x io'/mouse the inoculum-derived oocysts were detected in goose faeces up to 9 days post-inoculation pi the number of intact oocysts and oocyst shells shed during the first 3 days pi was significantly higher than for the remaining 6 days pi p<o or based on acid-fast stained air-dried direct wet smears 62% of the oocysts in goose faeces were intact oocyst shells constituted 3 8 % and conformed to morphological features of viable and infectious inoculum oocysts the fluorescence scores of the inoculated oocysts obtained by usc of the merifluor test were identical to those obtained for the faeces-recovered oocysts majority 3+ to 4 + . the dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that overall the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than oocyst shells p<o o i . retention of the viability and infectivity of c parvum oocysts following intestinal passage through a migratory water-fowl species has serious epidemiological implications water-fowl can serve as mechanical vectors for the water-borne oocysts and can containinate surface waters with c parvum as the concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts in source waters is attributable to water-shed management practices water-shed protection programme officials should consider water-fowl as a potential factor enhancing contamination of the source water with cryptosporidium
hantaviruses have previously been recognised to cause two separate syndromes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome hps in the americas however increasing evidence suggests that this dichotomy is no longer fruitful when recognising human hantavirus disease and understanding the pathogenesis herein are presented three cases of severe european puumala hantavirus infection that meet the hps case definition the clinical and pathological findings were similar to those found in american hantavirus patients consequently hantavirus infection should be considered as a cause of acute respiratory distress in all endemic areas worldwide
host antiviral genes are important regulators of antiviral immunity and plausible genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity after vaccination we genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagsnps from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine associations between snps/ haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in caucasians and african-americans genetic variants within the ddx58/rig-i gene including a coding polymorphism rs3205166/ val800val were associated as single-snps p≤0.017 although these snps did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/fdr and in haplotype-level analysis with measles-specific antibody variations in caucasians haplotype allele p-value=0.021 haplotype global p-value=0.076 four ddx58 polymorphisms in high ld demonstrated also associations after correction for fdr with variations in both measles-specific ifn-γ and il-2 secretion in caucasians p≤0.001 q=0.193 two intronic oas1 polymorphisms including the functional oas1 snp rs10774671 p=0.003 demonstrated evidence of association with a significant alleledose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in african-americans genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of adar genetic variants including a nonsynonymous snp rs2229857/arg384lys p=0.01 in regulating measles virus-specific ifn-γ elispot responses in caucasians haplotype global p-value=0.017 after correction fdr 15 single-snp associations 11 snps in caucasians and 4 snps in african-americans still remained significant at the q-value<0.20 in conclusion our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control as critical determinants differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in caucasians and african-americans dcorresponding q-values adjusting for fdr bolded snps are associated with an allele dose-related decrease in il-2 secretion levels only polymorphisms with p≤0.01 and q<0.2 are presented in the table
cohorts of pre-weaned calves were studied for cryptosporidium infection over three successive years 201020112012 in one beef cattle herd in western france each year 25-34 calves were sampled weekly from 3 days to one month of age in order to characterize oocyst output cryptosporidium species and clinical features associated with infection faecal samples were screened for the presence of oocysts using immunofluorescence analysis dna was extracted from positive samples and a pcr ssu rrna followed by rflp or sequencing was performed for the subtyping of c parvum a gp60 pcr was carried out regardless of the year 92-100% of the animals excreted oocysts on at least one sampling date depending on the year of observation the age of highest prevalence varied in contrast the peak of excretion was systematically observed almost at the same age 2nd-3rd week of life with excretion levels ranging from between 100 and 1.7 × 10 7 oocysts/g of faeces differences concerning clinical signs depending on the year of sampling were observed different species patterns were observed with a predominance of c bovis in the 1st year and a predominance of c parvum in the last year moreover two zoonotic subtypes of c parvum iiaa15g2r1 and iiaa18g2r1 were recorded in different years this study shows that in a given farm the cryptosporidium species and c parvum subtypes identified as well as the prevalence of infection and level of excretion may vary greatly and show distinct patterns according to the year
surveillance european bat lyssavirus rabies zoonoses conservation a b s t r a c t worldwide there are more than 1100 species of the order chiroptera 45 of which are present in europe and 16 in the uk bats are reservoirs of or can be infected by several viral diseases including rabies virus strains in the lyssavirus genus within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in europe european bat lyssavirus 1 eblv-1 european bat lyssavirus 2 eblv-2 and four currently unclassified isolates since 1977 783 cases of eblvs by isolation of viral rna have been recorded in europe eblv-1 or eblv-2 has been identified in 12 bat species with over 95% of eblv-1 infections identified in eptesicus serotinus eblv-2 is associated with myotis species myotis daubentonii and myotis dasycneme a programme of passive surveillance in the united kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses of these four m daubentonii 3.57% of submitted m daubentoniiwere positive for eblv-2 potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible overrepresentation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the uk in 2003 active surveillance in the uk began and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1-5% of eblv-2 in m daubentonii n = 350 and one bat with antibodies to eblv-1 in e serotinus n = 52 no cases of live lyssavirus infection or lyssavirus viral rna have been detected through active surveillance further research and monitoring regarding prevalence transmission pathogenesis and immunity is required to ensure that integrated bat conservation continues throughout europe whilst enabling informed policy decision regarding both human and wildlife health issues
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv has a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability the purpose of this study was to determine if porcine circovirus type 2 pcv2 infection increases genetic variability of prrsv during serial passages in pigs and to determine if there is a difference in the prrsv mutation rate between pigs concurrently infected with pcv2a or pcv2b after 8 consecutive passages of prrsv alone group 1 prrsv with pcv2a group 2 or pcv2b group 3 in pigs the sequences of prrsv structural genes for open reading frame orf 5 orf6 orf7 and the partial non-structural protein gene nsp 2 were determined the total number of identified amino acid mutations in orf5 orf6 orf7 and nsp2 sequences was 30 for prrsv infection only 63 for prrsv/pcv2a concurrent infection and 77 for prrsv/pcv2b concurrent infection when compared with the original vr2385 virus used to infect the passage 1 pigs compared to what occurred in pigs infected with prrsv only the mutation rates in orf5 and orf6 were significantly higher for concurrent prrsv/pcv2b infected pigs the prrsv/pcv2a pigs had a significantly higher mutation rate in orf7 the results from this study indicated that besides orf5 and nsp2 the prrsv structural genes orf6 and orf7 were shown to mutate at various degrees when the prrsv was passaged over time in vivo furthermore a significantly higher mutation rate of prrsv was observed when pigs were co-infected with pcv2 highlighting the importance of concurrent infections on prrsv evolution and control
twenty-two newborn puppies that did not receive colostrum exhibited acute respiratory signs and died at a breeding facility pathological examinations were performed on four of the puppies at necropsy examination the lungs were firm and mottled dark red consistent with acute bronchopneumonia histopathologically there was marked infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the bronchi and alveoli and gram-negative coccobacilli were attached diffusely to the cilia of bronchial mucosa immunohistochemistry for bordetella bronchiseptica antigen revealed positive labelling of the bacterial agents on electron microscopy a large number of coccobacilli were observed attaching to the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells real-time polymerase chain reaction amplified a b bronchiseptica gene from the affected lung tissue based on these findings the four puppies were diagnosed with fatal b bronchiseptica bronchopneumonia
genotype g9 is an emerging genotype among species a rotavirus rva circulating in humans and pigs worldwide in this study an rva strain designated rva/dog-tc/chn/sccd-a/2017/g9p was isolated in cell culture from a pet dog stool sample with acute diarrhea and its whole genome was sequenced the genotype constellation of sccd-a was g9-p-i5-r1-c1-m1-a8-n1-t1-e1-h1 all genome segments except the vp1 gene were closely related to the genes from porcine rva strains or porcine-like human rva strains on the other hand the vp1 gene clustered in a distinct lineage only with that of a g5p porcine-like human rva preventing the identification of the exact host species origin but very unlikely to be originated from human rva in addition phylogenetic analysis showed that the g9 vp7 gene of sccd-a clustered into a novel sublineage within the lineage iii of g9 this first isolation of a g9p rva from a pet dog may justify the exploration of the role dogs play in the interaction of rva circulating in pigs and humans
emerging viral diseases represent an ongoing challenge for globalized world and bats constitute an immense partially explored reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and as observed for human noroviruses they may impact on human health on a global scale by screening fecal samples of bats in hungary calicivirus rna was identified in the samples of myotis daubentonii and eptesicus serotinus bats in order to characterize more in detail the bat caliciviruses large portions of the genome sequence of the viruses were determined phylogenetic analyses and molecular modeling identified firmly the two viruses as candidate members within the caliciviridae family with one calicivirus strain resembling members of the sapovirus genus and the other bat calicivirus being more related to porcine caliciviruses of the proposed genus valovirus this data serves the effort for detecting reservoir hosts for potential emerging viruses and recognize important evolutionary relationships
the sars-cov spike glycoprotein s is the main target of the protective immune response in humans and animal models of sars here we demonstrated that efficient expression of s from the wild-type spike gene in cultured cells required the use of improved plasmid vectors containing donor and acceptor splice sites as well as heterologous viral rna export elements such as the cte of mazon-pfizer monkey virus or the pre of woodchuck hepatitis virus wpre the presence of both splice sites and wpre markedly improved the immunogenicity of s-based dna vaccines against sars upon immunization of mice with low doses 2 μg of naked dna only intron and wpre-containing vectors could induce neutralizing anti-s antibodies and provide protection against challenge with sars-cov our observations are likely to be useful for the construction of plasmid and viral vectors designed for optimal expression of intronless genes derived from cytoplasmic rna viruses
| surviving a single infection often results in lifelong immunity to the infecting pathogen such protection is mediated in large part by two main b cell memory 'walls' -namely longlived plasma cells and memory b cells the cellular and molecular processes that drive the production of long-lived plasma cells and memory b cells are subjects of intensive research and have important implications for global health indeed although nearly all vaccines in use today depend on their ability to induce b cell memory we have not yet succeeded in developing vaccines for some of the world's most deadly diseases including aids and malaria here we describe the two-phase process by which antigen drives the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory b cells and highlight the challenges for successful vaccine development in each phase
in march 2013 a patient infected with a novel avian influenza a h7n9 virus was reported in china since then there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths the virus contains several human-adapted markers indicating that h7n9 has pandemic potential the outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines previously we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain m2e of the h5n1 virus h5n1-m2e could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of h5n1 and 2009 pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses in this study we investigated the cross-protection of h5n1-m2e against lethal infection with the new h7n9 virus although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13 14 18 20 and 21 between m2e of h5n1 and h7n9 h5n1-m2e vaccination with either freund's adjuvant or the sigma adjuvant system sas induced a high level of anti-m2e antibody which cross-reacted with h7n9-m2e peptide a mouse-adapted h7n9 strain a/anhui/01/2013m was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments h5n1-m2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the h7n9 virus reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice our results suggest that the tetrameric h5n1-m2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections therefore this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza a h7n9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus
the number of emerging infectious diseases is increasing characterizing novel or re-emerging infections is aided by the availability of pathogen genomes in this review we evaluate methods that exploit pathogen sequences and the contribution of genomic analysis to understand the epidemiology of recently emerged infectious diseases
in march 2013 three fatal human cases of infection with influenza a virus h7n9 were reported in china since then human cases have been accumulating given the public health importance of this virus we performed a pathogenicity study of the h7n9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model focusing on clinical aspects of disease radiographic histological and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection cynomolgus macaques developed transient mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans albeit less severe with diffuse alveolar damage infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells formation of hyaline membranes pneumocyte hyperplasia and fibroproliferative changes analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during h7n9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication overall h7n9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human h7n9 infection h n gao et al n engl h7n9 virus-induced disease in humans is often very severe and even lethal the majority of reported h7n9 cases occurred in older people and people with underlying medical conditions to better understand the pathogenicity of this virus healthy cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with influenza a virus h7n9 cynomolgus macaques were used as a model because the receptor distribution for h7n9 virus in macaques was recently shown to be more similar to that in humans than that of other frequently used animal models from comparison with previous studies we conclude that the emerging h7n9 influenza virus was more pathogenic in cynomolgus macaques than seasonal influenza a viruses and most isolates of the pandemic h1n1 virus but less pathogenic than the 1918 spanish influenza virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai h5n1 virus
this review examines the biology of ticks and tick-borne infections in the united states the most common tick-borne diseases in dogs and cats are discussed we demonstrate that there is much interest in tick-borne infections at the level of the lay public pet owners describe trends in the distribution and prevalence of tick-borne infections in the united states summarize some issues in understanding the degree of ill health due to tick-borne infections and suggest some avenues for research that would clarify these issues
coronavirus disease 2019 threatens global public health and economy in order to develop safe and effective vaccines suitable animal models must be established here we report the rapid adaption of sars-cov-2 in balb/c mice based on which a convenient economical and effective animal model was developed specifically we found that mouse-adapted sars-cov-2 at passage 6 macsp6 efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type balb/c mice resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses the elevated infectivity of macsp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue n501y in the receptorbinding domain rbd using this novel animal model we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an rbd-based sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against sars-cov-2 macsp6 challenge this novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of sars-cov-2 vaccine this study describes a unique mouse model for sars-cov-2 infection and confirms protective efficacy of a sars-cov-2 rbd subunit vaccine
antibodies are an important component in host immune responses to viral pathogens because of their unique maturation process antibodies can evolve to be highly specific to viral antigens physicians and researchers have been relying on such high specificity in their quest to understand host-viral interaction and viral pathogenesis mechanisms and to find potential cures for viral infection and disease with more than 60 recombinant monoclonal antibodies developed for human use in the last 20 years monoclonal antibodies are now considered a viable therapeutic modality for infectious disease targets including newly emerging viral pathogens such as ebola representing heightened public health concerns as well as pathogens that have long been known such as human cytomegalovirus here we summarize some recent advances in identification and characterization of monoclonal antibodies suitable as drug candidates for clinical evaluation and review some promising candidates in the development pipeline
hemorrhagic fever in humans the geographic range of human cchf cases largely reflects the presence of ticks however highly similar cchfv lineages occur in geographically distant regions tick-infested migratory birds have been suggested but not confirmed to contribute to the dispersal bats have recently been shown to carry nairoviruses distinct from cchfv in order to assess the presence of cchfv in a wide range of bat species over a wide geographic range we analyzed 1135 sera from 16 different bat species collected in congo gabon ghana germany and panama using a cchfv glycoproteinbased indirect immunofluorescence test iift we identified reactive antibodies in 10.0% 114/1135 of tested bats pertaining to 12/16 tested species depending on the species 3.6%-42.9% of cave-dwelling bats and 0.6%-7.1% of foliage-living bats were seropositive two-tailed t-test p = 0.0447 cave versus foliage 11/30 iift-reactive sera from 10 different african bat species had neutralizing activity in a viruslike particle assay neutralization of full cchfv was confirmed in 5 of 7 sera widespread infection of cave-dwelling bats may indicate a role for bats in the life cycle and geographic dispersal of cchfv
bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov nipah virus and hendra virus in this study consensus primer-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions rt-pcrs and high-throughput sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected at 11 natural bat habitat sites from july to december 2015 in korea diverse coronaviruses were first detected in korean bat faeces including alphacoronaviruses sars-cov-like and mers-cov-like betacoronaviruses in addition we identified a novel bat rotavirus belonging to group h rotavirus which has only been described in human and pigs until now therefore our results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional virological studies in domestic bat
bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin we characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species which were sampled in three locations of yunnan province by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays and next-generation sequencing seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by rt-pcr using degenerate primers and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera rubulavirus henipavirus and jeilongvirus various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using illumina sequencing a total of 7066 assembled contigs ≥200 bp were constructed and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families 1 insect virus and 1 mycovirus 17 were parasites and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms among theviruses 2014 6 2139 103 vertebrate viral contigs 79 displayed low identity <70% to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses overall the most frequently identified viruses particularly in bats from the family hipposideridae were retroviruses the present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in yunnan china and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans
the virus has caused much mortality and morbidity to humans and still posed a serious threat to the global public health the virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics however there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential this study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences the k-nearest neighbor knn model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. even for the knn models built on the contigs as short as 1kb they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences this work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies
we have previously described the generation of a novel ebola virus ebov vaccine platform based on a replicationcompetent rabies virus rabv b replication-deficient rabv or c chemically inactivated rabv expressing ebov glycoprotein gp mouse studies demonstrated safety immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these live or inactivated rabv/ebov vaccines here we evaluated these vaccines in nonhuman primates our results indicate that all three vaccines do induce potent immune responses against both rabv and ebov while the protection of immunized animals against ebov was largely dependent on the quality of humoral immune response against ebov gp we also determined if the induced antibodies against ebov gp differ in their target affinity or the isotype our results show that igg1-biased humoral responses as well as high levels of gp-specific antibodies were beneficial for the control of ebov infection after immunization these results further support the concept that a successful ebov vaccine needs to induce strong antibodies against ebov we also showed that a dual vaccine against rabv and filoviruses is achievable therefore addressing concerns for the marketability of this urgently needed vaccine
background the genus orthobornavirus comprises non-segmented negative-stranded rna viruses able to infect humans mammals reptiles and various birds parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 pabv-1 to 8 causes neurological and/or gastrointestinal syndromes and death on psittacines we aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female psittacus erithacus grey parrot methods and results both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy tissue samples were analysed by pcr the findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection analysis revealed pabv-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds the n and x proteins of pabv-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 vsbv-1 within the p gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found conclusions portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses pabv-4 phosphoprotein is closer to vsbv-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses the highly conserved p gene/ phosphoprotein region is a good target for molecular diagnostics screenings article history
rotavirus and coronavirus are two main causes of severe diarrhea in human infants and many animal species worldwide calves up to 3 months old can be affected by these viruses the importance of these viruses in cattle industry is due to substantial economic loss treatment costs and reduced growth rates in beef and dairy calves mixed infections caused by rotavirus and coronavirus can lead to severe form of diarrhea in present casecontrol study 261 samples of healthy and diarrheic calves from farms around mashhad were collected these samples were tested by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bio-x diagnosis kit the results showed that the prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus infection in diarrheic calves is 26.98% and 3.17% respectively also there was no significant relationship between infection with rotavirus coronavirus and diarrhea in the studied population
although the cause of multiple sclerosis ms is not known an immunologic process is generally considered to be an important element in the pathogenesis of the disease.'evidence of an immunologic mechanism is however circumstantial the perivenular inflammatory response comprised of lymphocytes and monocytes is certainly consistent with an immunologically mediated disease and resembles the pathologic changes seen in postvaccinal encephalomyelitis a disease of certain immunologic cause the similarities between ms and a model of immunopathologic disease of the central nervous system cns experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae also supports a similar mechanism in ms the objections to the appropriateness of eae as a model for ms have been partially overcome by the demonstration of an experimentally produced relapsing remitting disease with close pathologic similarities to ms.2 the relationship between ms and eae remains uncertain but it is clear that the induction of ms is considerably more complex further support for an immunologic mechanism in ms comes from the demonstration of abnormalities of immunoglobulin ig and lymphocyte populations and function in the disease alterations in cerebrospinal fluid csf ig represent the most consistent immunologic changes described in ms which reflects their diagnostic importance the increased levels of ig largely synthesized locally in the csf' and the oligoclonal nature of this ig4 have led to the contention that ms may be directly related to antibody reactivity with components of myelin despite extensive investigations a clear association between csf ig reactivity and the disease has not been established increased antibody levels to numerous viruses have been found and in each case they represent a small fraction of the ig present small amounts of antibody to myelin components have been described but again it is unlikely that these antibodies are directly or singularly responsible for the demyelinati~n.~ an alternative explanation for the increased ig with multiple specificities is that it merely reflects the specificities of b cells or plasma cells that have migrated into the inflammatory sites within the cns the antibody specificities found in the csf in ms are generally those found in high titers in the serum this finding suggests that b cells with these specificities have a relatively high precursor frequency and if circulating would have a greater chance of migrating into an inflammatory site by chance although their accumulation may be random the conditions permitting their differentiation into ig-producing cells must be present within the cns because the oligoclonal ig pattern found in the csf is often relatively constant over time it seems likely that some b-cell populations or clones are maintained and undergo continued differentiation within the cns generally differentiation and ig production require two signals one of which is the perturbation of the ig antigen receptor if the antigens 99
among approximately 1000 adenoviruses from chimpanzees and bonobos studied recently the pan adenovirus type 3 panad3 isolated from a bonobo pan paniscus has one of the best profiles for a vaccine vector combining potent transgene immunogenicity with minimal pre-existing immunity in the human population in this study we inserted into a replication defective panad3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein np and matrix 1 m1 we then studied antibody and t cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model a single intranasal administration of panad3-npm1 vaccine induced strong antibody and t cell responses and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge thus panad3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines including universal influenza vaccines
equine rotaviruses were first detected in foals over 30 years ago and remain a major cause of infectious diarrhoea in foals during this time there has been substantial progress in the development of sensitive methods to detect rotaviruses in foals enabling surveillance of the genotypes present in various horse populations however there has been limited epidemiological investigation into the significance of these circulating genotypes their correlation with disease and the use of vaccination in these animal populations our knowledge of the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection in foals is based on a limited number of studies on a small number of foals and therefore most of our understanding in this area has been extrapolated from studies in other species questions such as the concentrations of rotavirus particles shed in the faeces of infected foals both with and without diarrhoea and factors determining the presence or absence of clinical disease remain to be investigated as does the relative and absolute efficacy of currently available vaccines the answer to these questions may help direct research into the development of more effective control measures ß
rabies virus rabv is the only lyssavirus known to be present within the caribbean the island of trinidad is richly diverse in chiropteran fauna and endemic for bat-transmitted rabies with low rabv isolation rates observed in this population we aimed to determine the seroprevalence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies rvna in light of spatio-temporal and bat demographic factors to infer the extent of natural exposure to rabv in the trinidadian bat population rvna titers were determined by the rabv micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity from 31 locations across the island over 5 years rvna was positively detected in 33 samples 8.6% representing 6 bat species mainly frugivorous with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 iu/ml mean 1.66 iu/ml the analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity thus juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults estimate 1.13 p = 0.04 which may suggest early exposure to the rabv with possible implications for viral amplification in this population temporal variation in rabies seropositivity 2012-2014 versus 2015-2017 estimate 1.07 p = 0.03 may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation regarding other factors investigated rvna was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species the most common seropositive species artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure the findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in trinidad
cryptosporidium is an obligate intracellular protist parasite infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts and causes significant intestinal disease in both animals and humans as some species are zoonotic cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist however little is known about the genetics of cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of france the aim of this study was to detect and isolate cryptosporidium spp in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves ≤45 days-old in france a total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments french administrative provinces cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent dfa staining method dfa-positive samples were then analysed by pcr-rflp and 18s rrna gene sequencing to determine species cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested pcr analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kda glycoprotein gp60 gene product data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis dfa revealed the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 88% samples combined with 18s rrna gene analysis results c parvum was detected in 30 samples subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples 90% of the c parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families iia 24/27 and iid 3/27 four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family iia including the hypertransmissible iiaa15g2r1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide 21/ 27 iiaa17g3r1 1/27 iiaa17g1r1 1/27 and iiaa19g1r1 1/27 two subtypes were recognised within the iid subtype family including iida22g1 2/27 and iida27g1 1/27 these findings illustrate the high occurrence of cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised c parvum isolates with the first description of iiaa17g3r1 iiaa19g1r1 and iid subtypes in france the presence of zoonotic c parvum subtype families iia iid in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic c parvum and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other french regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in france however due to strong inter-species similarities in microscopic size and shape species within this genus require additional identification via genetic characterization molecular biology techniques have enabled the description of species that are highly host-specific as well as others that are capable of infecting many hosts cryptosporidium parvum is considered to be the most prevalent species worldwide and a major zoonotic transmission risk xiao 2010 . using molecular approaches to genetically characterise cryptosporidium spp has facilitated an
the recent ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the therapeutic potential of antisera and renewed interest in this treatment approach while human convalescent sera may not be readily available in the early stages of an outbreak antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame here we compared adjuvanted virus-like particles vlp with recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv both expressing the ebola virus antigens the neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted vlps were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent vsv indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies this approach also yielded high-titer antisera against nipah virus glycoproteins illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families multiple-step immunoglobulin g purification using a two-step 20-40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein a affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability adjuvanted vlp-based immunization strategies are thus a promising approach for the rapid generation of therapeutic antisera against emerging infections
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infection in infants immunoprophylaxis with the anti-rsv monoclonal antibody palivizumab reduces the risk for rsv-related hospitalizations but its use is restricted to high-risk infants due to the high costs in this study we investigated if genetic delivery of anti-rsv antibody to neonatal mice by chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 expressing the murine form of palivizumab adc7αrsv can provide protection against rsv intranasal and intramuscular administration of adc7αrsv to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-rsv igg in the serum however only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-rsv igg in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid intranasal administration of adc7αrsv provided protection against subsequent rsv challenge expression of the anti-rsv antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of adc7αrsv to neonatal mice protection against rsv was confirmed at 6 weeks of age these data suggest that neonatal genetic delivery of anti-rsv antibody by adc7αrsv can provide protection against rsv
virus-like particles vlps are nanostructures that resemble the structures of viruses they are composed of one or more structural proteins that can be arranged in several layers and can also contain a lipid outer envelope vlps trigger a high humoral and cellular immune response due to their repetitive structures a key factor regarding vlp safety is the lack of viral genomic material which enhances safety during both manufacture and administration contemporary vlp production may take advantage of several systems including bacterial yeast insect and mammalian cells the choice of production platform depends on several factors including cost and the need for post-translational modifications ptms which can be essential in generating an optimal immune response some vlp-based vaccines designed to prevent several infectious diseases are already approved and on the market with many others at the clinical trial or research stage interest in this technology has recently increased due to its advantages over classical vaccines this paper reviews the state-of-the-art of vlp production systems and the newest generation of vlp-based vaccines now available
the sand cat felis margarita is a small-sized felid found in sand and stone deserts ranging from the north of africa to asia with the arabian peninsula as its centre of distribution the sand cat captive breeding program at the breeding centre for endangered arabian wildlife bceaw sharjah uae has experienced high newborn mortality rates and congenital toxoplasmosis was recently recognized as one of the causes of this mortality in the present study one 18-month-old sand cat fm019 died of acute toxoplasmosis-associated hepatitis and pneumonitis acquired after birth toxoplasma gondii was demonstrated in histological sections which reacted with t gondii polyclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry ihc t gondii dna was found by pcr of extracted dna from liver and lung tissues of this cat antibodies to t gondii were found in serum examined in 11600 dilution in the modified agglutination test mat its 2-year-old cage mate seroconverted mat titer 13200 at the same time another sand cat fm017 was euthanized because of ill health when 3 years old its mat titer was >13200 and t gondii tissue cysts were found in brain heart ocular muscles and skeletal muscle confirmed by ihc viable t gondii was isolated by bioassays in mice inoculated with tissues of another chronically infected sand cat fm002 t gondii was not found in histological sections of this cat t gondii antibodies were found in several species of animals tested notably in 49 of 57 wild felids at bceaw a 7-year-old sand cat 3657 from al wabra wildlife preservation awwp doha state of qatar died of acute visceral toxoplasmosis with demonstrable t gondii tachyzoites by ihc and t gondii dna by pcr and a mat titer of >3200 t gondii antibodies were found in 21 of 27 of wild felids at awwp pcr-rflp genotyping at 10 genetic loci revealed that these t gondii isolates from sand cat fm002 and fm019 at bceaw have an atypical genotype which was previously reported in t gondii isolates of dogs from sri lanka the genotype from the cat from awwp 3657 is a genetic type ii strain with a type i allele at locus apico this is the first report of genetic characterization of t gondii isolates from middle east
serum neutralizing antibody titers are indicative of protective immunity against coxsackievirus a16 cv-a16 and enterovirus 71 ev71 the two main etiological agents of hand foot and mouth disease hfmd and provide the basis for evaluating vaccine efficacy the current cv-a16 neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effects requires manual microscopic examination which is time-consuming and labor-intensive in this study a high-throughput neutralization assay was developed by employing cv-a16 pseudoviruses expressing luciferase for detecting infectivity in rhabdomyosarcoma rd cells and measuring serum viral neutralizing antibodies without the need to use infectious cv-a16 strains the neutralizing antibody titer against cv-a16 could be determined within 15 h by measuring luciferase signals by this assay the pseudovirus cv-a16 neutralization assay pcna was validated by comparison with a conventional cv-a16 neutralization assay ccna in testing 174 human serum samples collected from children age <5 years the neutralizing antibody titers determined by these two assays were well correlated r 2 = 0.7689 these results suggest that the pcna can serve as a rapid and objective procedure for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies against cv-a16
while direct contact may sometimes be sufficient to allow a pathogen to jump into a new host species in other cases fortuitously adaptive mutations that arise in the original donor host are also necessary viruses have been the focus of most host shift studies so less is known about the importance of ecological versus evolutionary processes to successful bacterial host shifts here we tested whether direct contact with the novel host was sufficient to enable the mid-1990s jump of the bacterium mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to house finches haemorhous mexicanus we experimentally inoculated house finches with two genetically distinct m gallisepticum strains obtained either from poultry rlow or from house finches hf1995 during an epizootic outbreak all 15 house finches inoculated with hf1995 became infected whereas rlow successfully infected 12 of 15 80% inoculated house finches comparisons among infected birds showed that relative to hf1995 rlow achieved substantially lower bacterial loads in the host respiratory mucosa and was cleared faster furthermore rlow-infected finches were less likely to develop clinical symptoms than hf1995-infected birds and when they did displayed milder conjunctivitis the lower infection success of rlow relative to hf1995 was not however due to a heightened host antibody response to rlow taken together our results indicate that contact between infected poultry and house finches was not by itself sufficient to explain the jump of m gallisepticum to house finches instead mutations arising in the original poultry host would have been necessary for successful pathogen emergence in the novel finch host
thiazolides are polypharmacology agents with at least three mechanisms of action against a broad spectrum of parasites bacteria and viruses in respiratory viruses they inhibit the replication of orthomyxoviridae and paramyxoviridae at a post-translational level nitazoxanide 1a the prototype thiazolide was originally developed as an antiparasitic agent and later repurposed for the treatment of viral respiratory infections the second generation thiazolides following nitazoxanide such as the 5-chloro analogue rm-5038 2a are also broad-spectrum antiviral agents as we have reported both 1a and its effective circulating metabolite tizoxanide 1b are 5-nitrothiazole derivatives while rm-5038 2a and its de-acetyl derivative rm-4848 2b are the corresponding 5-chloro derivatives recently 1a has completed phase ii-iii clinical trials in the united states canada australia and new zealand in a total of 2865 adults and adolescents of at least 12 months of age with viral acute respiratory illness since its biodisposition is primarily seen in the gastro-intestinal tract its efficacy in systemic viral diseases requires relatively high oral doses the chemical synthesis of new derivatives with a better systemic absorption was therefore urgently needed in order to improve their systemic absorption new amino-ester prodrug derivatives of 1b and rm4848 2b were prepared and tested for their animal pharmacology pharmacokinetics and toxicology rm-5061 8a in rats showed 7-fold higher blood concentration compared to 1a absolute bioavailability increased from 3 to 20% with a good safety profile in animal safety pharmacology and toxicology
feline infectious peritonitis fip is an immune-mediated highly lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus fcov infection currently no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent fcov isolates since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing fip and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon-γ ifn-γ production we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms snp in the feline ifn-γ gene fifng are associated with the outcome of infection a total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 fip cats were analyzed and 16 snp were identified in intron 1 of fifng among these snp the ffing + 428 t allele was shown to be a fip-resistant allele p = 0.03 and the heterozygous genotypes 01c/t and +408c/t were found to be fip-susceptible factors p = 0.004 furthermore an fifng + 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of ifn-γ in fip cats for the identification of these three fip-related snp genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system pcr arms-pcr and restriction fragment length polymorphisms rflp and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing the identification of additional fip-related snp will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to fip
clinical respiratory illness was compared in five homozygous chicken lines originating from homozygous b2 b8 b12 and b19 and heterozygous b2/b12 birds after infection with either of two strains of the infectious bronchitis virus ibv all chickens used in these studies originated from white leghorn and ancona linages ibv gray strain infection of mhc homozygous b12 and b19 haplotype chicks resulted in severe respiratory disease compared to chicks with b2/b2 and b5/b5 haplotypes demonstrating a dominant b2 phenotype b2/b12 birds were also more resistant to ibv respiratory clinical illness in b8/b8 chicks was severe early after infection while illness resolved similar to the b5 and b2 homozygous birds following m41 strain infection birds with b2/b2 and b8/b8 haplotypes were again more resistant to clinical illness than b19/b19 birds real time rt-pcr indicated that infection was cleared more efficiently in trachea lungs and kidneys of b2/b2 and b8/b8 birds compared with b19/b19 birds furthermore m41 infected b2/b2 and b8/b8 chicks performed better in terms of body weight gain than b19/b19 chicks these studies suggest that genetics of b defined haplotypes might be exploited to produce chicks resistant to respiratory pathogens or with more effective immune responses
immunological memory is important for protecting the host from reinfection to investigate the development and sites of residence of intestinal memory b cells and their role in protective immunity to reinfection with an enteric virus we assessed the association between memory b cell and antibody-secreting cell asc responses and protection using a gnotobiotic pig model for human rotavirus hrv infection and diarrhoea the isotypes quantities and tissue distribution of rotavirus-speci®c memory b cells and asc were evaluated prechallenge 28 and 83 postinoculation days and postchallenge 7 postchallenge days using enzyme-linked immunospot elispot assay in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated once with virulent or three times with attenuated hrv and challenged at pid 28 with the corresponding virulent hrv complete protection against hrv shedding and diarrhoea was associated with signi®cantly higher numbers of immunoglobulin a iga and immunoglobulin g igg memory b cells and asc in the ileum of virulent hrv-inoculated pigs at challenge in contrast pigs inoculated with attenuated hrv had lower numbers of iga and igg memory b cells and asc in intestinal lymphoid tissues but higher numbers in the spleen the bone marrow had the lowest mean numbers of iga and igg memory b cells and asc prechallenge in both groups of hrv-inoculated pigs therefore bone marrow was not a site for iga and igg rotavirus-speci®c antibody production or for memory b cells after inoculation with live rotavirus from 28 pid up to at least 83 pid the effect of in vitro antigen dose was examined and it was determined to play an important role in the development of asc from memory b cells for the different tissues examined
human coronaviruses hcovs are large rna viruses that infect the human respiratory tract the emergence of both severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome covs as well as the yearly circulation of four common covs highlights the importance of elucidating the different mechanisms employed by these viruses to evade the host immune response determine their tropism and identify antiviral compounds various animal models have been established to investigate hcov infection including mice and non-human primates to establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans an organotypic human airway culture system that recapitulates the human airway epithelium has been developed currently different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways including the air-liquid interface ali human airway epithelium hae model tracheobronchial hae cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli these organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines additionally the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals no commercial vaccine is available but various effective antivirals have been identified some with potential for human treatment these morphological airway cultures are also well suited for the identification of antivirals evaluation of compound toxicity and viral inhibition
memory b cells that are generated during an infection or following vaccination act as sentinels to guard against future infections upon repeat antigen exposure memory b cells differentiate into new antibody-secreting plasma cells to provide rapid and sustained protection some pathogens evade or suppress the humoral immune system or induce memory b cells with a diminished ability to differentiate into new plasma cells this leaves the host vulnerable to chronic or recurrent infections single cell approaches coupled with next generation antibody gene sequencing facilitate a detailed analysis of the pathogen-specific memory b cell repertoire monoclonal antibodies that are generated from antibody gene sequences allow a functional analysis of the repertoire this review discusses what has been learned thus far from analysis of diverse pathogen-specific memory b cell compartments and describes major differences in their repertoires such information may illuminate ways to advance the goal of improving vaccine and therapeutic antibody design
against a backdrop of seasonal influenza virus epidemics emerging avian influenza viruses aivs occasionally jump from birds to humans posing a public health risk especially with the recent sharp increase in h7n9 infections evaluations of cross-reactive t-cell immunity to seasonal influenza viruses and humaninfecting aivs have been reported previously however the roles of influenza a virus-derived epitopes in the cross-reactive t-cell responses and heterosubtypic protections are not well understood understanding those roles is important for preventing and controlling new emerging aivs here among the members of a healthy population presumed to have previously been infected by pandemic h1n1 ph1n1 we found that ph1n1-specific t cells showed cross-but biased reactivity to humaninfecting aivs i e h5n1 h6n1 h7n9 and h9n2 which correlates with distinct protections through a t-cell epitope-based phylogenetic analysis the cellular immunogenic clustering expanded the relevant conclusions to a broader range of virus strains we defined the potential key conserved epitopes required for cross-protection and revealed the molecular basis for the immunogenic variations our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to aivs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development importance we revealed preexisting but biased t-cell reactivity of ph1n1 influenza virus to human-infecting aivs which provided distinct protections the crossreactive t-cell recognition had a regular pattern that depended on the t-cell epitope matrix revealed via bioinformatics analysis our study elucidated an overall profile of cross-reactivity to aivs and provided useful recommendations for broad-spectrum vaccine development
we evaluated the efficacy of three sars vaccine candidates in a murine sars model utilizing lowvirulence pp and sars-cov coinfection vaccinated mice were protected from severe respiratory disease in parallel with a low virus titer in the lungs and a high neutralizing antibody titer in the plasma importantly the administration of spike protein-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody protected mice from the disease indicating that the neutralization is sufficient for protection moreover a high level of il-6 and mcp-1 production but not other 18 cytokines tested on days 2 and 3 after sars-cov infection was closely linked to the virus replication and disease severity suggesting the importance of these cytokines in the lung pathogenicity of sars-cov infection
background as a result of rapidly growing human populations intensification of livestock production and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal agriculture the interface between wildlife livestock and humans is expanding with potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population given this background we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs potamochoerus larvatus a nocturnal species of wild suid known to move between national parks and farmland in uganda results application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of torque teno sus virus ttsuv porcine parvovirus 4 ppv4 porcine endogenous retrovirus perv a gb hepatitis c-like virus and a sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs pcr assays for each specific virus combined with sanger sequencing revealed two ttsuv-1 variants one ttsuv-2 variant as well as ppv4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing
most traditional vaccines are composed either of a whole pathogen or its parts these vaccines however are not always effective and can even be harmful as such additional agents known as adjuvants are necessary to increase vaccine safety and efficacy this review summarizes the potential of biodegradable materials including synthetic and natural polymers for vaccine delivery these materials are highly biocompatible and have minimal toxicity and most biomaterial-based vaccines delivering antigens or adjuvants have been shown to improve immune response compared to formulations consisting of the antigen alone therefore these materials can be applied in modern vaccine development
in order to determine highly immunogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov epitope peptides capable of inducing long-lasting immunity we first screened immunoglobulin-g igg antibodies reactive to 197 different overlapping 15-mers from the sars-cov proteins in the sera of three infected patients forty-two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients consequently we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera n ¼ 45 at 6-month post-infection the significantly higher levels of igg antibodies specific to three s791 m207 and n161 of 42 peptides were detectable in the post-infection sera from 23 51% 27 60% and 19 42% of 45 patients respectively these three peptides recognized by their long-lasting immunity may provide a better understanding of the immunogenicity of sars-cov a novel coronavirus sars-cov was discovered in association with the cases of life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that occurred in march of 2003 1 2 the genome of the sars-cov is 29727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses 3 since march of 2003 studies to determine immunogenic epitopes have been performed at a fast pace within a short period of time because of the urgent need to develop both therapeutic and diagnostic modalities for the sars-cov 4-8 the results of these studies indicate that both the spike s and nucleocapsid n proteins of the sars-cov contain immunogenic regions howeverfurther studies are needed in order to identify the hot spots for which diagnostic and therapeutic tools can be developed in order to determine highly immunogenic regions an investigation was performed of sars-cov epitope peptides capable of inducing long-lasting immunity and the three candidate peptides have been reported in this study
old world frugivorous bats have been identified as natural hosts for emerging zoonotic viruses of significant public health concern including henipaviruses nipah and hendra virus ebola virus and marburg virus epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics with particular attention paid to juveniles whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes however little is understood about bat immunology including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans we conducted two separate studies of pregnant pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1 canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive pteropus hypomelanus and 2 hendra virus in wild-caught naturally infected pteropus alecto both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses we found that in both species antibodies were transferred from dam to pup in p hypomelanus pups titers against cdv waned over a mean period of 228.6 days 95% ci 185.4-271.8 and had a mean terminal phase halflife of 96.0 days ci 95% 30.7-299.7 in p alecto pups antibodies waned over 255.13 days 95% ci 221.0-289.3 and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days ci 95% 33.76-80.83 each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months which was longer than has been previously estimated these data will allow for more accurate interpretation of age-related henipavirus serological data collected from wild pteropid bats
the henipaviruses represented by hendra hev and nipah niv viruses are highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses with uniquely broad host tropisms responsible for repeated outbreaks in australia southeast asia india and bangladesh the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with infection and lack of licensed antiviral therapies make the henipaviruses a potential biological threat to humans and livestock henipavirus entry is initiated by the attachment of the g envelope glycoprotein to host cell membrane receptors previously henipavirus-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies hmab have been isolated using the hev-g glycoprotein and a human naïve antibody library one cross-reactive and receptor-blocking hmab m102.4 was recently demonstrated to be an effective post-exposure therapy in two animal models of niv and hev infection has been used in several people on a compassionate use basis and is currently in development for use in humans here we report the crystal structure of the complex of hev-g with m102.3 an m102.4 derivative and describe niv and hev escape mutants this structure provides detailed insight into the mechanism of hev and niv neutralization by m102.4 and serves as a blueprint for further optimization of m102.4 as a therapeutic agent and for the development of entry inhibitors and vaccines
theileria parva t parva causes east coast fever ecf which is of huge economic importance to eastern and southern african countries in a previous bovine model inflammatory cytokines were closely associated with disease progression in animals experimentally infected with t parva the african cape buffalo syncerus caffer the natural reservoir for t parva is completely resistant to ecf despite a persistently high parasitaemia following infection with t parva characterizing basic immunological interactions in the host is critical to understanding the mechanism underlying disease resistance in the african cape buffalo in this study the expression level of several cytokines was analyzed in t parva-infected buffaloes there were no significant differences in the expression profiles of inflammatory cytokines between the infected and uninfected animals despite a remarkably high parasitaemia in the former however the expression level of il-10 was significantly upregulated in the infected animals these results indicate a correlation between diminished inflammatory cytokines response and disease resistance in the buffalo
background the urgent medical need for innovative approaches to control influenza is emphasized by the widespread resistance of circulating subtype h1n1 viruses to the leading antiviral drug oseltamivir the pandemic threat posed by the occurrences of human infections with highly pathogenic avian h5n1 viruses and indeed the evolving swine-origin h1n1 influenza pandemic a recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses including h1 h2 h5 h6 and h9 subtypes has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class methodology/principal findings we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody cr6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian h5n1 virus in ferrets the optimal model of human influenza infection survival rates clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract as well as macro-and microscopic pathology were investigated prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg cr6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9% abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented h5n1-induced lung pathology when administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge 30 mg/kg cr6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise reduced lung viral loads and shedding and less lung damage conclusions/significance these data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza
antibody phage display is an in vitro technology to generate recombinant antibodies in particular for pathogens like viruses or toxins antibody phage display is an alternative to hybridoma technology since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system phage display allows the generation of human antibodies from naive antibody gene libraries when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible this technology also allows the construction of immune libraries to select in vivo affinity matured antibodies if immunized patients or animals are available in this review we describe the generation of human and human-like antibodies from naive antibody gene libraries and antibodies from immune antibody gene libraries furthermore we give an overview about phage display derived recombinant antibodies against viruses and toxins for diagnostics and therapy
significant concerns have arisen over the past 3 y from the increased global spread of the mosquitoborne flavivirus zika accompanying this spread has been an increase in cases of the devastating birth defect microcephaly as well as of guillain-barré syndrome in adults in many affected countries currently there is no vaccine or therapy for this infection however we sought to develop a combination approach that provides more rapid and durable protection than traditional vaccination alone a novel immune-based prophylaxis/therapy strategy entailing the facilitated delivery of a synthetic dna consensus prme vaccine along with dna-encoded anti-zikv envelope monoclonal antibodies dmab were developed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy this immediate and persistent protection strategy confers the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination or passive immunotherapy a collection of novel dmabs were developed which were potent against zikv and could be expressed in serum within 24-48 h of in vivo administration the dna vaccine from a previous development was potent after adaptive immunity was developed protecting against infection brain and testes pathology in relevant mouse challenge models and in an nhp challenge delivery of potent dmabs protected mice from the same murine viral challenge within days of delivery combined injection of dmab and the dna vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection in this challenge model providing an important demonstration of the advantage of this synergistic approach to pandemic outbreaks article history
in conjunction with an increasing public awareness of infectious diseases the textile industry and scientists are developing hygienic fabrics by the addition of various antimicrobial and antiviral compounds in the current study sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan are applied to cotton fabrics in order to gain antimicrobial and antiviral properties for the first time the antimicrobial activity of textiles treated with 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate 0.03 % triclosan and 7 % glucapon has been investigated against a broad range of microorganisms including bacteria yeast and fungi moreover modified cotton fabrics were tested against adenovirus type 5 and poliovirus type 1 according to the test results the modified textile goods attained very good antimicrobial and antiviral properties thus the results of the present study clearly suggest that sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan solution-treated textiles can be considered in the development of antimicrobial and antiviral textile finishes
to date infectious bronchitis virus ibv is potentially found in wild birds of different species this work reports the survey of coronaviruses in wild birds from madagascar based on the targeting of a conserved genome sequence among different groups of covs phyl o g e n e t i c a n a l y s e s r e v e a l e d t h e p r e s e n c e o f gammacoronaviruses in different species of gruiformes passeriformes ciconiiformes anseriformes and charadriiformes furthermore some sequences were related to various ibv strains aquatic and migratory birds may play an important role in the maintenance and spread of coronaviruses in nature highlighting their possible contribution in the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in wild and domestic birds
background antibodies constitute a powerful tool to study protein function protein localization and proteinprotein interactions as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes high-throughput antibody development requires faster methodologies with lower antigen consumption results here we describe a novel methodology to select human monoclonal recombinant antibodies by combining in vitro protein expression phage display antibody libraries and antibody microarrays the application of this combination of methodologies permitted us to generate human single-chain variable fragments scfvs against two proteins green fluorescent protein gfp and thioredoxin trx in a short time using as low as 5 μg of purified protein these scfvs showed specific reactivity against their respective targets and worked well by elisa and western blot the scfvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot conclusion this work describes a novel and miniaturized methodology to obtain human monoclonal recombinant antibodies against any target in a shorter time than other methodologies using only 5 μg of protein the protocol could be easily adapted to a high-throughput procedure for antibody production
feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv is a coronavirus that induces a fatal systemic disease mediated by an inappropriate immune response most previous vaccination attempts against fipv were unsuccessful because igg antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection however two studies have shown that poxvirus vectors vaccinia wr and canarypox expressing only the fipv membrane m protein can elicit a partially protective immunity which is supposed to be cell-mediated virology 181 1991 327 international patent wo 97/20054 1997 in our study we report the construction of another poxvirus the modified vaccinia virus ankara mva as an expression vector for the fipv m protein in this vector the m gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the m protein during their early stage only the immunogenicity of the recombinant mva-m was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the th1/th2 balance the vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an fipv 79-1146 challenge vaccinated kittens developed fipv-specific antibodies after immunization however none of them was protected against fipv our results suggest a crucial role for the type of poxviral promoter that must be used to induce an effective immune response against fipv
the variable region genes of a murine anti-coronavirus monoclonal antibody mab were joined by assembly polymerase chain reaction and expressed in escherichia coli in a single chain variable fragment scfv configuration after induction of expression the expected 32-kda protein was identified by western immunoblotting with specific rabbit anti-idiotype antibodies the scfv fragments were purified from soluble cytoplasmic preparations by affinity chromatography on nickel agarose which was possible with an n-terminal but not with a c-terminal histidine tag purified scfv fragments retained the antigen-binding properties of the parental antibody could inhibit its binding to viral antigens with apparently higher efficiency than monovalent antigen-binding fab fragments but neutralized viral infectivity with lower efficiency about sevenfold at a molar level to evaluate the usefulness of these smaller and less immunogenic molecules in the treatment of viral diseases mice were treated with purified recombinant scfv fragments and challenged with a lethal viral dose a small delay in mortality was observed for the scfv-treated animals therefore even though the scfv could neutralize viral infectivity in vitro the same quantity of fragments that partially protected mice in the form of fab only slightly delayed virus-induced lethality when injected as scfv fragments probably because of a much faster in vivo clearance the biologic half-life was estimated to be about 6 min since a scfv derived from a highly neutralizing and protective mab is only marginally effective in the passive protection of mice from lethal viral infection the use of such reagents for viral immunotherapy will require strategies to overcome stability limitations
engineering vaccine-based therapeutics for infectious diseases is highly challenging as trial formulations are often found to be nonspecific ineffective thermally or hydrolytically unstable and/or toxic vaccines have greatly improved the therapeutic landscape for treating infectious diseases and have significantly reduced the threat by therapeutic and preventative approaches furthermore the advent of recombinant technologies has greatly facilitated growth within the vaccine realm by mitigating risks such as virulence reversion despite making the production processes more cumbersome in addition seroconversion can also be enhanced by recombinant technology through kinetic and nonkinetic approaches which are discussed herein recombinant technologies have greatly improved both amino acid-based vaccines and dna-based vaccines a plateau of interest has been reached between 2001 and 2010 for the scientific community with regard to dna vaccine endeavors the decrease in interest may likely be attributed to difficulties in improving immunogenic properties associated with dna vaccines although there has been research demonstrating improvement and optimization to this end despite improvement to the extent of our knowledge there are currently no regulatory body-approved dna vaccines for human use four vaccines approved for animal use this article discusses engineering dna vaccines against infectious diseases while discussing advantages and disadvantages of each with an emphasis on applications of these dna vaccines this review paper summarizes the state of the engineered/recombinant dna vaccine field with a scope entailing ''engineering dna vaccines against infectious diseases". we endeavor to emphasize recent advances recapitulating the current state of the field in addition to discussing dna therapeutics that have already been clinically translated this review also examines current research developments and the challenges thwarting further progression our review covers recombinant dna-based subunit vaccines internalization and processing enhancing immune protection via adjuvants manufacturing and engineering dna the safety stability and delivery of dna vaccines or plasmids controlling gene expression using plasmid engineering and gene circuits overcoming immunogenic issues and commercial successes we hope that this review will inspire further research in dna vaccine development
there are currently four commercially available vaccines in australia to protect chickens against infectious bronchitis virus ibv predominantly ibv causes clinical signs associated with respiratory or kidney disease which subsequently cause an increase in mortality rate three of the current vaccines belong to the same subgroup subgroup 1 however the vics vaccine has been reported to cause an increased vaccinal reaction compared to the other subgroup 1 vaccines molecular anomalies detected in vics suggested the presence of two major subspecies vics-v and vics-del present in the commercial preparation of vics the most notable anomaly is the absence of a 40 bp sequence in the 3 utr of vics-del in this investigation the two subspecies were isolated and shown to grow independently and to similar titres in embryonated chicken eggs an in vivo investigation involved 5 groups of 20 chickens each and found that vics-del grew to a significantly lesser extent in the chicken tissues collected than did vics-v the group inoculated with an even ratio of the isolated subspecies scored the most severe clinical signs with the longest duration these results indicate the potential for a cooperative instead of an expected competitive relationship between vics-v and vics-del to infect a host which is reminiscent of rna viral quasi-species
nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev are recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses exclusively grouped within a new genus henipavirus these viruses cause fatal disease in a wide range of species including humans both niv and hev have continued to re-emerge sporadically in bangladesh and australia respectively there are currently no therapeutics or vaccines available to treat henipavirus infection and both are classified as bsl4 pathogens rna interference rnai is a process by which double-stranded rna directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger rna in animal and plant cells small interfering rnas sirnas mediate rnai by inhibiting gene expression of homologous mrna and our preliminary studies suggest rnai may be a useful approach to developing novel therapies for these highly lethal pathogens eight niv sirna molecules four l and four n gene specific two hev n gene specific and two non-specific control sirna molecules were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit a henipavirus minigenome replication system which does not require the use of live virus in addition to live virus infections in vitro in the minigenome assay three out of the four sirnas that targeted the l gene of niv effectively inhibited replication in contrast only niv n gene sirnas were effective in reducing live niv replication suggesting inhibition of early abundantly expressed gene transcripts may be more effective than later less abundant transcripts additionally some of the sirnas effective against niv infection were only partially effective inhibitors of hev infection an inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of sirna inhibition was observed the demonstration that rnai effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro is a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal zoonotic pathogens
the human coronavirus nl63 was identified in 2004 and subsequent studies showed its worldwide distribution infection with this pathogen is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases of mild to moderate severity furthermore hcov-nl63 is the main cause of croup in children within this study an optimal protocol for freeze-drying that allows safe and effective preservation of hcov-nl63 infectious material was developed lyophilized virus preparations can be stored either at ambient temperature or at +4 • c in the latter case samples may be stored for at least two months surprisingly conducted analysis showed that hcov-nl63 virions are exquisitely stable in liquid media and can be stored also without preservatives at ambient temperature for up to 14 days
acute respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity in children both in developed and developing countries a wide range of respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza a and b viruses parainfluenza viruses pivs adenovirus rhinovirus hrv have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections lrti in children in the past decades however in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies newly discovered viruses have been identified including human metapneumovirus hmpv coronaviruses nl63 hcov-nl63 and hku1 hcov-hku1 human bocavirus hbov new enterovirus hev parechovirus hpev and rhinovirus hrv strains polyomaviruses wu wupyv and ki kipyv and the pandemic h1n1v influenza a virus these discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns in this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging this review will present an overview of newly recognized as well as the main emerging respiratory viruses and seek to focus on the their contribution to infection and co-infection in lrtis in childhood
mycobacterium tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death attributed to a single infectious organism bacillus calmette-guerin bcg the standard vaccine against m tuberculosis is thought to prevent only 5% of all vaccine-preventable deaths due to tuberculosis thus an alternative vaccine is required one of the principal barriers to vaccine development against m tuberculosis is the complexity of the immune response to infection with uncertainty as to what constitutes an immunological correlate of protection in this paper we seek to give an overview of the immunology of m tuberculosis infection and by doing so investigate possible targets of vaccine development this encompasses the innate adaptive mucosal and humoral immune systems though mva85a did not improve protection compared with bcg alone in a large-scale clinical trial the correlates of protection this has revealed in addition to promising results from candidate such as vpm1002 m72/aso1e and h56ic31 point to a brighter future in the field of tb vaccine development
are lacking the present study investigated these missing links during experimental infection of three spf cats with fecv strain ucd two cats showed mild clinical signs faecal shedding of infectious virus from 4 dpi a cell-associated viraemia at inconsistent time points from 5 dpi a highly neutralising antibody response from 9 dpi and no major abnormalities in leukocyte numbers faecal shedding lasted for 28-56 days but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations remarkably in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi and shedding of non-enterotropic mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats except for the cd8 + regulatory t cells these data indicate that fecv can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise feline coronaviruses fcovs occur as two pathotypes associated with either enteric or systemic diseases in cats feline enteric coronavirus fecv is an enterotropic virus ubiquitously present in the cat population 12 . the enteritis caused by the intestinal replication can manifest as a transient anorexia weight loss and/or diarrhoea but clinical signs are often too mild to be noticed 134 . feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv most likely arises from fecv by accumulation of mutations in individually infected cats . these yet not fully characterized mutations abrogate the enterocyte tropism but provide the virus with tools to productively replicate in monocytes/macrophages causing a highly fatal systemic disease feline infectious peritonitis fip which is characterised by a diffuse vasculitis polyserositis and severe lymphopaenia 12-17 . to date it remains unknown where when and how this pathotype switch is induced in fecv-infected cats due to its pathogenic behaviour fipv has received considerable attention and clinical virological and immunological parameters during both natural and experimental fipv infections have frequently been studied 14-16 . the last decade comprehensive studies on the fipv parent virus fecv have extensively contributed to our current understanding of the epizootiology and pathogenesis 418-20 but many crucial virological and immunological data on the fecv-cat interactions are missing to fully understand the behaviour of this fipv parent virus due to the lack of an fecv-susceptible cell line there is so far no information on the infectivity and its
ferrets mustela putorius furo develop symptoms upon influenza infection that resemble those of humans including sneezing body temperature variation and weight loss highly pathogenic strains of influenza a such as h5n1 have the capacity to cause severe illness or death in ferrets the use of ferrets as a model of influenza infection is currently limited by a lack of species-specific immunological reagents interferon gamma ifn-g plays a key role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity and the regulation of th1-type immune responses here we describe the cloning of the full-length cdna for ferret ifn-g multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of other species indicates that the predicted ferret protein shares the highest identity with eurasian badger ifn-g we raised two hybridoma clones expressing monoclonal antibodies against recombinant ferret ifn-g capable of detecting ifn-g protein derived from mitogenstimulated ferret pbmcs by immunoblotting elisa and elispot assay finally an elisa utilizing the ferret-specific antibodies detected elevated levels of ifn-g in serum samples from h3n2 influenza a-infected ferrets
stools from 266 children in four districts of lesotho were examined for viruses by electron microscopy em over a 5-week period eighty one 30.5% of the children shed coronavirus-like particles cvlps shedding was not significantly associated with diarrhea the proportion of children shedding these particles increased with increasing age in one district the prevalence of cvlp shedding 67.9% was at least twice the prevalence in any of the other three districts this was the only district to be sampled during the first week of the study it was shown that the proportion of children shedding cvlps declined during each of the 5 weeks of study the stools of six children who shed cvlps in the early summer of 1984-85 were negative by em 5 months later there was no association between the shedding of pathogenic bacteria or parasites and the presence or absence of cvlps in the stool
salmonella enterica serotype heidelberg is primarily a poultry adapted serotype of salmonella that can also colonize other hosts and cause human disease in this study we compared the genomes of outbreak associated non-outbreak causing salmonella ser heidelberg strains from diverse hosts and geographical regions human outbreak associated strains in this study were from a 2015 multistate outbreak of salmonella ser heidelberg involving 15 states in the united states which originated from bull calves our clinicopathologic examination revealed that cases involving salmonella ser heidelberg strains were predominantly young less than weeks-old dairy calves pre-existing or concurrent disease was found in the majority of the calves detection of salmonella ser heidelberg correlated with markedly increased death losses clinically comparable to those seen in herds infected with s dublin a known serious pathogen of cattle whole genome based single nucleotide polymorphism based analysis revealed that these calf isolates formed a distinct cluster along with outbreak associated human isolates the defining feature of the outbreak associated strains when compared to older isolates of s heidelberg is that all isolates in this cluster contained saf fimbrial genes which are generally absent in s heidelberg the acquisition of several single nucleotide polymorphisms and the gain of saf fimbrial genes may have contributed to the increased disease severity of these salmonella ser heidelberg strains
next-generation sequencing ngs has the potential to transform the discovery of viruses causing unexplained acute febrile illness uafi because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence more generally it has the potential to elucidate the complete human virome including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences we have used ngs to identify rna viruses in the blood of 195 patients with uafi and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy i e no overt signs of illness control individuals all from communities in southeastern nigeria among uafi patients we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses such as hiv-1 hepatitis and lassa virus in our cohort of healthy individuals however we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses these viruses which we call ekpoma virus-1 ekv-1 and ekpoma virus-2 ekv-2 are highly divergent with little identity to each other or other known viruses the most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus tibrovirus and bas-congo virus basv which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever furthermore by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort we find evidence for plos neglected tropical diseases | next-generation sequencing a high-throughput method for sequencing dna and rna has the potential to transform virus discovery because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence we used nextgeneration sequencing to identify rna viruses present in the blood of patients with unexplained fever as well as apparently healthy individuals in a peri-urban community in nigeria we found several well-characterized viruses in the blood of the febrile patients including hiv-1 hepatitis b and c as well as lassa virus we also discovered two novel rhabdoviruses in the blood of two apparently healthy afebrile females which we named ekpoma virus-1 and ekpoma virus-2 rhabdoviruses are distributed globally and include several human pathogens from the genera lyssavirus and vesiculovirus e g rabies chandipura and vesicular stomatitis virus the novel rhabdoviruses identified in this study are most similar to bas-congo virus which was recently identified in an individual with an acute febrile illness furthermore we demonstrate evidence of high levels of previous exposure to the two rhabdoviruses among our larger study population our results suggest that such rhabdovirus infections could be common and may not necessarily cause overt disease the identification of viral nucleic acid sequences in apparently healthy individuals highlights the need for a broader understanding of all viruses infecting humans as we increase efforts to identify viruses causing human disease
this report describes five cases of naturally occurring feline coronavirus enteritis the affected animals aged 2 months to 7 years had a clinical history of intestinal symptoms including diarrhoea or vomiting or both they exhibited variable histological changes in the epithelium of the small intestine ranging from degeneration of single cells and detachment of groups of cells from the villous tips to regenerative processes of the crypt epithelia post-mortem diagnosis was based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen within intestinal epithelial cells and on the electron microscopical demonstration of coronavirus particles in the faeces in addition one animal was immunohistochemically positive for antigens of feline leukaemia virus felv and exhibited intestinal changes consistent with felvassociated enteritis two cats were tested serologically for feline immunodeficiency antibodies with negative results the findings indicate that natural coronavirus infection is a potential cause of severe enteritis in juvenile and adult cats

one of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in rna virus cross-species transmission cst events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale in 2009 the california department of public health reported a dramatic increase .350% in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in humboldt county to better understand the evolution of rabies deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the humboldt outbreak for each sample approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the illumina platform average coverage was 174486and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date 1995 vs 2009 and geographic location northern vs southern a single amino acid change in the g protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the cst event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level as rare variants in the viral population in skunk and fox samples from 1995 these results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change citation borucki mk chen-harris h lao v vanier g wadford da et al 2013 ultra-deep sequencing of intra-host rabies virus populations during cross-species transmission plos negl trop dis 711 e2555
canine parvovirus cpv is a common etiological agent of acute enteritis which occurs globally in domestic and wild carnivores despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines while no specific antiviral therapy for cpv infection exists the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms thus there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of cpv-related disease in this study a cytopathic effect cpe-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen cpv inhibitors from a food and drug administration fda-approved drug library after two rounds of screening seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have >50% cpe inhibition three drugs-nitazoxanide closantel sodium and closantel-with higher anti-cpv effects were further evaluated in f81 cells by absolute pcr quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa the inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the cpv replication cycle and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three cpv variants in addition antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in nitazoxanide-treated f81 cells regardless of cpv infection while closantel sodium-or closantel-treated cells had no proor antiapoptotic effects in conclusion nitazoxanide closantel sodium and closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of cpv since the safety profiles of fda-approved drugs have already been extensively studied these three drugs can potentially become specific and effective anti-cpv drugs

aims-the aim of this study was to develop and demonstrate an approach for describing the diversity of human pathogenic viruses in an environmentally isolated viral metagenome methods and results-in silico bioinformatic experiments were used to select an optimum annotation strategy for discovering human viruses in virome datasets and applied to annotate a class b biosolids virome results from the in silico study indicated that less than 1% errors in virus identification could be achieved when nucleotide-based search programs blastn or tblastx viral genome only databases and sequence reads greater than 200 nt were considered within the 51925 annotated sequences 94 dna and 19 rna sequences were identified as human viruses virus diversity included environmentally transmitted agents such as parechovirus coronavirus adenovirus and aichi virus as well as viruses associated with chronic human infections such as human herpes and hepatitis c viruses conclusions-this study provided a bioinformatic approach for identifying pathogens in a virome dataset and demonstrated the human virus diversity in a relevant environmental sample significance and impact of study-as the costs of next generation sequencing decrease the pathogen diversity described by virus metagenomes will provide an unbiased guide for subsequent cell-culture and quantitative pathogen analyses and ensures that highly enriched and relevant pathogens are not neglected in exposure and risk assessments
emerging pathogens are either new or newly recognized or those that are increasing in incidence and spread since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic the highly pathogenic sars coronavirus sars-cov emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars many patients with sars-cov experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and west nile virus the severity of sars-cov disease increased with age unfortunately successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging immune senescence due to the rapidity of virus emergence technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation we discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human sars-cov has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases in addition we review the evolution epidemiology and pathogenesis of epidemic and zoonotic sars-cov with focus on the development of broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines that protect aged populations from the zoonotic pool
the global vaccine market is diverse while facing a plethora of novel developments genetic modification gm techniques facilitate the design of 'smarter' vaccines for many of the major infectious diseases of humans like aids and malaria but also for most human neoplastic disorders still no vaccines are available it may be speculated that novel gm technologies will significantly contribute to their development while a promising number of studies is conducted on gm vaccines and gm vaccine technologies the contribution of gm technology to newly introduced vaccines on the market is disappointingly limited in this study the field of vector-based gm vaccines is explored data on currently available actually applied and newly developed vectors is retrieved from various sources synthesised and analysed in order to provide an overview on the use of vector-based technology in the field of gm vaccine development while still there are only two vector-based vaccines on the human vaccine market there is ample activity in the fields of patenting preclinical research and different stages of clinical research results of this study revealed that vector-based vaccines comprise a significant part of all gm vaccines in the pipeline this study further highlights that poxviruses and adenoviruses are among the most prominent vectors in gm vaccine development after the approval of the first vectored human vaccine based on a flavivirus vector vaccine vector technology especially based on poxviruses and adenoviruses holds great promise for future vaccine development
south-east asia is a hot spot for emerging zoonotic diseases and bats have been recognized as hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars responsible for acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks thus it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans coronaviruses covs have been reported in bat species from thailand china indonesia taiwan and the philippines however no such work was conducted in cambodia or lao pdr between 2010 and 2013 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries they were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-pcr assay a total of 93 samples 4.7% from 17 genera of bats tested positive sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus αcov and beta-cov βcov respectively the βcovs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human such as sars-cov and mers-cov all coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats family pteropodidae n = 55 clustered with other bat βcovs of lineage d whereas one coronavirus from pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage c of βcovs which also includes the mers-cov αcovs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat αcov sequences previously published a closely related strain of pedv responsible for severe diarrhea in pigs pedv-cov was detected in 2 myotis bats we highlighted the presence and the high diversity of coronaviruses circulating in bats from cambodia and lao pdr three new bat genera and species were newly identified as host of coronaviruses namely macroglossus sp megaerops niphanae and myotis horsfieldii
with very few adjuvants currently being used in marketed human vaccines a critical need exists for novel immunopotentiators and delivery vehicles capable of eliciting humoral cellular and mucosal immunity such crucial vaccine components could facilitate the development of novel vaccines for viral and parasitic infections such as hepatitis hiv malaria cancer etc in this review we discuss clinical trial results for various vaccine adjuvants and delivery vehicles being developed that are approximately nanoscale b1000 nm in size humoral immune responses have been observed for most adjuvants and delivery platforms while only viral vectors iscoms and montanide™ isa 51 and 720 have shown cytotoxic t cell responses in the clinic mf59 and mpl® have elicited th1 responses and virus-like particles non-degradable nanoparticles and liposomes have also generated cellular immunity such vaccine components have also been evaluated for alternative routes of administration with clinical successes reported for intranasal delivery of viral vectors and proteosomes and oral delivery of a vlp vaccine published by elsevier b v
nipah virus niv is a new zoonotic paramyxovirus that emerged in 1998 and is now classified in the genus henipavirus along with the closely related hendra virus hev niv is highly pathogenic in several vertebrate species including humans and the lack of available vaccines or specific treatment restricts it to biosafety level 4 bsl4 containment a serum neutralization test was developed for measuring niv neutralizing antibodies under bsl2 conditions using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv expressing green fluorescent protein gfp and bearing the f and g proteins of niv vsv-niv-gfp the neutralization titers were obtained by counting gfp-expressing cells or by measuring fluorescence the performance of this new assay was compared against the conventional test using live niv with panels of sera from several mammalian species including sera from niv outbreaks experimental infections as well as hev-specific sera the results obtained with the vsv-niv-gfp based test correlated with those obtained using live niv using a 50% reduction in vsv-niv-gfp infected cells as the cut-off for neutralization this new assay demonstrated its potential as an effective tool for detecting niv neutralizing antibodies under bsl2 containment with greater speed sensitivity and safety as compared to the conventional niv serum neutralization test
malaria infection starts with the injection of motile plasmodium sporozoites into the host's skin during a mosquito bite previous studies using the rodent malaria model indicate that the dermal inoculation site may be where sporozoites are most vulnerable to antibodies yet functional in vivo assays with human malaria parasites are lacking here we present the first characterization of p falciparum sporozoites in the skin comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species and investigating whether the environment of its natural host influences p falciparum sporozoite motility using a human skin xenograft model the combined data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages the skin is not a species-specific barrier for plasmodium we observe that p falciparum sporozoites inoculated into mouse skin move with similar speed displacement and duration and enter blood vessels in similar numbers as the rodent parasites thus interventions targeting p falciparum sporozoite migration can be tested in the murine dermis importantly to streamline quantification of sporozoite motility we developed a toolbox allowing for automated detection and tracking of sporozoites in intravital microscopy videos this establishes a platform to test vaccine candidates immunization protocols monoclonal antibodies and drug candidates for their impact on human malaria sporozoites in vivo screening of intervention strategies for in vivo efficacy against pf sporozoites using this new platform will have the potential to validate targets prior to expensive clinical trials
bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses including coronaviruses covs that cause serious disease in humans and agricultural animals these include covs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers porcine epidemic diarrhea ped and severe acute diarrhea syndrome sads bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease these observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several covs in this review we follow the cov outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats we review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor covs without severe disease we speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of covs and factors that enable these viruses to "jump" from bats to other mammals we hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations
transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov are enteropathogenic coronaviruses covs of swine tgev appearance in 1946 preceded identification of pedv 1971 and pdcov 2009 that are considered as emerging covs a spike deletion mutant of tgev associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv prcv is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical since prcv emergence and rapid spread most pigs have become immune to both prcv and tgev which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of tgev in contrast pdcov and pedv are currently expanding their geographic distribution and there are reports on the circulation of tgev-pedv recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses tgev pedv and pdcov cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs most severe in neonatal piglets and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration which can lead to the death of piglets strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge however these viruses display no cross-protection adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated covs recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field
zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global public health and is fueled by globalization the loss of natural habitats and exposure to new hosts for coronaviruses covs broad diversity exists within bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events in this review we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these cov populations for survival amplification and possible emergence in novel hosts

background enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry resulting in considerable economic losses apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases however enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry so their role in enteritis is still unclear the present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses namely astrovirus coronavirus parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011 clinical samples 10 individual faecal swabs/flock were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of astrovirus non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus and 5′ untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus different statistical methods i e the independence chi-square test the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data results overall 137 66.2% 95% ci 59.3-72.6 of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses among the 137 flocks 74 54% 95% ci 45.3-62.6 were positive for one virus whereas 54 39.4% 9 5% ci 31.2-48.1 and 9 6.6% 95% ci 3.1-12.1 were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses respectively no flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied the prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% 95% ci 38.0-52.0 parvovirus 27.5% 95% ci 21.6-34.2 rotavirus 18.8% 95% ci 13.8-24.8 and coronavirus 9.7% 95% ci 6.0-14.5 young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest 82.1% 95% ci71.7-89.8 prevalence of viral infection applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys furthermore our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus conclusions the study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus coronavirus parvovirus and rotavirus infections in polish turkey farms these viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds however the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey
analyses of turkey coronavirus tcov an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus ibv an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens were conducted to determine the adaptive potential and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus strains of tcov that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in ibv with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift following emergence in turkeys tcov diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike this is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses
diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a catastrophic gastrointestinal disease among suckling piglets with high infectivity morbidity and mortality causing huge economic losses to the pig industry in the present study we investigated the different microbiota from the cecal mucosa and cecal contents between healthy and pedv-infected piglets high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed to explore differences the results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by pedv infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level the abundance of pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases including diarrhea was increased the abundance of fusobacterium was 26.71% and 33.91% in cecal mucosa and contents of pedv-infected group respectively whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. the proportion of proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high 24.67% and 22.79% respectively whereas that in the healthy group was 13.13% and 11.34% in the cecal mucosa and contents respectively additionally the proportion of bacteroidetes in the healthy group 29.89% 37.32% was approximately twice that of the pedv-infected group 15.50% 15.39%. "nitrate reduction" "human pathogens diarrhea" "human pathogens gastroenteritis" "nitrite respiration" and "nitrite ammonification" were the enriched functional annotation terms in the pedv-infected groups porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets our findings suggest that determining the intestinal microbiota might provide a promising method to prevent pedv and open a new avenue for future research
over the past 15 years dna vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and chagas disease we review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of dna vaccines against these diseases many studies have validated the concept of using dna vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models the challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy also genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates

background human metapneumovirus hmpv a recently identified virus causes acute respiratory tract infections artis in infants and children however studies on the seroepidemeology of hmpv are very limited in china to assess the seroprevalence of hmpv infection in china we tested a total of 1156 serum specimens for the presence of anti-hmpv igg antibody in children and adults free of acute respiratory illness in beijing china by using hmpv nucleocapsid n protein as an antigen as a control we used the human serum antibody against the n protein of human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv the most important viral agent responsible for aris in children results the seropositive rate for hmpv increased steadily with age from 67% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20 however the rate dropped slightly between 6 mo and 1 yr of age the seropositive rate for hrsv also increased steadily with age from 71% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20 in children aged six months to six years the seropositive rates for the anti-hrsv igg antibody were significantly higher than those for hmpv additionally igg antibody titers to hmpv and hrsv were significantly higher in adults than in young children consistent with the seropositive rates the geometric mean titer of anti-hmpv igg antibody was lower than that of anti-hrsv igg antibody in children aged six months to six years our results indicate that similar to hrsv exposure to hmpv is ubiquitous in the beijing population however the seroprevalence of anti-hmpv igg antibody is lower than that of hrsv in children between six months and six years old which suggests a different number of repeat infections or a different response to infections
we show that a model antigen ovalbumin ova can be chemically conjugated to the exterior of a small heat shock protein shsp cage that has structural similarities to virus-like particles vlps ova-shsp conjugation efficiency was dependent upon the stoichiometry and the length of the small molecule linker utilized and the attachment position on the shsp cage when conjugated ova-shsp was delivered intranasally to naïve mice the resulting immune response to ova was accelerated and intensified and ova-specific igg1 responses were apparent within 5 days after a single immunizing dose illustrating its utility for vaccine development if animals were pretreated with a disparate vlp p22 a non-replicative bacteriophage capsid before ova-shsp conjugate immunization ova-specific igg1 responses were apparent already by 4 days after a single immunizing dose of conjugate in ova-naïve mice additionally the mice pretreated with p22 produced high titer mucosal iga and isotype-switched ova-specific serum igg similarly shsp pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of lung germinal center b cells t follicular helper cells and increased polymeric ig receptor expression priming the lungs for subsequent igg and iga responses to influenza virus challenge thus shsp nanoparticles elicited quick and intense antibody responses and these accelerated responses could similarly be induced to antigen chemically conjugated to the shsp pretreatment of mice with p22 further accelerated the onset of the antibody response to ova-shsp demonstrating the utility of conjugating antigens to vlps for pre- or possibly post-exposure prophylaxis of lung all without the need for adjuvant
to construct a recombinant plasmid pet23a-m the gene encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus membrane protein was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into the expression plasmid pet23a results of restriction endonuclease analysis pcr detection and dna sequencing analysis revealed that the cloned dna sequence was the same as that reported the recombinants were transformed into escherichia c o l i e coil bl21 de3 and induced by isopropyl-13-d-thiogalactopyranoside iptg the expression of 27 kd 1 kd=0 992 1 ku protein was detected by sds-page and pured by metal chelated chromatography results of western-blot showed that this expressed protein could react with antibodies in sera of sars patients during convalescence this provided the basis for the further study on sars virus vaccine and diagnostic agents
the majority of lymphocytes activated at mucosal sites receive instructions to home back to the local mucosa but a portion also seed distal mucosa sites by seeding distal sites with antigen-specific effector or memory lymphocytes the foundation is laid for the animal's mucosal immune system to respond with a secondary response should to this antigen be encountered at this site in the future the common mucosal immune system has been studied quite extensively in rodent models but less so in large animal models such as the pig reasons for this paucity of reported induction of the common mucosal immune system in this species may be that distal mucosal sites were examined but no induction was observed and therefore it was not reported however we suspect that the majority of investigators simply did not sample distal mucosal sites and therefore there is little evidence of immune response induction in the literature it is our hope that more pig immunologists and infectious disease experts who perform mucosal immunizations or inoculations on pigs will sample distal mucosal sites and report their findings whether results are positive or negative in this review we highlight papers that show that immunization/inoculation using one route triggers mucosal immune system induction locally systemically and within at least one distal mucosal site only by understanding whether immunizations at one site triggers immunity throughout the common mucosal immune system can we rationally develop vaccines for the pig and through these works we can gather evidence about the mucosal immune system that may be extrapolated to other livestock species or humans
plant extracts and associated polyphenols are known for their varied health benefits that include antioxidant effects and antimicrobial properties the increasing consumer demand for cost-effective and natural alternatives to chemicallysynthesized antimicrobials and therapeutics that are also sustainable makes the field of phytochemical research rather intriguing and challenging human enteric viruses are increasingly recognized worldwide as significant causes of human disease in adults and children alike in the absence of available vaccines for the human noroviruses plant extracts are gaining popularity for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases research on plant extracts particularly polyphenols derived from fruits for human enteric virus control will be briefly summarized in this article
h9n2 avian influenza viruses sporadically infect humans worldwide these viruses have also contributed internal genes to h5n1 h5n6 h7n9 and h10n8 viruses which have been isolated from humans with infections and are a substantial public health threat to investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the h9n2 virus we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent h9n2 avian influenza virus a/chicken/shandong/416/2016 in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus we generated a mouse-adapted ma virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs caused severe lung damage in mice and induced body weight loss in mice however the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that the transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct the lungs of mice infected with the ma virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis which was not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus these data indicated that the ma virus might evade immune surveillance and changed its replication capacity to increase the viral replication level and pathogenicity our study demonstrates that host factors play an important role in the adaptive evolution of influenza virus in new hosts publisher's note springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations
sapelovirus a sv-a formerly known as porcine sapelovirus as a member of a new genus sapelovirus is known to cause enteritis pneumonia polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders in pigs we have recently identified a23-linked sialic acid on gd1a ganglioside as a functional sv-a receptor rich in the cells of pigs and chickens however the role of gd1a in viral pathogenesis remains elusive here we demonstrated that a korean sv-a strain could induce diarrhoea and intestinal pathology in piglets but not in chicks moreover this korean sv-a strain had mild extra-intestinal tropisms appearing as mild non-suppurative myelitis encephalitis and pneumonia in piglets but not in chicks by real-time reverse transcription rt pcr higher viral rna levels were detected in faecal samples than in sera or extra-intestinal organs from virusinoculated piglets immunohistochemistry confirmed that high viral antigens were detected in the epithelial cells of intestines from virus-inoculated piglets but not from chicks this korean sv-a strain could bind the cultured cell lines originated from various species but replication occurred only in cells of porcine origin these data indicated that this korean sv-a strain could replicate and induce pathology in piglets but not in chicks suggesting that additional porcine-specific factors are required for virus entry and replication in addition this korean sv-a strain is enteropathogenic but could spread to the bloodstream from the gut and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs and tissues these results will contribute to our understanding of sv-a pathogenesis so that efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs and vaccines could be developed in the future sv-a can cause asymptomatic and symptomatic diseases in both field and experimental pigs alexandersen et al 2012 kim et al 2016 . the symptomatic disorders include †these authors contributed equally to this work
examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of different virus families several mechanisms many of which still are poorly understood are at the basis of this phenomenon vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general and for hiv/aids in particular has been little successful certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them for vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus dengue virus and feline immunodeficiency virus it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement ade plays an important role other mechanisms may either in the absence of or in combination with ade be involved consequently vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi- corona- paramyxo- and lentivirus vaccines also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against hiv may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection there may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other the present paper reviews the currently known mechanisms of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis
two hundred and fifteen diarrheic samples from 1 to 7 days old piglets were tested for a panel of enteric pathogens in 19 of the studied farms additional fecal samples from apparently healthy pen-mates were collected and tested for the same panel of infectious agents samples were bacteriologically cultured and tested by pcr for e coli virulence factors genes c perfringens types a and c toxins cpα cpβ cpβ2 and c difficile toxins tcda tcdb moreover rotavirus a rva rotavirus b rvb rotavirus c rvc porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev were also determined by rt-qpcr more than one pathogen could be detected in all of the outbreaks nevertheless rva was the only agent that could be statistically correlated with the outcome of diarrhea for the other viruses and bacteria analyzed significant differences between the diseased pigs and the controls were not found in spite of this the individual analysis of each of the studied farms indicated that other agents such as rvb rvc toxigenic c difficile or pathogenic e coli could play a relevant role in the outbreak of diarrhea in conclusion the large diversity of agent combinations and disease situations detected in neonatal diarrhea outbreaks of this study stand for a more personalized diagnosis and management advice at a farm level
this study analyzed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against hiv-1 using three different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses nsv expressing hiv-1 gag as vaccine vectors rabies virus rabv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv and newcastle disease virus ndv we hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen to this end we primed balb/c mice with each of the nsv-based vectors primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous nsv-gag viruses the magnitude and quality of the gag-specific cd8 + t cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured in addition we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing hiv-1 gag vv-gag thirty-three days after the boost inoculation our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected gag-specific cd8 + t cell recall responses post boost and that ndv-gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of cd8 + t cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used however the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using vv-gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations taken together our data show that nsv vectors can individually stimulate hiv-gag specific cd8 + t cells that are effectively recalled by other nsv vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach these results provide evidence that rabv vsv and ndv can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses
we noticed that countries which applied a universal bcg vaccination policy before 1960 are better protected against sars-cov-2 infection even if immunization ceased a few decades later on the other hand countries which applied a late vaccination policy after 1960 and continue immunization are better protected than those that have stopped it
it was found that antibodies abs against myelin basic protein mbp are the major components of the antibody response in multiple sclerosis ms patients we have recently shown that iggs from sera of ms patients are active in the hydrolysis of mbp however in literature there are no available data concerning possible mbp-hydrolyzing abs in cerebrospinal fluid csf of ms patients we have shown that the average content of iggs in their sera is about 195-fold higher than that in their csf here we have compared for the first time the average content of lambda-and kappa-iggs as well as iggs of four different subclasses igg1-igg4 in csf and sera of ms patients the average relative content of lambda-iggs and kappa -iggs in the case of csfs 8.0 and 92.0% and sera 12.3 and 87.7% are comparable while igg1 igg2 igg3 and igg4 csf -40.4 49.0 8.2 and 2.5% of total iggs respectively and the sera -53.6 36.0 5.6 and 4.8% decreased in different order electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous iggs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the csf proteins on protein g-sepharose and fplc gel filtration we present first evidence showing that iggs from csf efficiently hydrolyze mbp and that their average specific catalytic activity is unpredictably 54-fold higher than that of abs from sera of the same ms patients some possible reasons of these findings are discussed we suggest that anti-mbp abzymes of csf may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and in ms pathogenesis development citation doronin vb parkhomenko ta castellazzi m padroni m pastore m et al 2014 comparison of antibodies hydrolyzing myelin basic protein from the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with multiple sclerosis plos one 99 e107807

background insect-borne diseases could induce severe symptoms in human and clinical signs in animals such as febrility erythra arthralgia and hemorrhagic fever and cause significant economic losses and pose public health threat all over the world the significant advantages of luminex xmap technology are high-throughput high parallel and automation this study aimed to establish a liquid bead array based on luminex xmap technology that was able to simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens methods specific probes and primers to detect the nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens were designed probes were coupled with fluorescent carboxylated microspheres the parameters of the system were optimized including ratio of forward/reverse primers 12 hybridization temperature 50°c and duration 30 min and quantity of pcr product 2 μl the sensitivity and specificity of the system were also evaluated moreover mixed nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens including bluetongue virus epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer coxiella burnetii african swine fever virus west nile fever virus borrelia burgdorferi vesicular stomatitis virus rift valley fever virus ebola virus and schmalenberg's disease virus and 3000 clinical samples were tested for practicability results the optimized detection system showed high sensitivity specificity and reproducibility each probe showed specific fluorescence signal intensity without any cross-hybridization for the other insect-borne pathogens tested which included dengue virus tick-borne encephalitis virus japanese encephalitis virus xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus spotted fever group rickettsiae ehrlichiae and chikungunya virus the limit of detection was 10 copies of target gene insect-borne pathogens were successfully detected among the 3000 clinical samples and the results were consistent with those obtained using gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits conclusions this optimized liquid array detection system was high-throughput and highly specific and sensitive in screening of the insect-borne pathogens it was promising in detection of these pathogens for molecular epidemiological studies
monoclonal antibody mab technology has reached a state of maturity making it possible to rapidly discover and produce fully human mabs which neutralize any given virus in vitro several antibodies have also shown good prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in relevant animal models of viral disease surprisingly only one antiviral mab has been licensed to date it is used to prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus in at-risk infants certain paradigms of mabs prevailing in industry and academia are obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use there is a perception that mabs are much more effective in prophylactic than therapeutic use offer limited breadth of protection against different viral strains are prone to select neutralization escape variants and need to be given in high doses which are still comparatively costly to manufacture based on a review of the literature and our own data we propose that by combining two or more noncompeting neutralizing antibodies viral escape can effectively be controlled and in case of synergistic action of the mabs it may be possible to significantly reduce the total antibody concentration required for protection the combination of mabs with specific antiviral drugs has the potential to expand their use from pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis to therapy of acute and chronic viral infections
in addition to classical virus isolation in cell culture the molecular detection of new virus variants by pcr techniques allows broader epidemiological insights into the world of viral pathogens for the detection of hantaviruses -zoonotic viruses leading to fever and organ failure in humans -we developed a genus-wide nested rt-pcr format which enables the discovery of new members within this virus genus the methodological approach allowed the demonstration of first hantaviruses from africa and revealed new hantavirus reservoir hosts as shrews moles and bats
nipah virus is a broadly tropic and highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus in the genus henipavirus whose natural reservoirs are several species of pteropus fruit bats nipah virus has repeatedly caused outbreaks over the past decade associated with a severe and often fatal disease in humans and animals here a new ferret model of nipah virus pathogenesis is described where both respiratory and neurological disease are present in infected animals severe disease occurs with viral doses as low as 500 tcid 50 within 6 to 10 days following infection the underlying pathology seen in the ferret closely resembles that seen in nipah virus infected humans characterized as a widespread multisystemic vasculitis with virus replicating in highly vascular tissues including lung spleen and brain with recoverable virus from a variety of tissues using this ferret model a cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibody m102.4 targeting the henipavirus g glycoprotein was evaluated in vivo as a potential therapeutic agent all ferrets that received m102.4 ten hours following a high dose oral-nasal nipah virus challenge were protected from disease while all controls died this study is the first successful post-exposure passive antibody therapy for nipah virus using a human monoclonal antibody
since discovering the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov as a causative agent of severe respiratory illness in the middle east in 2012 serological testing has been conducted to assess antibody responses in patients and to investigate the zoonotic reservoir of the virus although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for mers diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories competitive elisa celisa in which a labeled monoclonal antibody mab competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner in this study novel mabs against the spike protein of mers-cov were produced and characterized one of these mabs was used to develop a celisa the celisa detected mers-cov-specific antibodies in sera from mers-cov-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of mers-cov the mab-based celisa was validated using sera from ethiopian dromedary camels relative to the neutralization test the celisa detected mers-cov-specific antibodies in 66 ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100% respectively the celisa and neutralization test results correlated well pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.71-0.76 depending on the celisa serum dilution this celisa may be useful for mers epidemiological investigations on mers-cov infection http//dx

the objective was to describe the probability of cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst shedding at different magnitudes of exposure the pattern of fecal shedding over time and factors affecting fecal shedding in dairy calves within the first 24 h of life 36 calves were experimentally challenged with c parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure 1×10 3 1×10 4 1×10 5 and 1× 10 6 oocysts and 7 control calves were sham dosed fecal shedding occurred in 33 91.7 % experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves there was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure 1×10 3 oocysts shed less than the other three groups at higher magnitudes of exposure there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding there was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf i e the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding the fewer oocysts that were shed the pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear the number of oocysts increased with time reached a peak and declined therefore the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding
neospora caninum is widely distributed in the world and this parasite is one of the major causes of abortion in cattle dogs and coyotes are definitive hosts of n caninum and several species of domestic and wild animals are intermediate hosts dogs can become infected by the ingestion of tissues containing cysts and then excrete oocysts it is not yet known whether sporulated oocysts are able to induce a patent infection in dogs i e a shedding of n caninum oocysts in feces the objective of this study was to experimentally examine the infection of dogs by sporulated oocysts the oocysts used in the experiment were obtained by feeding dogs with brain of buffaloes bubalus bubalis positive for anti-n caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test ifat ≥200 oocysts shed by these dogs were confirmed to be n caninum by molecular methods and by bioassay in gerbils and sporulated n caninum oocysts were used for the oral infection of four dogs the dogs were 8 weeks old and negative for antibodies to n caninum and toxoplasma gondii dogs 1 and 4 received an inoculum of 10000 sporulated oocysts each dog 2 an inoculum of 5000 sporulated oocysts and dog 3 received 1000 sporulated oocysts of n caninum the total feces excreted by these dogs were collected and examined daily for a period of 30 days no oocysts were found in their feces the dogs were monitored monthly for a 6-month period to observe a possible seroconversion and when this occurred the animals were eliminated from the experiment dogs 1 and 4 seroconverted 1 month after the infection with titer in the ifat of 1600 and 800 respectively the other two dogs presented no seroconvertion during the 6-month period dogs 1 and 2 were euthanized 180 days after infection and were examined for the detection of n caninum in tissues brain muscle lymph node liver lung heart and bone marrow by immunohistochemistry and pcr with negative results in both techniques bioassay in gerbils with brain of these dogs was also performed and again the results were negative in conclusion dogs infected with sporulated oocysts of n caninum were not able to shed oocysts in feces however a higher dose of infection stimulated the production of antibodies against n caninum in the dogs
human rotaviruses represent a major cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children the limited impact of oral vaccines on global estimates of rotavirus mortality and the suboptimal use of oral rehydration justify the need for alternative prophylactic and therapeutic strategies especially for immunocompromised hosts the protective effects of colostrum-the first milk produced during the initial 24 to 48 h after parturition-are well documented in the literature in particular the ingestion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum has been proposed as an alternative preventive approach against human rotavirus gastroenteritis although the immunization of pregnant cows with human rotavirus boosts the release of specific immunoglobulin g in bovine colostrum it raises regulatory and safety issues in this study we demonstrated that the conventional bovine rotavirus vaccine is sufficient to enhance the anti-human rotavirus protective efficacy of bovine colostrum thus providing a conservative approach to produce hyperimmune bovine colostrum making it exploitable as a functional food
swine influenza viruses siv regularly cause significant disease in pigs worldwide since there is no causative treatment of siv we tested if probiotic enterococcus e faecium ncimb 10415 or zinc zn oxide as feed supplements provide beneficial effects upon siv infection in piglets seventy-two weaned piglets were fed three different diets containing either e faecium or different levels of zn 2500 ppm zn high 50 ppm zn low . half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly vac twice with an inactivated trivalent siv vaccine while all piglets were then infected intranasally with h3n2 siv significantly higher weekly weight gains were observed in the e faecium group before virus infection and piglets in zn high and e faecium groups gained weight after infection while those in the control group zn low lost weight using elisa we found significantly higher h3n2-specific antibody levels in the e faecium+vac group 2 days before and at the day of challenge infection as well as at 4 and 6 days after challenge infection higher hemagglutination inhibition hi titers were also observed in the zn high +vac and e faecium+vac groups at 0 1 and 4 days after infection however there were no significant differences in virus shedding and lung lesions between the dietary groups using flow cytometry analysis significantly higher activated t helper cells and cytotoxic t lymphocyte percentages in the pbmcs were detected in the zn high and e faecium groups at single time points after infection compared to the zn low control group but no prolonged effect was found in the bal cells no influence of dietary supplementation on immune cell percentages could be detected our results suggest that feeding high doses of zinc oxide and particularly e faecium could beneficially influence humoral immune responses after vaccination and recovery from siv infection but not affect virus shedding and lung pathology
the aim of this study was to examine the incidence of clostridioides previously clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens in the feces of diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs also the presence of other common canine enteropathogens was examined toxigenic c difficile and c perfringens positive for the netf-encoding gene netf were detected in 11 11.9% and seven 7.6% diarrheic dogs respectively three dogs were diagnosed simultaneously with toxigenic c difficile and netf-positive c perfringens among other enteropathogens giardia sp was the most common agent detected in dogs positive for toxigenic c difficile or netf-positive c perfringens the results suggest that c difficile and c perfringens occur more frequently as a primary cause of diarrhea
background middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged in 2012 causing severe acute respiratory disease and pneumonia with 44% mortality among 136 cases to date design of vaccines to limit the virus spread or diagnostic tests to track newly emerging strains requires knowledge of antigenic and serologic relationships between mers-cov and other covs methods using synthetic genomics and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons vrps expressing spike and nucleocapsid proteins from mers-cov and other human and bat covs we characterize the antigenic responses using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serologic responses using neutralization assays against 2 mers-cov isolates in comparison with those of other human and bat covs results serologic and neutralization responses against the spike glycoprotein were primarily strain specific with a very low level of cross-reactivity within or across subgroups cov n proteins within but not across subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with mers-cov isolates our findings were validated using a convalescent-phase serum specimen from a patient infected with mers-cov na 01 and human antiserum against sars-cov human cov nl63 and human cov oc43 conclusions vaccine design for emerging covs should involve chimeric spike protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across subgroups to reduce immune pathology and a diagnostic platform should include a panel of nucleocapsid and spike proteins from phylogenetically distinct covs
mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses covs and their hosts including human beings for thousands of years before 2003 two human covs hcovs were known to cause mild illness such as common cold the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and lifethreatening an hcov infection could be the emergence of sars-cov-2 in central china at the end of 2019 has thrusted covs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister sars-cov hcov infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of hcovs would serve us well most hcovs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic the intermediate reservoir hosts of some hcovs are also known identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases investigating cov-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on cov pathogenesis in humans in this review we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven hcovs with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission importantly we compare and contrast the different hcovs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination the current cov disease 2019 covid-19 epidemic is discussed in this context in addition the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted
pb10 igg 1 a monoclonal antibody mab directed against an immunodominant epitope on the enzymatic subunit rta of ricin toxin rt has been shown to passively protect mice and non-human primates from an aerosolized lethal-dose rt challenge however it was recently demonstrated that the therapeutic efficacy of pb10 igg1 is significantly improved when co-administered with a second mab sylh3 targeting rt's binding subunit rtb here we report that the pb10/sylh3 cocktail is also superior to pb10 alone when used as a pre-exposure prophylactic prep in a mouse model of intranasal rt challenge the benefit of the pb10/sylh3 cocktail prompted us to engineer a humanized igg1 version of sylh3 husylh3 the hupb10/husylh3 cocktail proved highly efficacious in the mouse model thereby opening the door to future testing in non-human primates we described a bipartite humanized monoclonal antibody cocktail with potent neutralizing activity against ricin toxin
a method is described for in vitro studies of viral humoral immune responses in the pig after oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen for the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with uv-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells asc and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with elisaspot using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen and elisa tests respectively according to the ig isotype the results showed a close relationship between asc numbers and secreted antibody titres the best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak with a maximum occurring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the iga response appearing earlier than the igg this methodology which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level may permit studies on the mechanisms of ig isotype regulation extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig
vaccination with a live bivalent vaccine of newcastle disease virus ndv and infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a routine practice in poultry industry in china this study was designed to evaluate ginseng stem-leaf saponins gsls in combination with selenium se for their adjuvant effect on the immune response to vaccination against ndv and ibv in chickens a live bivalent vaccine of ndv and ibv was diluted in saline solution containing gsls or se or both and used to immunize chickens via a intraocular-andintranasal route results showed that gsls promoted significantly higher ndv-and ibv-specific antibody responses with the highest antibody response detected in gsls-se group the increased antibody was capable of neutralizing ndv and ibv in addition gsls-se enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and production of ifn-γ and il-4 more importantly gsls-se was found to promote early production and prolong the duration of the antibody responses in order to improve the efficacy of vaccination in chicken flocks the diluent containing gsls-se deserves further studies to evaluate its effect on other chicken vaccines

background porcine epidemic diarrhea ped is a syndrome that is characterized by rapidly spreading watery diarrhea affecting pigs of all ages but with major effects on suckling piglets the disease as well as the causative alphacoronavirus the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv was first described in europe in the 1970s and since then has spread over many asian and american countries where it recently led to devastating effects on swine health and pork industry while the disease was seldom reported in europe within the last few decades a few recent reports re-emergence of ped in german pig farms the hitherto isolated german strain seems to be closely related to a low pathogenic pedv variant from the usa this case report describes the first detection of pedv in austria case presentation reduced feed uptake and occasional diarrhea were observed in december 2014 in a group of fattening pigs kept on an austrian swine farm the concerned pigs had been recently purchased from germany within a few weeks diarrhea became apparent also in pigs of austrian origin which were kept in a different stable on the same farm gastrointestinal symptoms among fattening pigs were generally mild quickly resolving and did not lead to death pedv rna was identified by rt-qpcr in pooled feces and serum and pedv antibodies were detectable in serum in both groups of pigs phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete pedv spike gene shows that the austrian pedv strain is highly similar to other strains involved in recent outbreaks in western and central europe conclusion this is the first report demonstrating the presence of pedv in austria the virus was probably introduced by purchasing piglets from a german source which underlines the significance of trans-boundary animal trade for the distribution of highly contagious diseases such as ped
a systemic disease of domestic ferrets characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation was first recognized in europe and the united states in 2002 the disease closely resembled feline infectious peritonitis and subsequently has been shown to be associated with ferret systemic coronavirus frscv a definitive laboratory diagnosis of this disease is typically based on a combination of immunohistochemistry ihc and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests to detect frscv in granulomatous lesions in 2010 this feline infectious peritonitis-like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in japan and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to ihc this report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to japanese veterinary hospitals both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by ihc in 1 case for which unfixed tissues were available frscv rna was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues
although porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov is a significant pandemic threat in the swine population and has caused significant economic losses information regarding the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with pdcov is scarce hence the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with pdcov was assessed after challenge and rechallenge after the first challenge obvious diarrhea and viral shedding developed successively in all pigs in the four inoculation dose groups from 3 to 14 days postinfection dpi and all pigs recovered no clinical symptoms or viral shedding by 21 dpi all pigs in the four groups exhibited significantly increased pdcov-specific igg iga and virus-neutralizing vn antibody ab titers and ifn-γ levels in the serum after the first challenge all pigs were completely protected against rechallenge at 21 dpi the serum levels of pdcov-specific igg iga and vn abs increased further after rechallenge notably the ifn-γ level declined continuously after 7 dpi in addition the levels of pdcov-specific igg iga and vn abs in saliva increased significantly after rechallenge and correlated well with the serum ab titers furthermore the appearance of clinical symptoms of pdcov infection in conventionally weaned pigs was delayed with reduced inoculation doses in summary the data presented here offer important reference information for future pdcov animal infection and vaccineinduced immunoprotection experiments porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov a member of the genus deltacoronavirus family coronaviridae order nidovirales is a newly isolated and identified virus causing watery diarrhea vomiting and dehydration in pigs of different ages and breeds especially newborn piglets . since first
recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group a streptococcus gas combo5 is a non-m protein-based vaccine that provides protection against gas skin infection in mice and reduces the severity of pharyngitis in nonhuman primates however combo5 with the addition of aluminum hydroxide alum as an adjuvant failed to protect against invasive gas infection of mice here we show that formulation of combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin qs21 significantly improves protective efficacy even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific igg antibody titers including alum detailed characterization of combo5 formulated with smq adjuvant a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a tlr4 agonist and qs21 showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in igg subclasses generated following immunization with an absence of gas opsonizing antibodies smq but not alum generated strong interleukin-6 il-6 gamma interferon ifn-␥ and tumor necrosis alpha tnf-␣ responses this work highlights the importance of adjuvant selection for non-m protein-based gas vaccines to optimize immune responses and protective efficacy importance availability of a group a streptococcus vaccine remains an unmet public health need here we tested different adjuvant formulations to improve the protective efficacy of non-m protein vaccine combo5 in an invasive disease model we show that novel adjuvants can dramatically shape the type of immune response developed following immunization with combo5 and significantly improve protection in addition protection afforded by combo5 is not mediated by opsonizing antibodies believed to be the main correlate of protection against gas infections overall this report highlights the importance of adjuvant selection in raising protective immune responses against gas invasive infection adjuvants that can provide a more balanced th1/th2-type response may be required to optimize protection of gas vaccines particularly those based on non-m protein antigens g roup a streptococcus gas is a bacterial pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations mild common infections include pharyngitis and impetigo while more-serious infections such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis are relatively rare and yet life-threatening conditions post-citation rivera-hernandez t rhyme ms cork aj jones s segui-perez c brunner l richter j petrovsky n lawrenz m goldblatt d collin n walker mj 2020 vaccine-induced th1-type response protects against invasive group a streptococcus infection in the absence of opsonizing antibodies mbio 11e00122-20
viral infections are an important and often unrecognized component of disease in immunocompromised patients the diagnosis and management of viral infections have expanded largely because of new quantitative molecular diagnostic assays well-recognized pathogens such as herpes simplex virus hsv cytomegalovirus cmv and respiratory viruses have been joined by newly recognized pathogens such as bk virus human herpesvirus-6 hhv-6 and human metapneumovirus in this highly susceptible patient population the role of epstein-barr virus ebv and human herpesvirus-8 hhv-8 in lymphoproliferative diseases also continue to be clarified as a result the management of viral infections in patients with hematologic malignancies continues to be a growing challenge for the clinician
background h3n2 influenza viruses circulating in humans and european pigs originate from the pandemic a/hong kong/68 virus because of slower antigenic drift in swine the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing it remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross-protection between recent human and swine h3n2 influenza viruses objectives we examined whether prior infection of pigs with an old or a more recent human h3n2 virus protected against a european swine h3n2 virus . genetic and antigenic relationships between sw/gent/08 and a selection of human h3n2 viruses were also assessed results after challenge with sw/gent/08 all challenge controls had high virus titers in the entire respiratory tract at 3 days postchallenge and nasal virus excretion for 5-6 days prior infection with sw/gent/08 or a/vic/75 offered complete virological protection against challenge pigs previously inoculated with a/wis/05 showed similar virus titers in the respiratory tract as challenge controls but the mean duration of nasal shedding was 1á3 days shorter unlike sw/gent/08-and a/vic/75-inoculated pigs a/wis/05-inoculated pigs lacked cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/gent/08 before challenge but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge cross-protection and serological responses correlated with genetic and antigenic differences conclusions infection immunity to a recent human h3n2 virus confers minimal cross-protection against a european swine h3n2 virus we discuss our findings with regard to the recent zoonotic infections of humans in the united states with a swine-origin h3n2 variant virus please cite this paper as qiu et al 2013 prior infection of pigs with a recent human h3n2 influenza virus confers minimal cross-protection against a european swine h3n2 virus
astrovirus infections cause gastroenteritis in mammals and have been identi fi ed as causative agents of diverse pathologies in birds such as hepatitis in ducks and poult enteritis mortality syndrome pems which causes enteritis and thymic and bursal atrophy in turkeys human astroviruses are recognized as the second leading cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis worldwide eight traditional astrovirus serotypes have been identi fi ed in humans but recently novel astrovirus strains isolated from humans have been associated with diseases other than gastroenteritis herein we summarize our current knowledge of the astrovirus life cycle though there are gaps in our understanding of astrovirus replication similarities can be drawn from picornaviridae and caliciviridae virus families there are however unique characteristics of the astrovirus life cycle including intracellular proteolytic processing of viral particles by cellular caspases which has been shown to be required for the maturation and exit of viral progeny
high-frequency alleles and/or co-occurring human leukocyte antigen hla alleles across loci appear to be more important than individual alleles because they might be markers of disease risk that have clinical value as biomarkers for targeted screening or the development of new therapies to better elucidate the major histocompatibility complex background and to facilitate the experimental use of cynomolgus macaques mafa-b mafa-dqb1 and mafa-drb alleles were characterized and their combinations were investigated from 30 macaques of vietnamese origin by cloning and sequencing a total of 48 mafa-b 22 mafa-dqb1 and 42 mafa-drb alleles were detected in this study respectively in addition two mafa-dqb1 and eight mafa-drb alleles represented novel sequences that had not been documented in earlier studies our results also showed that the macaque from vietnam might be valuable because ͼ30% of the test animals possessed mafa-drb*w304 30% and -dqb1*0616 30%. we report that the combination of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and ii alleles including the combination of drb3*0403-drb*w304 drb1*1013-drb*w304 and mafa-b*0070101-drb*w304 which was in 17% 13% and 13% of the animals respectively interesting more than two mafa-dqb1 alleles detected in one animal in this study suggest that mafa-dqb1 like mafa-drb might be a duplication in the chromosome which have ever been documented in cynomolgus monkeys but has not yet been observed in rhesus macaques or other primates our results for the high frequency of commonly co-occurring mhc alleles across loci in a cohort of the vietnamese cynomolgus macaque emphasized the value of this species as a model for biomedical research ᭧
enteric viruses play an important role in the brazilian poultry industry due to the economic impact of resulting low yields of broilers layers and breeders the most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in brazil include fowl adenovirus of group i fadv-i chicken parvovirus chpv chicken astrovirus castv avian nephritis virus anv infectious bronchitis virus ibv avian reovirus areo and avian rotavirus artv the aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven brazilian states corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017 this was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds clinical signs and geographical distribution using polymerase chain reaction pcr and reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr techniques twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems stunting syndrome decreases in egg and meat production increased mortality and respiratory signs fadv-i chpv castv anv and artv were mostly detected in young broilers in contrast with ibv which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age these results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent
background approximately 30% of children worldwide are infected with gastrointestinal parasites depending on the species parasites can disrupt intestinal bacterial microbiota affecting essential vitamin biosynthesis methods stool samples were collected from 37 asymptomatic children from a previous cross-sectional argentinian study a multi-parallel real-time quantitative pcr was implemented for ascaris lumbricoides ancylostoma duodenale necator americanus strongyloides stercoralis trichuris trichiura cryptosporidium spp entamoeba histolytica and giardia duodenalis in addition whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted for bacterial microbiota on all samples and analyzed using livermore metagenomic analysis toolkit and diamond software separate analyses were carried out for uninfected giardia-only giardia + helminth co-infections and helminth-only groups for giardia-only infected children compared to uninfected children dna sequencing data showed a decrease in microbiota biodiversity that correlated with increasing giardia burden and was statistically significant using shannonʼs alpha diversity giardia-only > 1 fg/µl 2.346 non-infected group 3.253 p = 0.0317 an increase in diversity was observed for helminth-only infections with a decrease in diversity for giardia + helminth co-infections p = 0.00178 in giardia-only infections microbiome taxonomy changed from firmicutes towards increasing proportions of prevotella with the degree of change related to the intensity of infection compared to uninfected p = 0.0317 the abundance of prevotella bacteria was decreased in the helminths-only group but increased for giardia + helminth co-infections p = 0.0262 metagenomic analysis determined cobalamin synthesis was decreased in the giardia > 1 fg/µl group compared to both the giardia < 1 fg/µl and the uninfected group p = 0.0369 giardia + helminth group also had a decrease in cobalamin cbim genes from helminth-only infections p = 0.000754 the study results may provide evidence for an effect of parasitic infections enabling the permissive growth of anaerobic bacteria such as prevotella suggesting an altered capacity of vitamin b12 cobalamin biosynthesis and potential impact on growth and development in children .

bovine coronavirus bcov is associated with severe diarrhea in calves winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory diseases in cattle of all ages this study aimed to investigate the relationship between white blood cell counts and haptoglobin hp and serum amyloid a saa levels in post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by bcov and those that recovered from diarrhea blood and fecal samples were collected twice from the same animals 17 postweaned calves with diarrhea first and 15 post-weaned calves that recovered from diarrhea second real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that all 17 fecal samples from post-weaned calves with diarrhea and one out of 15 from diarrhea-recovered calves were positive for bcov and negative for cryptosporidium spp escherichia coli k99 salmonella spp bovine rotavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus no eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method in comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea in diarrhea-recovered calves the lymphocyte count was significantly higher p = 0.018 and the monocyte count was significantly lower p = 0.001 however the number of monocytes was still high post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher hp concentration p < 0.001 compared with diarrhea-recovered calves the results indicated that increased hp concentration and monocytosis but not saa may be associated with diarrhea caused by bcov the present study suggests that the monitoring of hp concentration and monocyte count is useful in the diagnosis of post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by bcov in this field
to explore the possibility of developing a vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev infection a recombinant swinepox virus rspv-sa expressing a tgev protective antigen has been constructed immune responses and protection efficacy of the vaccination vector were assessed in both mice and pig models an indirect elisa assay suggested that when mice were vaccinated with rspv-sa the level of igg against tgev was enhanced dramatically the cytokine assays were employed and the results indicated that both the th1-type and th2-type cytokine levels raised after vaccination with rspv-sa in mice models results from the passive immunity protection test of new born piglets demonstrated that the recombinant live-vector vaccine rspv-sa could 100% protect piglets from the spv infection and there was no significant clinical symptom in the rspv-sa treatment group during this experiment the data suggest that the novel recombinant swinepox virus is a potential vaccine against tgev infection
this study was conducted to assess the effect of colostrum quality and quantity on cryptosporidium spp calf diarrhoea in an intensive dairy cattle farm in greece faecal samples were collected from 100 dairy calves randomly selected and born during all 4 seasons march 2015 to may 2016 of the year in total 71% of the selected calves were positive for cryptosporidium spp oocysts the statistical analysis revealed influence of colostrum quality on faecal score linear regression showed that the colostrum quantity during the first day of life was negatively associated with the number of cryptosporidium spp oocysts in faeces during multivariable analysis the variables representing the quality of colostrum and the season of the calf's birth were identified as confounders cryptosporidium spp is a common pathogen participating in neonatal calf diarrhoea colostrum management and season influence the number of cryprosporidium spp oocysts and faecal consistency the above findings demonstrate novel risk factors that should be included in the strategic approaches to control cryptosporidiosis in newborn calves
background group a rotaviruses rva are the main cause of neonatal calve diarrhea ncd in morocco in this study we isolated rva strains from ncd clinical samples in order to support rva disease control in morocco this isolation process constitutes a first step toward vaccine development methods thirteen fecal samples were obtained from calves with a single episode of neonate calf diarrhea at three different dairies and two samples were collected from field during a severe ncd outbreak diagnosis of rva infection was based on fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test and further evaluated for their hemagglutination ha activity rva isolation was carried out on ma104 cells after inoculates were treated with different concentrations of trypsin tpck all rva isolates were confirmed by lsi vetmax ™ triplex ruminant rotavirus & coronavirus real-time pcr kit g and p typing were determined by direct sequencing of the vp4 and vp7 amplicons results rva isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages 60 % and was properly depended on ha activity and trypsin treatment of inoculates the first sign of cpe detected consisted of increased cell granularity obscure cell boundaries cell rounding and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells at lower tpck concentration 3-10 μg/inoculum no changes at the cellular level were observed while cells activated with 25-30 μg of trypsin/inoculums they degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced appreciable changes in cell's morphology were detected with optimal trypsin concentration of 15-20 μg trypsin/inoculums data from qrt-pcr confirmed that unsuccessful cultivations have no-ct and all nine isolates have ct values ranged between 12.17 and 24.69 analysis sequencing revealed that field isolates were of g6 p serotype and isolates from the dairy ncd samples were of g10 p serotype to our knowledge this is the first study in morocco which reports the circulation of g10p in ncd on dairy farms and g6p in the field our study constitutes a crucial and a necessary step allowing preventive and veterinary medicine to support rva disease controls in the country
immune responses to the infectious bronchitis virus ibv nucleocapsid protein were studied using a recombinant-dna expression product in mice a lymphocyte proltferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to ibv were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein next we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to ibv in chickens chickens were primed with nucleocapsidprotein and subsequently boosted with inactivated ibv strain m41 proltferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres finally an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live ibv was observed these results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsidprotein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken
objectives canine infectious respiratory disease cird is a disease of multifactorial aetiology where multiple pathogens act sequentially or synergistically to cause disease it is common within large dog populations such as those in re-homing or training kennels vaccines are vital in its management of cird but they often fail to prevent disease recently a number of novel pathogens have been identified in cird outbreaks and represent new targets for vaccination key findings innate immune responses provide a vital first line of defence against the infectious agents involved in the development of cird once breeched adaptive mucosal immunity is necessary to prevent infection and limit spread current vaccines target only a few of the agents involved in cird evidence from the limited amount of published data indicates that although vaccinating against these agents reduces infection rates duration of shedding and severity of disease it does not induce sterilising immunity and this has important consequences for the management of the disease and the future of cird vaccine development summary in the process of considering the development of novel cird vaccines this paper focuses on the immunological mechanisms that provide protection for the respiratory tract the current recommendations for canine vaccination and the challenges surrounding existing cird vaccines and their future development bs_bs_banner and pharmacology journal of pharmacy review
while bats are often viewed as carriers of infectious disease agents little research has been conducted on the effects these potential pathogens may have on the bat populations themselves the southern bent-winged bat miniopterus orianae bassanii is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern australia population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years but the reasons for this are unclear as part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats miniopterus orianae oceanensis from three different locations the eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations at least six novel herpesviruses five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus were identified the prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats 44% 51/ 116 compared to southern bent-winged bats 27% 95/351 although this varied across the locations and sampling periods adenoviruses and a range of different rna viruses lyssaviruses filoviruses coronaviruses and henipaviruses were also tested for but not detected the detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bentwinged bat the detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses
the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars has been identified as sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov but the prophylactic treatment of sars-cov is still under investigation we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated n-terminal fragment of the sars-cov spike s gene from −45 to 1469 designated ad-s n which encoded a truncated s protein 490 amino-acid residues a part of 672 amino-acid s1 subunit and investigated whether this construct could induce effective immunity against sars-cov in wistar rats rats were immunized either subcutaneously or intranasally with ad-s n once a week for three consecutive weeks our results showed that all of the immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the sars-cov spike protein and the sera of immunized rats showed strong capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in vitro histopathological examination did not find evident side effects in the immunized animals these results indicate that an adenoviral-based vaccine carrying an n-terminal fragment of the spike gene is able to elicit strong sars-cov-specific humoral immune responses in rats and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against sars-cov infection
the study of human-specific infectious agents has been hindered by the lack of optimal small animal models more recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents the introduction of a targeted mutation in the il2 receptor common gamma chain gene il2rg null in mice already deficient in t and b cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice these humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 hiv-1 and other human-specific infectious agents however there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents this is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice including i modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity which impedes human cell engraftment ii genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function iii and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols the development of "next generation" humanized mouse models continues to provide exciting opportunities for the establishment of robust small animal models to study the pathogenesis of human-specific infectious agents as well as for testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents and experimental vaccines
clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves the organism and its toxins tcda and tcdb respectively were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive however toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates salmonella sp was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves but large numbers of e coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals prevalence rates for coronavirus and cryptosporidium sp were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic but rates of detection of rotavirus and giardia sp were more nearly equal between groups lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria large gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with c difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture toxins were found throughout the colon purified toxins a and b individually and conjointly caused comparable lesions as well as fluid accumulation in ligated intestinal loops our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others and add strength to a working hypothesis that c difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves it seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism #

the clinical course of tick-borne encephalitis tbe a disease caused by tbe virus ranges from asymptomatic or mild influenza-like infection to severe debilitating encephalitis or encephalomyelitis despite the medical importance of this disease some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood in particular the basis of the disease severity is largely unknown methods tbe virus growth neutralizing antibody response key cytokine and chemokine mrna production and changes in mrna levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells in brain were measured in mice with different susceptibilities to tbe virus infection showing different severities of the infection in relation to the host genetic background was developed after subcutaneous inoculation of tbe virus balb/c mice showed medium susceptibility to the infection sts mice were resistant and ccs-11 mice were highly susceptible the resistant sts mice showed lower and delayed viremia lower virus production in the brain and low cytokine/chemokine mrna production but had a strong neutralizing antibody response the most sensitive strain ccs-11 failed in production of neutralizing antibodies but exhibited strong cytokine/chemokine mrna production in the brain after intracerebral inoculation all mouse strains were sensitive to the infection and had similar virus production in the brain but sts mice survived significantly longer than ccs-11 mice these two strains also differed in the expression of key cytokines/chemokines particularly interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10/cxcl10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mcp-1/ccl2 in the brain our data indicate that the genetic control is an important factor influencing the clinical course of tbe high neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality but high expression of various cytokines/chemokines during tbe can mediate immunopathology and be associated with more severe course of the infection and increased fatality
little is known about the neutralizing epitopes in turkey coronavirus tcov the spike s protein gene of tcov was divided into 10 fragments to identify the antigenic region containing neutralizing epitopes the expression and antigenicity of s fragments was confirmed by immunofluorescence antibody ifa assay using an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody or anti-tcov serum polyclonal antibodies raised against expressed s1 amino acid position 1 to 573 from start codon of s protein 4f/4r 482-678 6f/6r 830-1071 or mod4f/epi4r 476-520 s fragment recognized native s1 protein and tcov in the intestines of tcov-infected turkey embryos anti-tcov serum reacted with recombinant 4f/4r 6f/6r and mod4f/epi4r in a western blot the results of a virus neutralization assay indicated that the carboxyl terminal region of the s1 protein mod4f/epi4r or the combined carboxyl terminal s1 and amino terminal s2 protein 4f/ 4r possesses the neutralizing epitopes while the s2 fragment 6f/6r contains antigenic epitopes but not neutralizing epitopes
a cytopathic virus was isolated using madin-darby bovine kidney mdbk cells from lung tissue of alpaca that died of a severe respiratory infection to identify the virus the infected cell culture supernatant was enriched for virus particles and a generic pcr-based method was used to amplify potential viral sequences genomic sequence data of the alpaca isolate was obtained and compared with sequences of known viruses the new alpaca virus sequence was most similar to recently designated enterovirus species f previously bovine enterovirus bevs viruses that are globally prevalent in cattle although they appear not to cause significant disease because bovine enteroviruses have not been previously reported in u s alpaca we suspect that this type of infection is fairly rare and in this case appeared not to spread beyond the original outbreak the capsid sequence of the detected virus had greatest homology to enterovirus f type 1 indicating that the virus should be considered a member of serotype 1 but the virus had greater homology in 2a protease sequence to type 3 suggesting that it may have been a recombinant identifying pathogens that infect a new host species for the first time can be challenging as the disease in a new host species may be quite different from that in the original or natural host the pathogen may not be suspected based on the clinical presentation delaying diagnosis although this virus replicated in mdbk cells existing standard culture and molecular methods could not identify it in this case a highly sensitive generic pcr-based pathogen-detection method was used to identify this pathogen
the jamaican fruit bat artibeus jamaicensis is one of the most common bats in the tropical americas it is thought to be a potential reservoir host of tacaribe virus an arenavirus closely related to the south american hemorrhagic fever viruses we performed transcriptome sequencing and annotation from lung kidney and spleen tissues using 454 and illumina platforms to develop this species as an animal model more than 100000 contigs were assembled with 25000 genes that were functionally annotated of the remaining unannotated contigs 80% were found within bat genomes or transcriptomes annotated genes are involved in a broad range of activities ranging from cellular metabolism to genome regulation through ncrnas reciprocal blast best hits yielded 8785 sequences that are orthologous to mouse rat cattle horse and human species tree analysis of sequences from 2378 loci was used to achieve 95% bootstrap support for the placement of bat as sister to the clade containing horse dog and cattle through substitution rate estimation between bat and human 32 genes were identified with evidence for positive selection we also identified 466 immune-related genes which may be useful for studying tacaribe virus infection of this species the jamaican fruit bat transcriptome dataset is a resource that should provide additional candidate markers for studying bat evolution and ecology and tools for analysis of the host response and pathology of disease

dengue viruses denv are the causative agents of dengue fever df and dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps a large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance denv infection investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs to study interactions between denv and antibodies these studies indicate that antibody neutralization of denvs is a "multi-hit" phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion the most potently neutralizing mouse mabs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain iii of the dengue envelope e protein one challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse mabs to better understand the human antibody response the human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different denv serotypes here we review studies conducted with immune sera and mabs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple denv serotypes the human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize denv represent a small fraction of the total denv-specific antibody response moreover these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion these studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion the leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement ade which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of fcγr bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes andviruses 2011 3 2375 macrophages here we review results from human animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ade hypothesis by understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance denv it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines
infectious bronchitis virus ibv as an avian coronavirus is still posing a persistent and imminent threat to the poultry industry worldwide here we report that transfection of sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding m and s proteins resulted in the assembly of ibv vlps this is the first report that s protein plus m protein alone were able to be assembled into vlps for coronaviruses we further showed that the generated ibv vlps could induce humoral immune responses in a level comparable to that of inactivated ibv vaccine and more importantly the ibv vlps could elicit significantly higher cellular immune responses than the inactivated ibv vaccine in summary the assembly of ibv vlps with m and s proteins provided a simple strategy for generating vlps for coronaviruses and the generated ibv vlps laid a feasible foundation for the development of an effective vaccine against infection of ibv in the future
emerging and reemerging diseases that result from pathogen host shifts are a threat to the health of humans and their domesticates rna viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases in the present study we showed that a plant-pathogenic rna virus tobacco ringspot virus trsv could replicate and produce virions in honeybees apis mellifera resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body additionally we showed that trsv-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies while intracellular life cycle species-level genetic variation and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined the increasing prevalence of trsv in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival furthermore we showed that trsv was also found in ectoparasitic varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of varroa mites suggesting that varroa mites may facilitate the spread of trsv in bees but do not experience systemic invasion finally our phylogenetic analysis revealed that trsv isolates from bees bee pollen and varroa mites clustered together forming a monophyletic clade importance pathogen host shifts represent a major source of new infectious diseases here we provide evidence that a pollenborne plant virus tobacco ringspot virus trsv also replicates in honeybees and that the virus systemically invades and replicates in different body parts in addition the virus was detected inside the body of parasitic varroa mites which consume bee hemolymph suggesting that varroa mites may play a role in facilitating the spread of the virus in bee colonies this study represents the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen could also be infected and raises awareness of potential risks of new viral disease emergence due to host shift events about 5% of known plant viruses are pollen transmitted and these are potential sources of future host-jumping viruses the findings from this study showcase the need for increased surveillance for potential host-jumping events as an integrated part of insect pollinator management programs yp 2014 systemic spread and propagation of a plant-pathogenic virus in european honeybees apis mellifera mbio 51e00898-13
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov is a newly emerging virus that causes sars with high mortality rate in infected people to study the humoral responses against sars-cov we evaluated nucleocapsid n and spike s proteins-specific antibodies in patients' sera by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa recombinant n and s proteins of sars-cov were purified from transformed e coli serum specimens from 40 sars-cov-infected patients in the convalescent phase were analyzed by western blotting using the purified antigens serial serum specimens from 12 rt-pcr-confirmed sars patients were assayed by elisa using the recombinant n protein as coated antigen by western blotting 97.5% of the sars patients were positive for n proteinspecific antibodies whereas only 47.5% of the samples were positive for s protein-specific antibodies using n protein-based elisa 10 out of the 12 patients were positive for n proteinspecific antibodies and 6 of them showed seroconversion at mean of 16 days after onset of fever immunoblotting was useful for detecting the humoral immune response after sars-cov infection antibodies against sars-cov n protein appear at the early stage of infection therefore n protein-based elisa could serve as a simple sensitive and specific test for diagnosing sars-cov infection
henipaviruses are zoonotic viruses that can cause severe and acute respiratory diseases and encephalitis in humans to date no vaccine or treatments are approved for human use the presence of neutralizing antibodies is a strong correlate of protection against lethal disease in animals however since rna viruses are prone to high mutation rates the possibility that these viruses will escape neutralization remains a potential concern in the present study we generated neutralization-escape mutants using 6 different monoclonal antibodies and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness these data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of cocktails of cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues within the glycoprotein that are important for virus replication and virulence
rabies virus remains an important burden of disease claiming an estimated 60000 lives each year mainly children and having a huge economical and societal cost post-exposure prophylaxis pep is highly effective however in patients that present with neurological symptoms the case-fatality ratio is extremely high >99%. during the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules in particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other mononegavirales paramyxoviruses filoviruses which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies effective rabies antivirals for therapeutic use need to be molecules that can be dosed into the cerebrospinal fluid and that rapidly and potently block ongoing virus replication and as such stop the further spread of the virus antivirals for prophylactic use can also be envisaged and these should be able to prevent infection of peripheral nerve cells and should have the potential to replace the current anti-rabies immunoglobulins that are used in pep
canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide the role of canine parvovirus cpv in canine viral diarrhea is a common health problem in dogs attracting major concern from veterinarians and dog owners across china in this mini-review we summarize the cpv epidemiology in china including its origin prevalence coinfection and the genetic evolution of the virus the review reveals the correlation between cpv-2 infection and seasonality a dog's age/gender/breed/vaccination that cpv-2 is the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in northeast china and that coinfection with other pathogens is a common occurrence the predominant cpv epidemic strains were the new cpv-2a and cpv-2c has shown significant growth trends since 2010 this mini-review will provide valuable information for cpv infections across china and other countries
in 2005 huge epizooty of h5n1 hpai occurred in russia it had been clear that territory of russia becoming endemic for h5n1 hpai in 2006 several outbreaks have occurred to develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies animal models had to be investigated we choose highly pathogenic strain for these studies a/duck/tuva/01/06 belongs to quinghai-like group viruses molecular markers -cleavage site k627 in pb2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic this data was confirmed by direct pathogenic tests ivpi = 3.0 mld 50 = 14log10eid 50 . also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors serological analysis showed wide crossreactivity of this virus with sera produced to h5n1 hpai viruses isolated earlier in south-east asia mean time to death of infected animals was 819+/-018 days first time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels of ifn-gamma il-6 il-10 assuming all obtained data we can conclude that basic model parameters were characterized and virus a/duck/tuva/01/06 can be used to evaluate anti-influenza vaccines and therapeutics
a total of 310 bacterial strains isolated from the porcine gastrointestinal tract were tested for their activity against transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus and other enteric pathogens based on activity the strains probio-38 and probio-37 were selected as potential probiotics and identified as lactobacillus plantarum probio-38 and lactobacillus salivarius probio-37 respectively by 16s rrna gene sequencing supernatants of these strains inhibited tge coronavirus in vitro in st cells without any cytopathic effect even after 72 h of incubation both the strains exhibited high survival in synthetic gastric juice the strains were resistant to 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the 13 enteric bacterial pathogens tested these strains also exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics analyzed the inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens as well as the bile tolerance high survival in gastric juice and the antibiotic resistance indicate that the two isolated bacterial strains are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after proper in vivo experiments
human papilloma virus-like particles hpv vlp serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for hpv we have previously shown that encapsidation of dna expressing the model antigen m/m2 from respiratory syncytial virus rsv in hpv pseudovirions psv is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally because the hpv capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles in this study we asked 1 whether hpv16 vlp administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to hpv16 and 2 whether hpv16 psvencapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both hpv and the antigen delivered by the transgene mice immunized with hpv16 vlp coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from hpv16 challenge microneedle arrays coated with hpv16-m/m2 or hpv16-f protein genes of rsv were then tested and dose-dependent hpv and f-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization and m/m2-specific t-cell responses were detected post rsv challenge respectively hpv16 psv-f immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with hpv16 psv and had reduced rsv viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal rsv challenge in summary hpv16 psv-encapsidated dna delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against hpv and primed for antibody and t-cell responses to rsv antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids although the immunogenicity of the dna component was just above the dose response threshold the hpv-specific immunity was robust taken together these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized hpv psv could provide a practical thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation
a new tentative lyssavirus lleida bat lyssavirus was found in a bent-winged bat miniopterus schreibersii in spain it does not belong to phylogroups i or ii and it seems to be more closely related to the west causasian bat virus and especially to the ikoma lyssavirus
background the current study was conducted to establish animal models including mouse and ferret for the novel avian-origin h7n9 influenza virus findings a/anhui/1/2013 h7n9 virus was administered by intranasal instillation to groups of mice and ferrets and animals developed typical clinical signs including body weight loss mice and ferrets ruffled fur mice sneezing ferrets and death mice peak virus shedding from respiratory tract was observed on 2 days post inoculation d p i for mice and 3-5 d p i for ferrets virus could also be detected in brain liver spleen kidney and intestine from inoculated mice and in heart liver and olfactory bulb from inoculated ferrets the inoculation of h7n9 could elicit seroconversion titers up to 1280 in ferrets and 160 in mice leukopenia significantly reduced lymphocytes but increased neutrophils were also observed in mouse and ferret models the mouse and ferret model enables detailed studies of the pathogenesis of this illness and lay the foundation for drug or vaccine evaluation
22901 a comparison of subcutaneous nasal and combined influenza vaccination ii protection against natural challenge amer j epidem 93 480-486 1971.-monovalent killed influenza ai hong kong vaccine in doses 400 cca units recommended for dvilian use was given to insurance company employees and elderly psychiatric patients by injection nasal spray or a combination of both methods vacdnees and controls were then studied for evidence of immunity to influenza during the 1968-1969 epidemic parenteral vaccination was well tolerated and effective in reducing influenza infection and illness rates in both groups vaccine had no effect on total respiratory illness in the insurance group although total absenteeism was lowered because of the greater effect of influenza over that of colds in causing time lost from work vaccine given by spray into the respiratory tract was ineffective the addition of spray to parenteral vaccination provided no additional advantage over parenteral vaccination alone
